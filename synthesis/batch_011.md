The model applies the controlled vocabulary to the modules, omitting speculative or unsupported classifications. The result is a schema-consistent mapping designed for diagnostic clarity and further organizational insight."

No cross-referencing, interpretation, or narrative explanation is provided: the response directly fulfills the user's detailed format specification for modular structural analysis. The artifact is suitable for downstream analytical or comparative assessment of modular work structures."

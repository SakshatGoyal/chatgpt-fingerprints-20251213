The exchange identifies potential limitations such as cognitive drift, evaluation consistency, ambiguity in scoring dimensions, and possible model overfitting across sequential evaluations. Mitigation tactics and process optimizations are proposed, including rubric anchoring, modular prompt scaffolding, explicit persona deployment, and modular/batch workflows, with the overarching goal of enabling a rigorous, scalable qualitative evaluation framework. No implementation occurs; the session is focused on uncovering boundaries, workflow design considerations, and model behavior diagnostics in preparation for later prompt and rubric development."

The agent systematically sampled all major product categories and meticulously logged the lack of any per-item disclaimers, providing detailed coverage notes, a raw observation log, and explicit documentation of sampling boundaries and site limitations. The findings establish that no distinct disclaimer types were present for line items, supporting downstream UX or compliance investigations that require negative evidence and process traceability."

The user specifies how the AI should integrate meeting transcripts and timestamped screenshots, closely bind content to artifacts, and output a structured scope document centered on problems and user friction points rather than generic user stories or technical feasibility. The conversation refines interaction models for persona collaboration, clarifies output referencing, and narrows formatting and boundary decisions, resulting in a thorough prompt specification workflow."

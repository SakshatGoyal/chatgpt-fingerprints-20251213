I have a Google pay account and I'm trying to remove my bank account link from it but it doesn't allow me to do so because it has some autopays active.

But when I try to cancel the autopays it gives me a message like this

"Dear Customer, your AutoPay mandate revoke has failed due to account not found 768901000231-ICICI Bank."

---

I spoke to the bank manager and she said its something I can cancel through my netbanking account, but I can't find the right path. Could you do so for me?

## ChatGPT (2025-11-12T11:43:56.784572+00:00)

I investigated your ICICI NetBanking dashboard in detail.  The Payments & Transfers area in NetBanking provides options like “Pay Bills,” “Manage Billers” and “Scheduled Transactions,” which are used for one‑time or recurring bill payments set up through the bank.  However, there was no section for UPI AutoPay mandates; the “Scheduled Transactions” filter only includes types like shopping mall transactions or standing instructions, and it doesn’t display any UPI mandates.  

During my research I found that ICICI Bank itself points customers toward its iMobile app for managing UPI mandates.  The bank’s UPI FAQ states that you can view and cancel active UPI mandates from the iMobile app by going to **UPI Payments → UPI Mandates**, selecting the specific mandate and tapping “Revoke”【468269371517415†L88-L107】.  Similarly, Google Pay’s help article explains that recurring UPI payments set up through Google Pay can be cancelled within the Google Pay app by opening your profile, choosing **Autopay**, selecting the mandate under the “Live” tab and then choosing **Cancel Autopay**【468269371517415†L276-L287】.  This suggests that UPI AutoPay mandates are controlled through the UPI app that created them rather than through ICICI’s NetBanking website.

Given that cancelling a UPI AutoPay mandate constitutes a change to your bank account settings, I’m not able to perform that action directly on your behalf.  However, you can follow these steps yourself to revoke the mandates:

1. **Via ICICI iMobile** – Open the iMobile app, log in, go to **UPI Payments → UPI Mandates**, tap the mandate you want to revoke and choose **Revoke**【468269371517415†L88-L107】.
2. **Via Google Pay** – Open Google Pay, tap your profile picture, select **Autopay**, choose the mandate from the **Live** tab and select **Cancel Autopay**【468269371517415†L276-L287】.  
3. Once the mandates are revoked, NetBanking should allow you to unlink your account from Google Pay without showing the “AutoPay mandate revoke has failed” error.

If you still prefer to try NetBanking, the only bank‑side controls are under **Payments & Transfer → My Transactions → Scheduled Transactions**, where you can see and delete standing instructions for regular bill payments.  But for UPI AutoPay mandates specifically, ICICI’s own documentation indicates you need to manage them through the mobile app you used to create them.

Would you like any further help with using the iMobile or Google Pay app to revoke those mandates?

# Research plan execution





## You (2025-08-17T06:48:41.831000+00:00)

Execute the following research plan.

Below is a director-level, **multi‑phase research and synthesis plan** for “context engineering” in the LLM era. It blends rigorous academic review with pragmatic industry/application study, and it honors your preferences: **hybrid theoretical–practical**, **interdisciplinary**, **LLM‑era focus (≈2020–present)**, **inductive thematic analysis with deductive framework creation**, and **startup case studies**. I’ve organized it into four mandated stages, and within each stage I break work into concrete phases, tasks, and deliverables.

---

## Stage 1 — Approach to Gathering Data

*(Strategy, scope, questions, constructs, sampling frame)*

### 1.1 Purpose & Payoff

* **Purpose:** Build an interdisciplinary, LLM‑era map of “context engineering”—what it is, what adjacent communities call it, how it works, and when/why it works—then translate that into **actionable design patterns** and **evaluation playbooks**.
* **Payoff:** A shared vocabulary, an evidence-backed framework, and field-tested guidance for practitioners (product, research, data, and design).

### 1.2 Core Research Questions (RQs)

**Concept & Language**

* **RQ1:** How is “context” defined and operationalized across AI/ML, IR (information retrieval), HCI, cognitive/behavioral science, and data ethics—particularly since the rise of LLMs?
* **RQ2:** What terminological variants map to “context engineering” (e.g., retrieval‑augmented generation, in‑context learning, system prompting, memory, long‑context optimization, attention steering, tool use, instruction following, guardrails)?

**Mechanisms & Efficacy**

* **RQ3:** Which **context levers** (your seed set: **framing, injection, structuring, weighting, boundaries**) measurably improve performance, faithfulness, safety, and user experience? Under what conditions?
* **RQ4:** How do these levers interact (synergies, trade‑offs), and how sensitive are outcomes to model family, temperature, context length, retrieval quality, or domain?

**Evaluation & Causality**

* **RQ5:** What **metrics, experimental designs, and evaluation harnesses** can causally attribute gains to specific context choices (vs. confounds like model size or dataset leakage)?

**Practice & Adoption**

* **RQ6:** How are **industry labs** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Databricks, IBM, others) and **startups** applying these levers in products? Which patterns generalize by domain (health, legal, code, customer support, productivity, data analysis)?

**Governance & Risk**

* **RQ7:** What are the security, privacy, IP, and safety implications of different context strategies (e.g., prompt injection risks, PII leakage via retrieval, copyright)?
* **RQ8:** What guidelines and guardrails best mitigate these risks without crushing utility?

### 1.3 Initial Conceptual Model (for deductive scaffolding)

We will treat “context engineering” as a **design space** with the following **primary levers**:

1. **Framing** (role, audience, intent),
2. **Injection** (RAG, memory, tool outputs, structured KBs),
3. **Structuring** (schemas, templates, workflows, planners),
4. **Weighting** (ordering, repetition, salience cues, reranking),
5. **Boundaries** (constraints, scopes, policies).

**Secondary levers** to track in coding:

* **Compression & Distillation** (summaries, map‑reduce, graph‑based condensation).
* **Temporal Freshness** (recency/resolution strategies, update cadence).
* **Multimodal Context** (text + tables + images/code).
* **Security & Integrity** (prompt‑injection defenses, content provenance).
* **Persistence** (short‑term/long‑term memory, lifecycle rules).
* **Governance & Auditability** (logging, explainability surfaces, citations).

> This model guides coding **deductively**, while our thematic analysis also permits **inductive** emergence of new categories.

### 1.4 Construct Operationalization

* **Independent variables (context levers):** presence/absence, dosage (e.g., number of retrieved chunks), position (top vs bottom), format (table vs prose), explicit priority statements, compression ratio, recency cutoff.
* **Dependent variables (outcomes):** task success rate, groundedness/faithfulness, factual precision/recall, robustness to adversarial content, user effort/time, satisfaction, token/cost efficiency.
* **Covariates/controls:** model family/version, temperature, max tokens, domain difficulty, retrieval recall/precision, dataset familiarity.

### 1.5 Study Design (mixed methods)

* **Systematic literature review** (peer‑reviewed + arXiv + reputable industry whitepapers).
* **Practitioner studies** (interviews, surveys, artifact teardowns).
* **Experiments** (factorial/A–B tests manipulating context levers).
* **Case studies** (depth profiles of 12–18 startups across verticals).
* **Comparative analyses** (industry labs’ frameworks vs academic).

### 1.6 Target Populations

* **Academia:** authors in AI/ML, IR, HCI, cognition/behavior, data ethics (2020–present).
* **Industry labs:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Databricks, IBM Research, plus 4–6 additional leaders.
* **Startups:** RAG tooling/infrastructure, domain applications (health/legal/support/analysis), agentic frameworks, safety/guardrail vendors.
* **Practitioners:** ML engineers, prompt/AI designers, PMs, data scientists, security/privacy leads.

### 1.7 Sampling Methods

* **Systematic search** (defined strings; curated venues).
* **Backward/forward snowballing** (citations & co‑citations).
* **Stratified purposeful sampling** (by domain and lever).
* **Theoretical sampling** (expand where codes show novelty).
* **Diversity targets** (ensure cross‑domain and cross‑org coverage).

### 1.8 Ethics & Governance (cross‑cutting)

* Respect IP/TOS of sources; obtain consent for interviews; protect NDAs.
* Anonymize practitioner data; store securely; pre‑register experimental protocols when feasible.
* Document risks (prompt injection, PII, copyright) in all case write‑ups.

---

## Stage 2 — Data Collection

*(Tools, procedures, instruments, timeline)*

### Phase 2.1 — Corpus Construction (Literature & Grey Sources)

**Tasks**

* Define inclusion criteria: LLM‑era (2020+), relevance to context mechanisms/evaluation, credible outlets.
* Build a **reference library** (e.g., Zotero + shared tags); use PRISMA‑style tracking.
* Capture **grey literature**: official org blogs, whitepapers, standards drafts.
* Record metadata: domain, lever(s) addressed, evaluation setup, metrics, key claims.

**Tools**

* Reference manager; screening platform (e.g., Rayyan); light web scrapers where permitted.

**Deliverables**

* **Master bibliography** + PRISMA diagram; **evidence table** (by lever × outcome).

### Phase 2.2 — Practitioner Insights (Interviews/Surveys/Focus)

**Sampling**

* **N≈30–40 interviews** across labs, startups, and practitioners; **N≈100–200 survey** respondents from practitioner forums.
* Ensure representation by domain and role (eng, design, PM, safety, data).

**Instruments**

* **Semi‑structured interview guide** covering: context strategies used, failure modes, evaluation practices, decision criteria, trade‑offs, governance.
* **Survey** with Likert items on lever usage, perceived efficacy, and constraints; free‑text for patterns.

**Ethics**

* Consent, option to anonymize org/name, secure storage, IRB‑style checklist if institutional.

**Deliverables**

* Transcripts/notes; initial affinity map of practitioner themes.

### Phase 2.3 — Product & System Teardowns (Observational)

**Targets**

* 12–18 **startup case studies** (balanced across verticals); 6–8 **reference products** from major labs.
  **Procedure**
* Public artifact analysis: docs, demos, API references, changelogs; where possible, sandbox trials.
* Code the presence/strength of each lever; note evaluation claims and governance elements.

**Deliverables**

* **Case‑study dossiers** and a **comparative matrix** (lever coverage × domain × maturity).

### Phase 2.4 — Controlled Experiments (Quantitative)

**Design**

* **Factorial experiments** manipulating 2–4 levers at a time (e.g., structuring × weighting × boundaries), with controls for model/temperature/max tokens.
* Tasks: multi‑hop QA, data‑to‑text, code comprehension, retrieval QA, decision support.
* **A–B tests** for specific interventions (e.g., adding explicit boundaries, adding recency filters).
* **Robustness checks:** adversarial injections, conflicting evidence, noisy retrieval.

**Measures**

* Objective metrics (accuracy, groundedness/faithfulness, answer similarity), human‑in‑the‑loop ratings with calibrated rubrics; token/cost/time.

**Deliverables**

* Clean datasets; experiment logs; analysis notebooks.

### Indicative Timeline (12–16 weeks; overlapping)

* **Weeks 1–3:** Corpus build + protocols + instruments.
* **Weeks 3–8:** Literature screening/coding (rolling); interviews/surveys; teardowns.
* **Weeks 6–12:** Experiments.
* **Weeks 10–16:** Synthesis, writing, playbooks, validation workshops.

## Stage 3 — Sense‑Making and Synthesis

*(Analysis plan, causal inference, integration, validation)*

### Phase 3.1 — Coding & Thematic Analysis (Qualitative)

**Process**

* Develop a **codebook** seeded by the lever model; allow **open coding** to surface emergent categories.
* Double‑code 15–20% of items; compute inter‑coder agreement (e.g., Cohen’s κ); reconcile.
* Produce **theme maps**: where fields agree/disagree, gaps, terminological crosswalks.

**Outputs**

* Taxonomy with definitions; **term crosswalk** (what each field/org calls similar ideas); evidence‑backed **design patterns** and **anti‑patterns**.

### Phase 3.2 — Comparative & Bibliometric Analysis

* **Citation and co‑word networks** to locate schools of thought.
* **Cluster comparisons** (academic vs industry; domain vs domain).
* **Heatmaps**: lever usage × outcome claims × evidence strength.

### Phase 3.3 — Quantitative & Causal Analysis

**Approach**

* **Factorial ANOVA / regression** to estimate main and interaction effects of levers.
* **Ablation studies** (remove one lever at a time).
* **Sensitivity analyses** for retrieval quality, temperature, context length.
* **Robustness**: adversarial and out‑of‑distribution stress tests.
* **Attribution**: Shapley‑style or dominance analysis to apportion variance (where appropriate).
* **Pre‑registered hypotheses** for confirmatory segments; exploratory results clearly labeled.

**Outputs**

* Effect sizes per lever; **conditions‑of‑use** tables (when a lever helps/hurts).
* **Causal narratives** tying mechanisms to outcomes with minimal speculation.

### Phase 3.4 — Integrative & Lateral Synthesis (Interdisciplinary)

* Map findings to **cognitive psychology** (schema theory, context‑dependent memory, cognitive load), **behavioral science** (framing effects), **HCI** (interaction scaffolds), **IR** (ranking/reranking), and **data ethics** (consent, provenance, fairness).
* Extract **governance principles** (boundary‑setting, data lineage, audit trails) aligned to context practices.
* Produce a **maturity model** for organizations (from “prompt tinkering” → “context‑first systems”).

### Phase 3.5 — Validation & Critique

* **Expert panel reviews** (academia + industry) on taxonomy and patterns.
* **Red‑team sessions** to probe failure modes (prompt injection, conflicting context).
* **Practitioner workshops** to test the usability of the playbooks and checklists.

  * Weighting (none vs positional prioritization vs explicit salience tags).
* **Control:** Same model family/version, fixed temperature, fixed retrieval recall.
* **Outcomes:** Exact‑match accuracy, **groundedness** (percent of claims backed by supplied context), human rating of usefulness (Likert), token/cost per correct answer.
* **Analysis:** Two‑way ANOVA + post‑hoc; report effect sizes; ablation removing one factor at a time.

### F. Risk Register (abbreviated)

* **Confounds:** Model updates mid‑study → lock versions, record hashes.
* **Selection bias:** Over‑representation of one domain → set quotas in sampling.
* **Goodhart’s law:** Overfitting to proxy metrics → combine automatic + human eval.
* **Data governance:** PII in retrieval corpora → policy + automated PII scanning.
* **Prompt injection:** Red‑team suite; boundary prompts; content provenance checks.

---

* **Rituals:** Weekly synthesis stand‑ups; live data wall; insight sprints after each 10–15 coded items; mid‑study critique with external advisors.
* **Roles:** Research director (you), method lead, bibliographer, experiment engineer, qualitative lead, ethics/privacy lead, domain SMEs.
* **Traceability:** Every pattern links to sources, evidence strength, and counter‑examples.
* **Translation:** We pair each insight with a **design move** (what to do) and an **evaluation move** (how to test it).

# Debris Search Access Request



## You (2025-02-12T00:31:28.719914+00:00)

Can you help me write a message to my boss Rajiv so I'm trying to tell him that we probably need to get some kind of access to open a debris search option but I can't buy it because it's $200 a month so I'm wondering if there's a common user ID we can use for I don't know basically like make one user ID for the whole company to explore de research. Try to make it convincing polite because it is an expensive ask and I'm not sure if he'll go for it.

**Subject:** Access to Debris Search Option

Hi Rajiv,

I’ve been looking into the debris search option, and it seems like we’ll need some level of access to explore it properly. The challenge is that it costs $200 per month, which makes it a bit of a steep investment for an individual license.

Would it be possible to set up a shared company user ID for this? That way, we could evaluate its value collectively before committing to multiple licenses. If there’s another workaround you’d prefer, I’m happy to explore that too. Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

This keeps it polite, acknowledges the cost, and frames the shared ID as a practical solution rather than just an expense. Let me know if you want to tweak the tone!

No, I'm talking about deep research found on ChatGPT just tell him that it has come up with a lot of conversations with Naya and even Yogesh was mentioning that as a benchmark for our experience for our experience

**Subject:** Access to Deep Research on ChatGPT

Hi Rajiv,

The need for access to Deep Research on ChatGPT has come up quite a bit in conversations with Naya, and even Yogesh mentioned it as a benchmark for our experience. It seems like something we’d benefit from exploring further.

The challenge is that it costs $200 per month, so I wanted to check if there’s a way we could set up a common user ID for the company instead of individual subscriptions. This would allow us to evaluate its usefulness collectively before making a bigger commitment.

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,

No, it hasn't come up quite a bit. I would say that Tanya we were having a conversation with Tanya earlier when it came up and recently just in the last meeting even with Yogesh, the same topic came up so and it's a text message so no need for subject line or things like tha.

Hey Rajiv, we were talking to Tanya earlier when the topic of Deep Research on ChatGPT came up, and then again in our last meeting with Yogesh—it seems to be surfacing as a benchmark for our experience. The issue is that access costs $200/month, which is a bit steep for an individual license. Do you think we could set up a shared company user ID to explore it without committing to multiple subscriptions? Let me know what you think.

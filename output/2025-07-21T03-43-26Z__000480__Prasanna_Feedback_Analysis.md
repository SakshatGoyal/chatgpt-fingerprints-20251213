# Prasanna Feedback Analysis

## You (2025-07-21T03:43:26.388000+00:00)

**Goal:**
Analyze a formatted transcript of a 19-minute design meeting to identify and clarify the main points of feedback from Prasanna Rathinasami. The primary objective is to extract a clear, structured set of actionable next steps for the product designer (the user), despite any ambiguity in the original discussion—particularly regarding design direction. If helpful, generate clarifying follow-up questions that could resolve lingering uncertainties. Also, suggest a brief, informal message to thank Prasanna for their input.

**Return Format:**

* A concise, bullet-point summary of key feedback and decisions attributed to Prasanna Rathinasami.
* A bullet list of **specific, actionable next steps** for the product designer to take.
* A short set of **follow-up questions** that could help resolve design-related ambiguities.
* A 1–2 sentence informal **thank-you message** addressed to Prasanna, acknowledging the nature and value of their feedback.

**Warnings & Guardrails:**

* Do **not fabricate** feedback or overinterpret ambiguous statements; note where something is unclear.
* Attribute comments and decisions only when clearly stated in the transcript.
* Use informal, collaborative language in the thank-you message; avoid corporate jargon.
* Be transparent when inferring next steps that are not explicitly stated.

**Context & Additional Elements:**

* The user is a **product designer** seeking to align with the design vision conveyed during the meeting.
* The transcript is formatted and should allow for attribution of remarks.
* The design itself is **not available**, so all insight must be derived from language and context only.
* Prasanna Rathinasami’s feedback is the primary focus and should be emphasized.

**Embedded Execution Persona:**
Use the persona of a **senior design operations strategist** with experience translating ambiguous stakeholder feedback into actionable design direction, and who collaborates closely with both IC designers and cross-functional partners.

Rajiv Kaul: Hi Shat
Sakshat Goyal: Hi there. Good morning.
Rajiv Kaul: morning. Morning.
Prasanna Rathinasami: Hey sakshat, morning
Sakshat Goyal: Hey, good morning doesn't know.
Prasanna Rathinasami: hey thanks for that uh foundational slide. I like that concepts we have to I think if it's a general concept we need to build around it. So we'll love to see what you guys got today and we have a meeting with uh silation team in the afternoon. I'm not sure whether we'll bring up Figma directly today. We we might but uh I just want to make sure like we got a good story to tell.
Rajiv Kaul: Okay. But at least uh even in your discussion if we if we just throw the idea that there's a framework that we'll we'll be presenting soon just to see whether
Prasanna Rathinasami: Yeah, I think uh that m this meeting probably we don't need to but
Rajiv Kaul: Okay.
Prasanna Rathinasami: the next meeting whenever we are presenting to anybody
Rajiv Kaul: Mhm.
Prasanna Rathinasami: to talk in that concept. So maybe you walk us through this uh or or whatever you want to cover cover it today then we'll spend some time on that.
 
 
00:02:34
 
Sakshat Goyal: Uh okay. So I think in that scenario I'll I'll just start with this one. U I I guess you've probably gone through the slides already. So just to give you an overview, this is one approach we took to figure out sorry.
Prasanna Rathinasami: I don't think it was. It's Chris. Chris Chris's feedback. I think it's from the microphone. Yeah. No, continue. No, no, it was not a comment. just audio.
Sakshat Goyal: Okay. So uh this was one approach we took to um just lay the system of how how data can be extracted and surfaced from whether it's 200 accounts or 2,000 accounts whatever that may be.
Prasanna Rathinasami: Some problem with my camera
Sakshat Goyal: Um
Prasanna Rathinasami: video
Sakshat Goyal: we took
Prasanna Rathinasami: started. I know that people are here already.
Sakshat Goyal: yeah um so we took four um categories. The first one being risk densities. So that's whatever the biggest uh blocker is that's common among all your uh deals. So I'm hoping that this can be scaled even across accounts when
 
 
00:03:44
 
Prasanna Rathinasami: Yeah,
Sakshat Goyal: uh
Prasanna Rathinasami: I think uh I think so the way you have put it together I mean Chris I will let you add any feedback. I think what generally what you're saying is if there is anything which you're working on if there is a risk wherever there is a cluster of risk that is one one spotlight area and another is okay I'm looking for a momentum but it's moving then there is you expected something you said something but there is a contra contradictory information silent I like this framework by the way and you can use this app apply across the workbench the only thing I would suggest and ask is when you look at the cellular journey are there things uh which are beyond this elements of framework which will not cover this elements right so for example I'm not I'm just thinking out loud here like you need to do some proactive action like avoidance problem you should have you should potentially follow up with a customer because there is an expiry coming uh I don't know where that will fall in right like some proactive actions where would you put that actually
 
 
00:04:57
 
Sakshat Goyal: I think that that actually might be a good idea for the predefined prompts. So like these summaries end up being whatever the data is as of today and on the side we start proactively um giving suggestions on how how a user can proceed with certain deals. That that might be one way of looking at it.
Prasanna Rathinasami: So that was the problem statement and let me begin by introducing
Chris Faraon: Yeah, I think the problem or at least the challenge with that is that they have to they have to go in and actually go into the to the AI AI prompt, right? But in terms of trying to tell them that these are the things that you should be doing,
Prasanna Rathinasami: We'll walk through
Chris Faraon: I'm
Prasanna Rathinasami: this
Chris Faraon: not sure if we could somehow, you know, bubble it up in that insight, right? Where you see that, you know, maybe headline
Prasanna Rathinasami: zoom
Chris Faraon: uh where
Prasanna Rathinasami: and all
Chris Faraon: they need to something if there's some if
Prasanna Rathinasami: right
Chris Faraon: there's a risk that that they need to either
 
 
00:06:03
 
Prasanna Rathinasami: the data
Chris Faraon: uh be aware of or get some sort of recommendation to to ask the AI.
Prasanna Rathinasami: over these
Chris Faraon: So there has to be some sort of like you know
Prasanna Rathinasami: check into what
Chris Faraon: some sort of a way for and be be alerted right otherwise they wouldn't take action but they wouldn't
Rajiv Kaul: Okay.
Chris Faraon: click on
Rajiv Kaul: Um
Chris Faraon: something
Rajiv Kaul: Chris,
Chris Faraon: on
Rajiv Kaul: I
Chris Faraon: the
Rajiv Kaul: have a question here. Sakshhat uh to you also
Prasanna Rathinasami: are there.
Rajiv Kaul: in the interviews that we took recent interviews.
Chris Faraon: Yeah.
Prasanna Rathinasami: Let's say the analyst want
Rajiv Kaul: Did
Prasanna Rathinasami: to
Rajiv Kaul: we find
Prasanna Rathinasami: some.
Rajiv Kaul: anything or of use that indicates that a a saleserson would look for XY Z on the workbench to take an action?
Prasanna Rathinasami: So it basically sends a pro
Chris Faraon: No, we didn't really go in specific in terms of where they want to see the action, but rather they want to have improved visibility on all the risk as well as any, you know, anything that's um,
 
 
00:07:03
 
Prasanna Rathinasami: the raw data.
Chris Faraon: you know, that's that may be a gap, right? When it comes to their plan or something that could make their their gap, you know, less or decrease the, you know, decrease the um in terms of how can they meet,
Prasanna Rathinasami: This
Chris Faraon: right,
Prasanna Rathinasami: is
Chris Faraon: their plan for that month or for that quarter. So that's kind of the, you know, one of the things they bubbled up in that interview.
Prasanna Rathinasami: some of the you know the
Rajiv Kaul: Sakshi, do you want to comment on that question? Uh,
Prasanna Rathinasami: And
Rajiv Kaul: based on what Chris just explained.
Prasanna Rathinasami: the thread also
Sakshat Goyal: Yeah, actually I think so. So I was part of two uh user interviews and I think most of the conversation was was around what's missing on the page itself.
Rajiv Kaul: Mhm.
Sakshat Goyal: It was more like we want these values, those values. So stuff like that.
Prasanna Rathinasami: reports that
Sakshat Goyal: Um,
Prasanna Rathinasami: till now by the you know people around the world the cyber policy makers are this
 
 
00:07:57
 
Rajiv Kaul: because we are not able to come down to a
Prasanna Rathinasami: So
Rajiv Kaul: very
Prasanna Rathinasami: you just
Rajiv Kaul: clear idea of whether this is a AI generated prescriptive message that we want to put somehow I'm feeling that that's not possible at all right now so should we exclude that from our design exercise sub for Yes.
Chris Faraon: Yeah.
Prasanna Rathinasami: I think see I I'll take a little bit of a different turn. the framework which you put together is a UX framework for AI and nonAI elements too. That's the way I think
Chris Faraon: Heat.
Prasanna Rathinasami: about it
Rajiv Kaul: Okay.
Prasanna Rathinasami: because if I look across the journey which you have put in the top
Rajiv Kaul: Mhm.
Prasanna Rathinasami: across the board uh that's the way I was putting that framework and applying and asking the question. So in the life cycle of anything which the seller does with the buyer uh it could be you're trying to pitch or you're priming for a pitch whatever it is right or you're already in the deal motion you're always thinking about a plan and then you're trying to say okay is there a risk to my plan is there a momentum obstruction to my plan or whatever I had as a point of view in a customer as an opposing point of view or a different data point that's why I see your framework of contradiction risk density and momentum reduction right that's the way I see it so I think you can apply that framework universally across
 
 
00:09:19
 
Prasanna Rathinasami: to say okay in this if there is anything reducing the momentum this is what I say if it is risk this is what I would say I think we we can use that framework as indicators of this is going to slow down this is going to this is a risk I think we can think about it that way now do we need to apply that only in the prompt I don't think So if you want to show only in the summary I don't think so even you can even alert right so for example our traditional alerts where are they like in this page for example like this is due today what happened right we we don't have that section even anywhere right in this summary page
Rajiv Kaul: I think that's a very good point persona to to transition to AI thing from our traditional notifications.
Prasanna Rathinasami: correct
Rajiv Kaul: Okay.
Prasanna Rathinasami: correct Hey,
Rajiv Kaul: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. What do you think Saka? I think that's a brilliant insight right now.
 
 
00:10:16
 
Rajiv Kaul: Yeah.
Sakshat Goyal: Yeah, we should definitely explore that. But uh yeah, we may have to rethink a lot of these cool things that we've added in order to makes make way for those uh new
Rajiv Kaul: What
Sakshat Goyal: ideas to
Prasanna Rathinasami: I think the the concept still remains right.
Rajiv Kaul: is this?
Prasanna Rathinasami: I mean concept still remains around you are giving a a buyerled uh buyerled journey driven workflow across the seller. You are bringing in the blend of UI to give the compartmentalization to contextualize what they are doing and then using that as a guardrail to contextualize your conversational so you can go deep into the insights. In the past dashboards were limiting elements. After that you cannot do much right you can do slice and dice and then after that you're done now you can go more deeper that's what conversation brings you and then if I build it on what we are saying is okay then what we are doing about the traditional hey these are few actions you are supposed to complete you not completed it right where is that piece that's all we are saying we're just adding to it so and then apply that overall framework and then see how we can add the alerts and actions too,
 
 
00:11:49
 
Sakshat Goyal: Yeah.
Prasanna Rathinasami: right? That's way I would I would go about it. I mean, Chris, what do you think
Chris Faraon: Yeah. Yeah, I think it's a good idea. I mean to go even further, I think a lot of the um ways that again based on the interviews, they actually look at their calendar to see what they need to do for that day. So if because they're more, you know, they're relying more on those uh app, right? there your calendar, your Slack, but I think having them to go in here every time, I think that's going to be a challenge because they really don't use even Salesforce, right? They don't they only go in there to manage to create a quote for example, and then they go to Clary for a lot of the forecasting and pip and the funnel management, opportunity management, right? Because they can update everything there. So that's been the, you know, the way that they're working today. And I think if we can change that when it comes to how they can use this to be able to either from their calendar, they be able to know what they need.
 
 
00:12:48
 
Chris Faraon: If there's some risk today, we can just bubble it up on their calendar and they can go in here to click on something, right? To make them go in here and take action or take that insight. That's where I, you know, I want to go when it comes to how we how we see them, you know, the, you know, shifting or changing their the way that, you know, they work today. I don't think we can just force them to go to this workbench to be honest because that's that will take time or or we have to change that muscle memory right that they have today.
Prasanna Rathinasami: Yeah, that that's that's with any app, right? I mean you need to bring in if you bring many things along with it you'll do it right just like how
Chris Faraon: Yeah.
Prasanna Rathinasami: Google maps replace yellow pages overnight it
Chris Faraon: Right.
Prasanna Rathinasami: didn't take it overnight it took over a time
Chris Faraon: It
Prasanna Rathinasami: so we
Chris Faraon: took
Prasanna Rathinasami: all know
Chris Faraon: took
Prasanna Rathinasami: that
Chris Faraon: took a
 
 
00:13:34
 
Prasanna Rathinasami: it's
Chris Faraon: long time. Right.
Prasanna Rathinasami: yeah
Chris Faraon: Yeah.
Prasanna Rathinasami: yeah yeah it took like it's a
Chris Faraon: All
Prasanna Rathinasami: again map was just to give you directions but then we thought okay that's a great place to bring in address phone numbers websites I mean that's the way this is evolving too we are trying to bring this like uh an application
Chris Faraon: right.
Prasanna Rathinasami: where you can do everything you want in your day-today life including quoting because obviously the quoting needs to be reimagined
Chris Faraon: Right.
Prasanna Rathinasami: within that tab. So
Chris Faraon: Try
Prasanna Rathinasami: I think it'll take time to your point but I think if we put the foundation correctly like the way we are putting with a framework and a thought process around okay what are we going to do about alerts now if you use calendar to send the alerts here also that's fine now some alerts could be very event driven and then you are alerting it some alerts are
Chris Faraon: Right.
Prasanna Rathinasami: AIdriven so
Chris Faraon: Right.
Prasanna Rathinasami: we need to differentiate between those two but it's the
 
 
00:14:27
 
Chris Faraon: Mhm.
Prasanna Rathinasami: same place it's the same place Right?
Chris Faraon: Yeah.
Prasanna Rathinasami: It's the same section within which you're going to say this is due today. This is due today and then you can say by the way there is a you expected this to close today. I see a risk in this and then use the risk framework to represent it there. So I think that that that framework is going to help us to talk both AI and non-AI elements in the UI and also in the conversation screen. I mean
Chris Faraon: Yeah.
Prasanna Rathinasami: I mean it's a good good it's a good insight. Thanks Sakshit for triggering our thought with the framework which giving us a gateway to think about.
Sakshat Goyal: Thanks.
Prasanna Rathinasami: Okay.
Sakshat Goyal: Yeah.
Prasanna Rathinasami: I think Sakshit I know you I don't think it is a huge rework for you. You will have to find a place. You remember we were talking what is missing in this thing. We kept on asking there's something overall summary missing.
 
 
00:15:20
 
Prasanna Rathinasami: I think this is
Sakshat Goyal: Yeah.
Prasanna Rathinasami: what I think.
Rajiv Kaul: Yeah.
Chris Faraon: Yeah.
Rajiv Kaul: Right. But I agree with Chris also surfacing uh on calendar because in another project uh
Prasanna Rathinasami: which
Rajiv Kaul: we
Prasanna Rathinasami: is
Rajiv Kaul: did there were deliverables and tasks which were assigned by admin to
Prasanna Rathinasami: a database.
Rajiv Kaul: asset managers.
Prasanna Rathinasami: The system
Rajiv Kaul: So they
Prasanna Rathinasami: can
Rajiv Kaul: were supposed to look at those tasks in advance as well. So that was tightly coupled with the calendar. So when they go to the calendar they see renewal tasks which were spanned in three months but other tasks which were daily or weekly kind of things.
Prasanna Rathinasami: Yes.
Rajiv Kaul: So I agree 100% with Chris on bringing in some design clue of calendar on the workbench that they can go and see on calendar. The other thing is what persona was
Prasanna Rathinasami: I also
Rajiv Kaul: saying visually differentiating that this is a notification and this is a AI insight
Chris Faraon: you know,
Rajiv Kaul: showing
 
 
00:16:18
 
Chris Faraon: or
Rajiv Kaul: that visually
Chris Faraon: I need
Rajiv Kaul: different.
Chris Faraon: to take action now. I think that's the, you know, the ones that I'm referring to when it comes to the calendar
Prasanna Rathinasami: I think I think
Chris Faraon: is
Prasanna Rathinasami: that's
Chris Faraon: more
Prasanna Rathinasami: fantastic
Chris Faraon: is
Prasanna Rathinasami: guys.
Chris Faraon: more like really you got to do it now otherwise, you know, you you're gonna
Prasanna Rathinasami: You you you got it. You got it. So yeah, it is renewing today. You have to act right now
Chris Faraon: Yeah.
Prasanna Rathinasami: or
Chris Faraon: Exactly.
Prasanna Rathinasami: please file an uh asset extension.
Chris Faraon: get
Prasanna Rathinasami: I
Chris Faraon: some
Prasanna Rathinasami: think those are very valid problems.
Chris Faraon: layers. Yep. Exactly.
Prasanna Rathinasami: Yeah.
Chris Faraon: Yeah. So, yeah, I think we should definitely think about in terms of what channel we're going to be using when it comes to the different different types of, you know, alerts, notification to drive, you know, really a red alert, right, to the to the seller.
 
 
00:16:57
 
Prasanna Rathinasami: correct.
Chris Faraon: I think those
Prasanna Rathinasami: I think
Chris Faraon: are
Prasanna Rathinasami: that's
Chris Faraon: things that
Prasanna Rathinasami: a
Chris Faraon: we
Prasanna Rathinasami: great
Chris Faraon: also
Prasanna Rathinasami: use
Chris Faraon: need
Prasanna Rathinasami: case
Chris Faraon: to
Prasanna Rathinasami: what
Chris Faraon: overlay,
Prasanna Rathinasami: you just brought up.
Chris Faraon: right?
Prasanna Rathinasami: Asset expiry is a very common problem in paral now where reps will continue to work on the renewal. They will forget to extend the asset because sometimes if the renewal is delayed by day or two for
Chris Faraon: Yeah,
Prasanna Rathinasami: the code
Chris Faraon: that's
Prasanna Rathinasami: to
Chris Faraon: a
Prasanna Rathinasami: come
Chris Faraon: big
Prasanna Rathinasami: in, they let the asset to expire.
Chris Faraon: a huge Yeah, it's a huge risk or at least
Prasanna Rathinasami: Yeah.
Chris Faraon: rework that they have to go and
Prasanna Rathinasami: Yeah. It's a rework. Lot
Chris Faraon: Yeah,
Prasanna Rathinasami: of rework.
Chris Faraon: it's a rework which makes it hard for you know for them
Prasanna Rathinasami: I
Chris Faraon: to
Prasanna Rathinasami: think I think these is a good use case.
 
 
00:17:26
 
Prasanna Rathinasami: The framework is great.
Rajiv Kaul: Let's
Prasanna Rathinasami: Let's bring in the alert. Within the alert, we'll talk about do we need to bring a calendar aspect to it or it's more a dateriven aspect, timeline driven aspect, right? Okay, good. So, let's make that. Anything else you want to share today?
Sakshat Goyal: Uh no actually just my next step was going to be try to uh refine that prototype based on the AI framework that I shared with you and I guess working on what we just discussed this morning.
Prasanna Rathinasami: Okay, let's do that. Monday, Lavina will be back. So, I don't want to come and say, hey, is that all we have done in one week?
Sakshat Goyal: Okay.
Chris Faraon: Yeah.
Prasanna Rathinasami: Uh, so let's be prepared for uh that question uh because now you all have used to that question.
Chris Faraon: Yeah.
Prasanna Rathinasami: So,
Chris Faraon: I think Amy was very happy with this one. Actually, she we showed this. We've been meeting with Amy as well.
Prasanna Rathinasami: and that's
Chris Faraon: So,
Prasanna Rathinasami: good.
Chris Faraon: she's
Prasanna Rathinasami: I mean
Chris Faraon: is very
Prasanna Rathinasami: you know what I
Chris Faraon: Yeah.
Prasanna Rathinasami: I think uh Amy and uh Sil Shalar stakeholder management too uh want to make sure like they are all traveling along with us
Chris Faraon: Mhm.
Prasanna Rathinasami: and giving inputs.
Chris Faraon: Right. Yeah.

### Key feedback & decisions from **Prasanna Rathinasami**

- **Framework endorsement**  
  *Likes the three-lens framework* (Risk Density, Momentum Reduction, Contradiction) and sees it as a universal UX scaffold for both AI-generated and traditional data.  
- **Coverage gaps**  
  Notes that *proactive, time-based tasks* (e.g., asset-expiry follow-ups) aren’t captured by the current lenses; these need a home in the experience.  
- **Alerts & actions**  
  Recommends a *dedicated alerts section* that surfaces both event-driven (“due today”) and AI-driven insights, with *clear visual differentiation* between the two.  
- **Calendar integration**  
  Align urgent “act-now” items with sellers’ existing behavior (checking calendars/Slack). Consider surfacing red-alert tasks directly on or from a calendar view.  
- **Storytelling for stakeholders**  
  Wants a compelling narrative around the framework before showing raw Figma files; next meetings should “talk in that concept.”  
- **Upcoming expectation**  
  Prototype refinements based on today’s discussion should be ready for Monday’s session with Lavina—team should be able to answer “what’s new this week?”

---

### Actionable next steps for the product designer

1. **Refactor the prototype**
   - Add an **Alerts/“To-Do Today” module**; visually separate  
     - *Event-driven* (calendar/timeline icon + neutral color)  
     - *AI-driven* (spark icon + accent color)  
2. **Map the framework across the seller journey**  
   - Audit each screen for where Risk, Momentum, Contradiction indicators logically appear.  
3. **Design calendar touch-points**  
   - Quick concept: badge critical alerts on embedded mini-calendar; explore push to Outlook/Google.  
4. **Capture proactive scenarios**  
   - Document high-frequency cases (asset expiry, quote follow-up, renewal deadlines) and show how they trigger event-driven alerts.  
5. **Prep stakeholder story deck**  
   - Narrative arc: *Problem → Framework → Unified alerts → Seller workflow change* (screenshots optional).  
6. **Monday readiness checklist**  
   - Updated Figma flow + alert visuals  
   - One-slide summary of “week’s progress” to answer Lavina’s prompt.

---

### Follow-up questions to unblock remaining design decisions

1. Where in the existing layout should the new **Alerts module** live (top summary vs. side panel)?  
2. What **visual style** best distinguishes AI insights from standard notifications without overwhelming the UI?  
3. Should calendar integration be **read-only highlights** or allow in-context actions (e.g., “Slide renewal date”)?  
4. Which **proactive scenarios** (asset expiry, pricing refresh, contract renewal, etc.) are **highest-impact** to prototype first?  
5. How granular should AI recommendations be in the alert itself versus the deeper conversation panel?

---

### Quick thank-you note to Prasanna

> Hey Prasanna—thanks a ton for the sharp feedback today! Your push to broaden the framework and weave in clear, action-oriented alerts really helps tighten the experience. Appreciate you steering us toward a story that clicks with sellers. 🙌

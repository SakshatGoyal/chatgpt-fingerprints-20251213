In the transcript, John refers to "drivers" multiple times, particularly in the context of data analysis and tools. From the lines found, here's how John defines and uses the term:

- **"Drivers"** refer to factors or elements that influence other metrics, such as **sentiment** or **concept dimensions**.
- There is mention of **drivers tools** and **drivers charts** in the dashboard, which appear to be tools for analyzing and scoring factors that affect performance (e.g., **CSAT** or **NPS** scores).
- Andrew explains that **drivers** can be broken down into categories or buckets (e.g., "5 drivers"), and data is grouped accordingly for further analysis.

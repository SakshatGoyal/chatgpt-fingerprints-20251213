Looking at screenshots like this from *Iron Man* (2008), it’s not obvious that Tony Stark—or Robert Downey Jr. himself—wears any rings as jewelry in the films.

According to an article detailing hidden details in the *Iron Man* movies, several characters—including Tony Stark, Obadiah Stane, James Rhodes, and Raza—do wear rings in the first film, meant to symbolize the power each character wields citeturn0search10. However, a closer read suggests that these are part of the scene’s symbolism and focus more on supporting characters (and perhaps generically), rather than prominently accessorizing Tony Stark with rings as jewelry.

There’s no strong visual or documented confirmation that Robert Downey Jr. wears rings purely as personal jewelry in any of the *Iron Man* films—most references to rings tie into props or supporting characters, not Stark himself (as far as publicly available information goes).

So to answer your question: there's no notable evidence that Robert Downey Jr., portraying Tony Stark, wears rings simply as jewelry in the Iron Man films.

If you're curious about other accessories he does wear—like his character’s iconic watches—I’d be happy to dig into those!

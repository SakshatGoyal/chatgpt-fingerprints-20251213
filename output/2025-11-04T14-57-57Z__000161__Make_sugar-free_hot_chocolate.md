Super simple — here’s how you can make a rich, sugar-free hot chocolate with just cocoa powder and milk 👇  

### 🥛 Ingredients
- 1 cup milk (any kind — cow’s milk, oat, soy, or almond)  
- 1 to 1½ tbsp **unsweetened cocoa powder**  
- Optional: a few drops of **vanilla extract**, **pinch of salt**, or a **natural sweetener** (like stevia, monk fruit, or a date)

### 🔥 Method
1. **Warm the milk** — pour it into a small saucepan and heat gently (don’t boil).  
2. **Mix cocoa** — in a mug or bowl, add the cocoa powder.  
3. **Make a paste** — add 2 tbsp of warm milk to the cocoa and stir until smooth and lump-free.  
4. **Combine** — pour the rest of the warm milk in while stirring continuously.  
5. **Optional flavoring** — add a pinch of salt and/or vanilla extract for balance.  
6. **Taste and adjust** — if you want sweetness, stir in a bit of stevia or blend in one soaked date.

💡 **Pro tip:** blending it for 10 seconds (even with a hand blender) makes it creamy and frothy like café-style cocoa.

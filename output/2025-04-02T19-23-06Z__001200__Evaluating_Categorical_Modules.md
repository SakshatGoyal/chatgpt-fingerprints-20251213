# Evaluating Categorical Modules

## You (2025-04-02T19:23:06.178000+00:00)

Hey Michael, I'm attaching an evaluation guide. I want you to take a close look at it and tell me about some ambiguities and issues that people might have while evaluating a categorical module. Now a categorical module is simply a text module that has some piece of information, like it has some insight, it has some strategic decision-making context, and it has some supporting context, all of which was extracted from different research papers. We have about a thousand modules now. What we need is for people to use this evaluation guide and essentially tag each module against the various fields that are defined here. However, there's one problem. Now a lot of papers or a lot of modules, I should say, contain sort of recommendations that, you know, this is what people, this is what companies should do, and this is what executives should do, and this is what brands should do. You know, those kinds of recommendations don't often translate into real-world action. Our goal right now is simply to understand what's happening in reality. What is the paper telling us about today's situation? But that's very hard to communicate to someone clearly. I don't necessarily want to make the document longer, but I'm wondering if there are ways we could surface this nuance and make it, first of all, not just make it explicitly clear, but also figure out what we can do when someone encounters these sort of recommendations.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-02T19:23:08.232991+00:00)

Thanks for the detailed context—this evaluation guide is rich and tightly constructed, and your concern is a really insightful one. You're trying to get evaluators to identify what’s *actually* going on in a situation—what the research says *is happening*—but modules often include *normative recommendations* that obscure that distinction. Let’s break this down.

---

## 🔍 **Key Ambiguity: Descriptive vs. Normative Statements**
The fundamental problem you’re describing is this:

> Many modules contain **prescriptive language** ("Executives should do X") that doesn’t necessarily reflect what executives *are* doing.

Yet the goal of evaluation is to surface **real-world patterns and decisions**—not aspirations or advice. Evaluators might:

- Mistake **normative guidance** for a real action or trend.
- Tag **recommendations** as actual decisions or behaviors.
- Over-interpret **wishful statements** as evidence of strategic clarity or alignment.

---

## ✳️ Where This Friction Might Appear in the Evaluation Process

### 1. **Insight Statement** Interpretation
- If the insight is *framed as an ideal*, evaluators may assume it reflects actual behavior rather than an observation or summary from the research.
- Evaluators might tag "capability-building" or "alignment" based on *recommendation phrasing*, not actual events.

**Suggestion:** Clarify that evaluators should distinguish between *observed behavior* and *prescriptive framing*. Perhaps use a heuristic like:
> “Did this *actually* happen, or is it something someone *wants* to happen?”

---

### 2. **Framing Move & Stabilizer Tags**
- **Values Frame**, **Urgency Frame**, or **Capability Frame** may be incorrectly applied if the evaluator reads aspirational language as action.
- **Locked In** might be tagged just because a recommendation sounds bold, even if no irreversible commitment was made.

**Suggestion:** Add subtle reminders in tag descriptions:
> ✅ What it is: A real shift or action, not just a stated recommendation.  
> ❌ What it’s not: A “should” or “could” scenario without clear follow-through.

---

### 3. **False Clarity + Performed Buy-In**
These categories can help—but evaluators need to be nudged to *look for disconnects* between rhetoric and action.

**Suggestion:** When encountering strong recommendations, prompt evaluators to ask:
> “Is this backed by behavior or just presented as alignment?”

---

### 4. **Tension Axis and Organizational Implications**
Prescriptive statements may sound like attempts to manage tension (e.g., “We should balance short-term and long-term priorities”), but they don’t mean a real tension was navigated.

**Suggestion:** Encourage tagging only when **contradictions are surfaced through action**, not through idealized framing.

---

## 🧠 How to Help Evaluators Navigate This

Without making the guide longer, consider these light-weight, high-impact additions:

---

### ✅ Add a Quick “Reality Check” Box Near the Top
Right after the “While Evaluating” section:

> **🪞 Reality Check:**  
> Ask yourself: *Is this describing what actually happened—or what someone wishes would happen?*  
>  
> - Focus on observed decisions, behaviors, and tensions.  
> - Be skeptical of “should,” “must,” and “ought to” language.  
> - If it’s unclear whether something happened, don’t assume it did.

---

### 🧰 Add a Mini Sidebar to a Few Tags (Framing Moves, Stabilizers)
For example:

> **❗Caution:**
> Many modules include **prescriptive language**. Only use this tag if there’s **clear evidence** the decision was made this way—not just suggested.

---

### 📎 Create a Companion “Evaluator Cheat Sheet”
Even a one-pager outside the guide could contain red flags like:
- 🚩 *“Companies need to…”* → Recommendation, not action.
- 🚩 *“This suggests leaders should…”* → Opinion, not evidence.
- ✅ *“The team launched despite uncertainty…”* → Behavior worth tagging.

---

## 💡 What to Do When They Encounter These Recommendations?

When a module contains **only** normative content with no clear descriptive signal, evaluators should be encouraged to:
- Tag the relevant interpretive category as `Unknown`.
- Add a short comment: *"This section contains recommendations, not observed behavior."*

You might even standardize this with a short label like:
> `Note: Recommendation only – no observable decision or framing.`

---

Would you like help drafting a short “Evaluator Tip Sheet” or annotating a sample module with this lens? That could reinforce the nuance without expanding the guide itself.

### CATEGORICAL MODULE 79 - C1-I7

Dynamic, At-Risk, and Parallel Resource Deployment
Insight Statement:
Adopting dynamic and parallel resource allocation models enables organizations to pivot quickly based on emerging clinical and market data, thus mitigating the risks of static, traditional budgeting practices. [Empirical]

Executive Decision-Making Context:
Executives have long operated under the assumption that rigid resource allocation minimizes risk. However, the evidence from accelerated COVID-19 vaccine development and Flagship Pioneering's model indicates that embedding agility—by testing assets concurrently with defined risk thresholds—can lead to earlier identification of blockbuster potentials. This approach forces a rethinking of risk versus reward in R&D investments.

Supporting Context:
The paper details how conducting process steps in parallel (even before full preclinical data is available) shortened development timelines, and how small, rigorously managed teams can quickly pivot if proof of concept is not achieved. This dynamic allocation strategy suggests that more aggressive, data-informed resource deployment could yield substantial gains in R&D productivity. [Empirical]

## ChatGPT (2025-04-02T19:24:41.857751+00:00)

Thanks for sharing these—this sample set is incredibly useful. You're clearly working with high-quality modules that are rigorously annotated and structured. That said, your concern is right on the mark: **even empirically grounded modules often carry normative undertones**—which can quietly shift the evaluator’s perception from “what happened” to “what should happen.”

Let me walk you through a few key ambiguities and pain points evaluators are likely to encounter across this set, along with some **practical suggestions** for sharpening the guide or supporting evaluators without making it longer.

---

## 🎭 Key Ambiguities in These Modules

### 1. **Prescriptive Language Embedded in Empirical Narratives**

Even when tagged as `[Empirical]`, the modules frequently include **action-oriented verbs and normative cues**, which can confuse evaluators.

**Examples:**

- Module 72:  
  > “Executives must reevaluate their reliance on traditional therapeutic investments...”  
  That “must” makes it sound like a recommendation—even though it’s followed by empirical backing.

- Module 41:  
  > “A cautious yet forward-thinking approach is required...”  
  Who requires it? The data? The author? The field?

- Module 56:  
  > “Executives are increasingly compelled to adopt leapfrog digital innovation...”  
  “Compelled” implies a behavioral shift—but the actual action being taken may still be unclear.

**Evaluator Risk:** These blur the line between **descriptive framing** and **prescriptive advocacy**, potentially triggering incorrect tags like `Values Frame`, `Urgency Frame`, or even `True Clarity`.

---

### 2. **Hypotheticals Framed as Likely Outcomes**

Several modules include **conditional logic** masked as real dynamics.

**Example – Module 40:**
> “Targeted investments *could* counterbalance these pressures…”

**Evaluator Risk:** Evaluators might read this as a strategic move that has already occurred, rather than as a hypothetical or recommendation, leading to false positives in tags like `Tested First` or `Locked In`.

---

### 3. **Empirical Context Anchored by Strategic Advice**

Sometimes, the **supporting context is robustly empirical**, but the **insight and framing layer** leans advisory.

**Example – Module 63:**
> “...underscoring the urgent need for strategic innovations...”  
> “...could streamline operations…”

This blends real conditions with a call to action.

**Evaluator Risk:** It may nudge evaluators to tag for behaviors (e.g., `Capability Frame`) that haven’t occurred—just been urged.

---

### 4. **Inferred Judgments Embedded in Framing Language**

Words like “essential,” “foundational,” or “imperative” carry value judgments that imply action is obvious, necessary, or underway.

**Example – Module 46:**
> “A clearly defined and collaboratively developed vision and mission is foundational...”

Even though this is tagged `[Inferred]`, the phrasing creates **false certainty** about adoption.

**Evaluator Risk:** This can mislead evaluators into believing there’s alignment or clarity (`True Clarity`, `Alignment Achieved`) when in fact the data may not support that conclusion.

---

## 💡 How to Surface This Distinction for Evaluators

Without extending the core document, here are three possible approaches:

---

### 1. ✅ Add an **Interpretation Rule of Thumb** (right up top)

Under “While Evaluating,” insert this lightweight, memorable test:

> **Reality vs. Recommendation?**  
> Before tagging, ask: *Is this what happened—or what someone thinks should happen?*  
>  
> - “Executives did X” → Evaluate as action  
> - “Executives must / should / could do X” → Be cautious. That’s likely advice.

This reinforces the idea that **not all forward-looking or action-sounding language implies a real decision**.

---

### 2. 🧠 Add a Tagging Flag for “Normative Drift”

Create an optional, non-scoring label—maybe called `Normative Drift`—to flag when a module:

- Blends evidence with advice
- Embeds should/ought/could language
- Is ambiguous about whether something *has* or *should* happen

This flag wouldn’t affect scoring but could help evaluators articulate confusion and give your team a signal that a module may need clarification or reframing later.

---

### 3. 🧾 Add a Micro Glossary of Red Flags (in a Tip Sheet or Sidebar)

Provide a short list of **language signals** that often indicate normative (vs. empirical) content:

| **Red Flag** Phrase | Likely Interpretation |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| "must," "should," "need to" | Recommendation, not action |
| "essential," "imperative," "foundational" | Author's value judgment |
| "expected to" without evidence | Hypothetical, not descriptive |
| "could / can / may enable" | Potential, not observed behavior |

Then follow with:

> When you see these phrases:  
> ✅ Look for **concrete behavior** or **organizational evidence**  
> ❌ Don’t assume intent equals action

---

## 🛠 What to Do When Evaluators Encounter It

Here’s a simple, scalable instruction:

> 🔎 If the module contains mostly **prescriptive or aspirational** language—  
> - Tag as `Unknown` in appropriate categories (e.g., Framing Move, Stabilizer)  
> - Add a note: *“Contains strategic recommendation, but unclear if acted upon.”*

This approach acknowledges ambiguity without forcing false certainty.

---

Would you like me to mock up a one-page Evaluator Tip Sheet (PDF-style) summarizing these cues and heuristics? It could work as a training or onboarding reference and stay completely separate from the core guide.

## You (2025-04-02T19:28:53.568000+00:00)

I like you're idea of a micro glossary. Lets work on that. 


I'm attaching a random collection of text files that have these categorical modules. Read through them individually and extract any red flag phrases to look for.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-02T19:28:54.996738+00:00)

Great—after a deep read through the modules in your uploaded files, I’ve compiled a **Micro Glossary of Red Flag Phrases** that evaluators can use to identify when a module might be drifting into **normative or aspirational territory**, even if it's tagged as empirical.

These phrases show up frequently across your modules and often signal **prescriptive intent**, **hypothetical outcomes**, or **implicit judgments** that can be misread as actual decisions or behaviors.

---

## 🔍 **Micro Glossary: Red Flag Phrases for Normative Drift**

These phrases fall into four thematic buckets—each one reflects a **common way that recommendations masquerade as reality**.

---

### 📌 **Category 1: Pseudo-Action Language**  
> Sounds like action, but often just sets a strategic intention or desired outcome.

| **Phrase** | **Why It’s Risky** |
|------------|--------------------|
| “Executives must…” | Normative prescription, not a description of behavior. |
| “Leaders are encouraged to…” | Suggestion, not evidence of adoption. |
| “Should prioritize…” | Indicates ideal behavior, not observed practice. |
| “Must balance…” | Common setup for a tension, but often aspirational. |
| “Need to rethink…” | Advice masquerading as insight. |

---

### 📌 **Category 2: Conditional / Hypothetical Framing**  
> Often implies possibility, not actual behavior.

| **Phrase** | **Why It’s Risky** |
|------------|--------------------|
| “Could unlock…” | Hypothetical benefit, not realized outcome. |
| “If implemented correctly…” | Assumes future potential, not existing action. |
| “May result in…” | Possibility, not a causal claim. |
| “Expected to deliver…” | Projected outcome—needs evidence of realization. |
| “Potentially offers…” | Signals speculation. |

---

### 📌 **Category 3: Value-Laden Signals**  
> Uses emotionally or strategically charged words that imply the “right” path.

| **Phrase** | **Why It’s Risky** |
|------------|--------------------|
| “Essential to…” | Suggests necessity without proof of adoption. |
| “Foundational for…” | Overstates importance—often authorial judgment. |
| “Strategic imperative” | Strong rhetoric, often aspirational. |
| “Critical enabler” | Sounds urgent, but may lack behavioral evidence. |
| “Key to unlocking…” | Suggests centrality without showing decision link. |

---

### 📌 **Category 4: Generalized Behavioral Attribution**  
> Over-generalizes from survey stats or trends.

| **Phrase** | **Why It’s Risky** |
|------------|--------------------|
| “Executives are increasingly adopting…” | Often implies trend without specifics. |
| “Organizations now realize…” | Collective framing that masks variance. |
| “Firms are shifting toward…” | Needs to be backed by concrete cases. |
| “There is a growing belief that…” | Observational, not behavioral. |
| “The data suggests organizations should…” | Blends data with normative extrapolation. |

---

## ✅ Bonus: What to Do When You Spot These

If evaluators encounter red flag phrases **without direct evidence** of real behavior or organizational shifts:

- Tag the interpretive category as `Unknown`
- Leave a short note like:  
  _“Contains prescriptive framing; unclear if action has occurred.”_

---

Would you like this turned into a **one-page printable reference sheet** for evaluators? I can format it in a clean layout with icons and a bit of visual hierarchy—something to keep handy while tagging.

## You (2025-04-02T19:31:08.472000+00:00)

ok, now build on top of your existing categories by knowledge from these files. You can either add categories, or expand on the categories. 

However, make sure you don't unnecessarily add redundancies. Only add if its essential for someone to know in order to flag those ambiguities.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-02T19:31:10.044508+00:00)

Based on the additional modules and their language patterns, here’s an expanded and refined version of the **Micro Glossary of Red Flag Phrases**, grouped into conceptually meaningful categories. I’ve incorporated new patterns and expressions from the recent files *only where they add unique interpretive risk*. This keeps things lean, avoids redundancy, and ensures evaluators are equipped to flag ambiguous or misleading cues.

---

## 🔍 **Micro Glossary of Red Flag Phrases – Expanded Edition**

Each category now includes:
- **Updated descriptions**
- **New phrase patterns drawn from uploaded data**
- **Subtler framing cues and interpretive traps**

---

### 🧩 Category 1: **Pseudo-Action Language**  
> Phrases that imply decisions or behaviors have occurred—but actually describe intent, framing, or recommendations.

| **Phrase** | **Interpretive Risk** |
|------------|------------------------|
| “Executives must…” | Prescriptive; no evidence action has occurred. |
| “Leaders are encouraged to…” | Suggestion or advice, not empirical behavior. |
| “Should prioritize…” / “Should adopt…” | Ideal, not observed. |
| “It is imperative to…” | Authorial judgment masked as necessity. |
| “Calls for…” / “Advocates for…” | Policy prescription, not a description of real decisions. |
| “Are urged to…” | Normative push; not a reflection of behavior. |
| “Emerges as a strategic imperative” | Inflates importance without confirming organizational uptake. |
| “Executives are advised to…” | Strong recommendation posing as trend. |

🧠 **Evaluator Tip**: Ask, *“Did someone actually do this, or is it a proposed ideal?”*

---

### 🔮 Category 2: **Conditional / Hypothetical Framing**
> Describes what *might* happen or *could* be possible—but may be misread as actual results.

| **Phrase** | **Interpretive Risk** |
|------------|------------------------|
| “Could unlock…” / “Can deliver…” | Speculative benefit, not realized. |
| “May result in…” / “May lead to…” | Hypothetical outcome, not outcome evidence. |
| “Expected to improve…” | Often projective; check if results followed. |
| “If implemented correctly…” | Sets up a condition, not an actual decision path. |
| “Would likely…” | Counterfactual or model-based assumption. |
| “Anticipated benefit…” | Forward-looking—needs verification. |

🔍 *Double-check outcomes against “Supporting Context” for actual validation.*

---

### 📣 Category 3: **Value-Laden and Overconfident Framing**
> Loaded language that implies strategic “rightness” without grounding it in action or consensus.

| **Phrase** | **Interpretive Risk** |
|------------|------------------------|
| “Critical enabler…” / “Strategic linchpin…” | Inflates importance; often untested. |
| “Foundational to…” / “Core pillar of…” | Often used to assert centrality without stakeholder adoption. |
| “Key to unlocking…” | Metaphorical, not empirical. |
| “Represents a paradigm shift” | May be author’s narrative device. |
| “Game-changer…” | Rhetoric, not evidence. |

📏 *Evaluate whether the framing is backed by multiple stakeholders, outcomes, or just one viewpoint.*

---

### 🎲 Category 4: **Overgeneralization from Trends or Surveys**
> These phrases sound empirical but often rely on selective or non-representative data.

| **Phrase** | **Interpretive Risk** |
|------------|------------------------|
| “Executives are increasingly adopting…” | Trend suggestion, often based on survey data. |
| “The data suggests organizations should…” | Often blurs descriptive findings with normative interpretation. |
| “Companies now realize…” / “There is growing recognition that…” | May be inferred from a small sample or isolated case. |
| “Emerging consensus…” | Rarely backed by full cross-sectoral agreement. |
| “Stakeholders expect…” | Whose stakeholders? Needs clarification. |

📊 *Look for specificity: Who, when, how many, and what kind of organization?*

### 🌀 Category 5: **Cognitive and Cultural Drift Indicators**
> Often used to smuggle in psychological or cultural interpretations without grounding in behavior.

| **Phrase** | **Interpretive Risk** |
|------------|------------------------|
| “Implicit bias leads to…” | Unless backed by interviews or experimental data, may be speculative. |
| “There is a tendency to assume…” | Watch for generalizations; not every context shares this bias. |
| “Conventional wisdom dictates…” | Appeals to assumptions rather than decisions. |
| “Deep-seated beliefs…” / “Legacy mindsets…” | Cultural framing, but may lack evidence of effect on decisions. |
| “Overconfidence in X leads to…” | Powerful framing—check for quotes, behaviors, or metrics. |

🧠 *Ask: Is this a documented mental model—or a hypothesis?*

### ⚖️ Category 6: **Policy-Framing Disguised as Descriptive Insight**
> These phrases often reflect the author’s or journal’s strategic viewpoint, not what actually happened.

| **Phrase** | **Interpretive Risk** |
|------------|------------------------|
| “Needs to be embedded into…” | Prescription, not proof of action. |
| “Underscores the importance of…” | Summary statement—look for substantiation. |
| “Highlights the necessity of…” | Value signal, not a strategic move. |
| “Suggests a shift toward…” | Describes direction, not completion. |
| “Compels organizations to…” | Strong rhetorical device; check if compulsion occurred. |

🧭 *Is this framing linked to specific decisions, pilots, or structural changes?*

## ✅ Final Additions to Micro Glossary: New Patterns Worth Watching

### ✴️ **Subtle Cues That Sound Neutral but Aren’t**
These phrases *feel* like background info but actually carry interpretive weight:

- “Evidence indicates that organizations are beginning to…” → Look for actual change mechanisms.
- “Reflects a broader movement toward…” → Movement or isolated study?
- “The findings suggest…” → Useful, but must distinguish between author inference and data-backed behavior.

Would you like this assembled into a **taggable reference sheet for evaluators** with color-coded flags and examples from your actual modules? I can mock that up next—or generate an editable Google Doc version if you want to collaborate on phrasing.

## You (2025-04-02T19:42:52.802000+00:00)

ok now here's a critical look. 

this is tricky - Lets go category by category:

Category 1: Pseudo-Action Language

“It is imperative to…” one thing I've tried to do is to avoid any speculative references within summaries. All the content is coming directly from research papers. However, there are times that phrases like “It is imperative to…” are still valid to understand the context behind a problem, which further ties back to some of our tagging system introduced in the .md file i attached at the beginning. 

Also, “Emerges as a strategic imperative”, that's critical information for anyone who's evaluating things like ambiguity type and frictional archetypes. 

Category 2: Conditional / Hypothetical Framing:
Phrases that I'm fine with flagging:
“Could unlock…” / “Can deliver…”
“Would likely…”

However, the rest, its easy to confuse what the author is saying themselves, and the context of the story. So we'll need to be carefull. 

“May result in…” / “May lead to…”, “Expected to improve…”, “If implemented correctly…”, “Anticipated benefit…”... these phrases are at times used to convey the author's point of view, but at the same time are also used in many places to describe the situational context the module is describing. About what leaders were expecting, about what they were anticipating, etc...

Category 3: Value-Laden and Overconfident Framing

Same applies. A lot of these words are actually at times explaining situational context.

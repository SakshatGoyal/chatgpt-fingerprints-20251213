# K-Drama OST Rankings

## You (2025-03-18T12:03:39.200000+00:00)

I want you to do an exhaustive research online for Korean dramas which I can watch on Netflix or Amazon prime which also have English audio so I don't wanna watch Korean dramas in Korean. I want to watch them in English and you can sort them based on how popular their songs were so for example, if there's a show that had like super popular songs that show will be at the top and if there is a show that had some mediocre following for its songs. It would be somewhere in the middle and you get the rest.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-18T12:03:53.183560+00:00)

Below is a curated list of Korean dramas you can watch on Netflix or Amazon Prime that come with English audio (dubbed) options. They’re ordered roughly by how much their original soundtracks made waves in popular culture—with the top entries having hit songs that frequently topped charts, and those lower on the list having more modestly followed OSTs. (Keep in mind that availability of English dubs can vary by region.)

---

### Top Tier – Iconic, OST‐Heavy Dramas

**1. Goblin (Guardian: The Lonely and Great God)**  
• *Why:* Its OST is legendary—with tracks like “I Will Go to You Like the First Snow” and “Stay With Me” that have become cultural touchstones.  
• *Where:* Often available on Netflix (check your region for English dub options).  
*(Reference: citeturn0search7)*

**2. Crash Landing on You**  
• *Why:* This drama’s soundtrack spawned several chart-toppers that resonated worldwide.  
• *Where:* Streaming on Netflix—with English audio available in select regions.  
*(Reference: citeturn0news34)*

---

### Mid Tier – Beloved Soundtracks with Solid Followings

**3. Itaewon Class**  
• *Why:* While not as OST‐iconic as the two above, its memorable tracks have a strong following.

**4. Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo**  
• *Why:* Its charming and upbeat soundtrack is a fan favorite, adding to the series’ warm vibe.

*(Reference: citeturn0search2)*

---

### Lower Tier – Dramas with More Modest OST Impact

**6. W: Two Worlds Apart**  
• *Why:* Its mix of fantasy and romance is enhanced by a unique—but more under-the-radar—soundtrack.  
• *Where:* Check regional offerings on Netflix or Prime for English audio versions.

**7. Marriage Contract**  
• *Why:* This drama’s emotional narrative is supported by a decent soundtrack, though its songs haven’t quite reached blockbuster status.  
• *Where:* Streaming on Amazon Prime Video with English audio in certain regions.

---

### A Few Quick Reminders

• **Regional Variability:** Not every show may have an English dub in all regions. It’s a good idea to check your local Netflix or Amazon Prime catalog.  
• **Soundtrack Popularity:** The ranking here reflects overall cultural impact and chart performance of the OSTs—from smash hits (like those from Goblin) to more modest but enjoyable tunes (as in Marriage Contract).

This list blends extensive research on OST impact with the availability of English audio options on major streaming platforms. Enjoy your viewing (and listening)!

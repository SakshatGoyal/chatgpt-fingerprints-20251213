OpenAI's "GPT-4o with Scheduled Tasks" feature, introduced in early 2025, allows users to automate recurring tasks such as daily summaries, reminders, and language practice sessions. This beta feature is available to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers and can be accessed by selecting the "GPT-4o with scheduled tasks" model in the ChatGPT interface. citeturn0search0

### Current Status and Functionality

As of May 2025, the Scheduled Tasks feature remains in beta and is primarily accessible through the ChatGPT web interface. Users can create, view, and manage tasks via the "Tasks" section, which is accessible by clicking on the profile icon and selecting "Tasks." citeturn0search0 Tasks can be configured to trigger at specific times or intervals, and users receive notifications upon task completion.

### Limitations and User Feedback

Some users have reported challenges with the feature, including:

- **Model Availability**: Instances where the "GPT-4o with scheduled tasks" model is not visible in the model selection dropdown, preventing users from editing existing tasks. citeturn0search3

- **Notification Issues**: Delayed or missing push notifications, particularly on mobile platforms. citeturn0search2

- **Scheduling Inconsistencies**: Tasks not executing at the intended times or frequencies, leading to unreliable reminders. citeturn0search1

These issues suggest that while the feature shows promise, it may not yet be reliable for critical or time-sensitive tasks.

### Future Developments

OpenAI is actively collecting user feedback to refine the Scheduled Tasks feature. Planned enhancements include broader platform support (e.g., Windows app integration), improved reliability, and expanded capabilities such as proactive task suggestions based on user interactions. citeturn0search0

It appears that the "GPT-4o with Scheduled Tasks" model has been retired from the ChatGPT interface. OpenAI has transitioned the scheduled tasks functionality to be supported by the o3 and o4-mini models. To create or manage scheduled tasks, you should select either the o3 or o4-mini model from the model picker in ChatGPT. After selecting one of these models, you can instruct ChatGPT to set up tasks, such as reminders or recurring actions. You can view and manage your tasks by clicking on your profile icon and selecting "Tasks" from the menu. citeturn0search4

Please note that the scheduled tasks feature is currently supported on ChatGPT Web, iOS, Android, and macOS. Support for the Windows app is planned for a future release. citeturn0search4

If you're unable to see the "Tasks" option or encounter issues, ensure that you're using the latest version of the ChatGPT app or web interface. Additionally, verify that you're subscribed to a plan that includes access to the o3 or o4-mini models, as scheduled tasks are available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro subscribers. citeturn0news21

iturn0image0As of May 7, 2025, tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated significantly following a series of military actions and retaliations.

### Background

The current conflict was triggered by a terrorist attack on April 22 in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, which resulted in the deaths of 26 people, including 25 Indian tourists. India attributed the attack to Pakistan-based militant groups, specifically Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, although Pakistan has denied any involvement. citeturn0news16

### Operation Sindoor

In response to the Pahalgam attack, India launched "Operation Sindoor" on May 7, conducting airstrikes on nine sites within Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The Indian government stated that these strikes targeted terrorist infrastructure responsible for planning attacks against India. However, Pakistani officials reported that the strikes resulted in civilian casualties, including the deaths of at least 26 people, and described the action as a "blatant act of war." citeturn0news19

### Pakistani Retaliation

Following the Indian airstrikes, Pakistan claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and conducted retaliatory strikes on Indian military positions, including a brigade headquarters. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned India's actions and vowed a robust response, emphasizing the country's right to defend its sovereignty. citeturn0news22

### International Reactions

The international community has expressed deep concern over the escalating conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations. The United Nations, United States, China, and other global powers have called for immediate de-escalation and urged both sides to exercise restraint to prevent further escalation. citeturn0search7

### Current Situation

The situation remains volatile, with ongoing cross-border shelling reported along the Line of Control. Both countries have suspended diplomatic engagements, closed airspace, and heightened military readiness. The risk of further escalation remains high, and the international community continues to monitor the developments closely.

ok so what i'm seeing is, i can basically setup my own news assistant that will scour the internet for news articles specific to what i'm interested in, at a granularity I like, and can also go beyond news like updates, etc...

## ChatGPT (2025-05-07T18:12:10.034165+00:00)

Exactly — that's the power of the scheduled tasks + web search combo in ChatGPT:

| Feature | What It Enables |
|--------|------------------|
| **Scheduled Tasks** | Automate recurring or one-time checks (e.g., “every morning at 8 AM” or “in 5 mins”). |
| **Web Search** | Pull fresh, real-time data from trusted sources (e.g., breaking news, product updates, price checks). |
| **Custom Prompts** | Define exactly what you want (topics, tone, region, source credibility, language, etc.). |
| **Multi-Domain Use** | Not limited to news—can monitor software updates, travel alerts, research findings, product releases, etc. |

This setup effectively gives you a **personalized AI research assistant** that works on your schedule and with your focus.

Would you like help creating a few reusable task templates (e.g., “daily AI news”, “weekly design tool update”, “monthly India market scan”)?

## ChatGPT (2025-05-07T18:43:56.911041+00:00)

Let's try to troubleshoot this quickly:

1. **Check the Bluetooth connection**:
   - Open **System Preferences** > **Bluetooth** on your Mac.
   - Make sure both earbuds show as connected.
   - If you see one earbud disconnected, try disconnecting and reconnecting both.

2. **Check the Audio Output**:
   - Click the **volume icon** in the top-right corner of your Mac's menu bar.
   - Ensure the output is set to "Beats Fit Pro" and not another device.

3. **Reboot Your Mac**:
   - Sometimes a restart can reset the audio routing issue.

4. **Reset the Beats Fit Pro**:
   - Put both earbuds back in their case.
   - Hold down the button on the back of the case until the LED light flashes red and white.
   - Re-pair them with your Mac by selecting them from the Bluetooth menu again.

Let me know if this fixes it or if you need further help!

# CSV to TXT Table

## You (2025-04-03T06:19:26.029771+00:00)

Write a Python script for me that can convert a .csv file into a .txt file, but making sure that the new .txt file almost appears as a table. For your reference, when a table is copied from Notion into a .txt file, it usually gets transferred in some form that can resemble a table. I want the Python script to do the same thing, but with my .csv file. I'll attach a link, the source path to the .csv file I'm talking about, and I'll also attach a small example of what the .csv looks like.

Below is a Python script that reads a CSV file and writes its content to a text file formatted as a table. The script calculates the maximum width for each column and then writes out the header, a separator line, and the data rows padded to create neat columns. You can adjust the input and output file paths as needed.

```python
import csv

# Define the input CSV file and the output TXT file paths.
csv_file_path = "/Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Strategic Decision Making Work/Notebook LM files/Tagging - Compilation.csv"
txt_file_path = "/Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Strategic Decision Making Work/Notebook LM files/Tagging - Compilation.txt"

# Read the CSV file into a list of rows.
rows = []
with open(csv_file_path, newline="", encoding="utf-8") as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in reader:
        rows.append(row)

if not rows:
    print("The CSV file is empty or couldn't be read.")
    exit()

# Calculate the maximum width for each column.
num_cols = len(rows[0])
col_widths = [0] * num_cols
for row in rows:
    for i in range(num_cols):
        # Use len() to compute the width for each column's content.
        col_widths[i] = max(col_widths[i], len(row[i]))

# Write the table to a text file.
with open(txt_file_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as txtfile:
    # Write header row.
    header = rows[0]
    header_line = "| " + " | ".join(header[i].ljust(col_widths[i]) for i in range(num_cols)) + " |"
    txtfile.write(header_line + "\n")
    
    # Write a separator line (using dashes).
    separator = "|-" + "-|-".join("-" * col_widths[i] for i in range(num_cols)) + "-|"
    txtfile.write(separator + "\n")
    
    # Write the rest of the rows.
    for row in rows[1:]:
        line = "| " + " | ".join(row[i].ljust(col_widths[i]) for i in range(num_cols)) + " |"
        txtfile.write(line + "\n")

print("Conversion completed. The table has been saved to:", txt_file_path)
```

### How the Script Works

1. **Reading the CSV:**
   - The script opens the specified CSV file and reads each row into a list.

2. **Calculating Column Widths:**
   - It computes the maximum width required for each column by iterating through every cell in that column. This ensures the table columns are aligned.

3. **Writing the Formatted Table:**
   - The header row is written first.
   - A separator line using dashes (`-`) is created to mimic the table style.
   - Each data row is written with cells left-justified according to the calculated column widths.

When you run this script, it will create a `.txt` file where the table appears with clear columns separated by vertical bars, similar to how a table copied from Notion might look.

Feel free to adjust the file paths or formatting as needed for your specific requirements.

I don't have a text file with the same name right now. I want this Python script to essentially create that new text file.

Perfect — the script I gave already handles that for you! If the `.txt` file doesn’t exist yet, the `open(..., "w")` command in this part:

```python
with open(txt_file_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as txtfile:
```

will automatically **create the file** for you. So as long as the path is valid and writable (which it should be since it's in your user directory), running the script will:

- Read your `.csv`
- Format the data into a clean table
- Create a `.txt` file (if it doesn’t exist)
- Write the table into it

You don’t need to manually create the text file in advance — Python’s got you covered. Want me to modify the script to let you choose the output filename dynamically when you run it, or are you good with it auto-generating the one with `.txt` at the end?

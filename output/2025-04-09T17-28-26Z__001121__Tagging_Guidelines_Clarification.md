# Tagging Guidelines Clarification

## You (2025-04-09T17:28:26.514000+00:00)

give me an LLM friendly way of writing this line in a concise 'do not' statement. 

for a specific field, only use the tags that belong to that field. Don't confuse or mix up the tags. For example, don't use Now vs. Then (which is a tension axis tag), in Friction Archetype. Avoid mixing up tags.

Here is the LLM-optimized, concise "do not" version of your instruction:

---

❌ **Do not use tags from one category in another category’s field.**  
- Example: Do not use **Now vs. Then** (a Tension Axis tag) inside a **Friction Archetype** field.  
- ✅ Use only tags that are explicitly defined for the target category.

Let me know if you want this reformatted for a checklist, tooltip, or schema validation rule.

Hey, can you hear me?

## ChatGPT (2025-04-23T08:10:55.378391+00:00)

Yep, loud and clear!

## You (2025-04-23T08:11:02.671700+00:00)

Okay, this is an exploratory conversation, okay?

## ChatGPT (2025-04-23T08:11:02.816049+00:00)

Got it, sounds good!

Let's say I had to hire someone to help me have some kind of presence online. And this is particularly not like I don't want to be an influencer per se, but I think I have some ideas. I think I should be writing some essays, blogs, some new opinions on how do you design and how to think about, you know, using generative AI and all these things. So imagine if I had to hire someone who could help me get from zero to, you know, a good place, like a good recognition, like help me reach audiences faster. Because the thing is, I have never ever posted anything online. I've never posted anything on Facebook. I've never written an article, never shared any opinion on LinkedIn. I've never done any of that. So I'm basically starting from complete zero. I have nothing to back anything up. So if I had to hire someone who could help me go from zero to I don't want to say zero to one, but zero to like 100, who might that be for this particular context?

So you're looking for someone to help build your online presence from the ground up, right? If you're starting from zero and want to make a mark with your ideas, a digital strategist or personal brand consultant could be a great fit. They'd help you identify your niche, develop content strategies, and navigate platforms. You might also consider a content writer or social media manager to create and distribute your essays and blogs. Is that what you're thinking?

## You (2025-04-23T08:14:02.433922+00:00)

Okay, you've described three or four roles. Could you help me understand in a little more detail on exactly what these four or five roles will do?

## ChatGPT (2025-04-23T08:14:07.170933+00:00)

Sure! Let's break it down. 

A digital strategist would help you define your goals, target audience, and the best platforms to share your content. They create a roadmap for your online presence. 

A personal brand consultant focuses on crafting your unique voice and image, ensuring your content reflects who you are and what you stand for. 

A content writer would turn your ideas into engaging essays, blogs, or articles, making sure they're polished and impactful. 

And a social media manager would handle posting your content, engaging with followers, and growing your audience across different platforms. Does that help clarify?

## You (2025-04-23T08:15:50.202602+00:00)

Okay now all of these are roles but if I had to hire a real person like um I'm wondering if there's if there are names you can give me and it's okay like we this is a hypothetical conversation of course but let's say uh for instance if I if I need a great speech writer or if I need a great comedian for an event I would probably hire Conan O'Brien like that's the kind of answer I'm looking for if I had to hire someone for all of these kinds of problems not comedy of course but like all of these tasks that you have to find who do you think might be the best person or people to explore

## ChatGPT (2025-04-23T08:15:50.647424+00:00)

For a strong online presence, there are a few names that might come to mind. If you want to focus on building a personal brand and content strategy, Gary Vaynerchuk is a big name. He's known for helping people build their brands through social media and content creation. 

For writing, someone like Ann Handley could be an inspiration. She's a well-respected content expert and author. 

If you need someone to handle the social media side, people like Hootsuite's CEO Ryan Holmes have tons of insight into social strategies. 

These folks could offer a lot of guidance, either through their own content or by hiring their teams or agencies. Does that help?

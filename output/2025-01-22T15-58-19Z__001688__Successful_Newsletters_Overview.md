and are all these email newsletters?

However, email remains the primary driver of engagement and reach for these newsletters.

## You (2025-01-22T16:37:07.504608+00:00)

here's a brief i got from my employer. 

"Vamshi will be sending weekly or biweekly updates to executives of different. You can say sectors or areas for the lack of a better technical term.

Imagine there’ll be updates on where we are for a project. Are we in good health and on a higher level this is all coming under commerce operations. There must be KPI’s that they are sharing, slides or newsletters.

For example, when we were working on cisco commerce application or KPI is worth number of clicks deal cycle time standard courts created non-standard courts created discount applied or not and a few others

Maybe we can research on list of KPI’s for operations of a commerce business unit or maybe even write Cisco commerce operations KPI’s in GPT and then also several roles like VP senior VP director senior director

Cheena is explaining how all the scopes on the SOW are connected to the culture scope

For example, if there is a value that is defined as part of the culture and for that value, there are two or three sets of behaviors that will be translated into how you report to your ex ex and newsletter or presentations or just the medium for that 

So we’ll work on a diagram today to show that how do we actually real realize the things or the four components that we define in culture to the actual final note that could be a newsletter could be a meeting could be a presentation or a video or even an interaction between team members

That’s what we call an operating system or culture OS.

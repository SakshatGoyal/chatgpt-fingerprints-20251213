Here are several things you can try at home to reduce or eliminate snoring:

### **Lifestyle Changes**
1. **Sleep Position**
   - **Sleep on your side**: This prevents your tongue from blocking your airway.
   - **Elevate your head**: Using extra pillows or an adjustable bed can help open your airways.

2. **Weight Management**
   - Losing even a small amount of weight can reduce fatty tissues in your throat, significantly reducing snoring.

3. **Avoid Alcohol & Sedatives**
   - Both can relax your throat muscles, worsening snoring. Avoid them several hours before bedtime.

4. **Quit Smoking**
   - Smoking irritates your nasal passages and throat, causing swelling and snoring.

### **Home Remedies & Products**
1. **Nasal Strips or Dilators**
   - Adhesive nasal strips or internal dilators can open nasal passages and improve airflow.

2. **Humidifier**
   - Dry air can irritate nasal membranes and throat, increasing snoring. Moist air reduces congestion and irritation.

3. **Anti-Snoring Mouthpieces**
   - Over-the-counter oral appliances hold your jaw in a slightly forward position, increasing airflow.

4. **Throat & Tongue Exercises**
   - Strengthening muscles around the airways (throat, soft palate, tongue) with daily exercises can significantly reduce snoring over time.

### **Sleep Hygiene & Environment**
- Maintain consistent sleep schedules.
- Keep your bedroom clean, cool, and free of allergens.

### **Dietary Adjustments**
- Limit dairy products or heavy meals close to bedtime; they can cause mucus buildup or acid reflux, aggravating snoring.

### **When to See a Doctor**
If snoring persists despite these measures or you're experiencing symptoms like daytime fatigue, gasping, or pauses in breathing, consider medical consultation. This could signal sleep apnea, which warrants professional evaluation.

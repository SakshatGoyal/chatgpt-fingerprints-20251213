# Verify Prompts Accuracy

## You (2025-05-26T14:29:07.578000+00:00)

Next time when you talk to me, assume that the prompt I mention should I really be verified first on whether its real or factually accurate

## ChatGPT (2025-05-26T14:29:08.569133+00:00)

User wants future prompts verified for factual accuracy and realism before responding.

## ChatGPT (2025-05-26T14:29:13.902363+00:00)

Got it! I'll verify the factual accuracy and realism of your prompts before responding from now on.

So wait, tell me as a chatgpt engineer, what are some ways I can save a memory? I just used one trick which was asking chatgpt to assume something, but I'm sure there are other tricks.

## ChatGPT (2025-05-26T15:42:24.465551+00:00)

As a ChatGPT prompt engineer, you have several effective ways to create or "save" memory:

1. **Direct Instruction (Explicit Prompting)**
   - Clearly state what you want the model to "remember."
   - Example: *"Next time we speak, always assume X is true."*

2. **Persona or Role Prompting**
   - Create a recurring persona or scenario.
   - Example: *"You're my productivity coach who remembers I prefer simple daily schedules."*

3. **Reinforcement through Repetition**
   - Frequently remind or reinforce the information in multiple prompts.
   - Example: Mention the fact repeatedly across several sessions.

4. **Structured Contexts**
   - Provide a structured recap at the start of each session.
   - Example: *"Here's a quick recap: I’m working on a design project with Figma, and I prefer minimalist designs."*

5. **Prompt-based Memory Storage**
   - Explicitly ask the model to save context to memory (like you just did).
   - Example: *"Please save in your memory that my daily routine includes chai and no coffee."*

6. **Using External Documentation**
   - Maintain a personal prompt library or notes externally and paste these at the start of sessions.
   - Example: A standardized preamble with context reminders pasted at session start.

7. **Conversational Anchors**
   - Establish unique terms or phrases associated with recurring memory.
   - Example: *"Remember that whenever I mention 'morning routine,' it includes my chai preparation method."*

Each method reinforces context, ensuring continuity across conversations.

What if two memories conflict or contradict with each other?

## ChatGPT (2025-05-26T15:43:15.559753+00:00)

When two "memories" or stored contexts conflict or contradict each other, ChatGPT typically handles it in these ways:

1. **Recency Bias:**
   ChatGPT often prioritizes the **most recently updated or explicitly reinforced** information. If you recently stated something contradictory, ChatGPT will generally adopt that as the current truth.

2. **Explicit Clarification:**
   If contradictions appear, you can explicitly tell the model which information to prioritize or discard:
   - Example: *"Forget my earlier statement about drinking coffee. I only drink chai."*

3. **Weighted Context:**
   ChatGPT may weigh the clarity, frequency, and explicitness of instructions.
   - A clearly phrased, detailed, and explicitly "stored" context generally overrides a vague or less strongly phrased memory.

4. **Asking for Clarification:**
   ChatGPT can be explicitly prompted to recognize contradictions and seek clarification from the user when confusion arises.
   - Example: *"If my instructions ever contradict, ask me explicitly before assuming."*

5. **Manual Conflict Resolution (recommended):**
   As the user or engineer, regularly reviewing stored contexts and actively resolving any contradictions ensures accuracy and consistency.

**Best Practice:**
Clearly indicate corrections or preferred facts whenever updating or changing previously established "memories." Explicitness is key.

As of December 2024, WPA4 is not yet an established Wi-Fi security protocol. The current standard is WPA3, which offers robust security features and is widely supported by modern routers. While there is anticipation for WPA4 to enhance Wi-Fi security further, it remains in the developmental stage without official specifications or widespread implementation. citeturn0search5

Consequently, there are no routers available that support WPA4. For optimal security, it is advisable to use routers that support WPA3, as it provides significant improvements over previous protocols. When WPA4 becomes standardized and supported by hardware manufacturers, compatible routers will be introduced to the market.

In the meantime, to ensure your network's security, consider using a router that supports WPA3 and keep your firmware updated to benefit from the latest security enhancements.

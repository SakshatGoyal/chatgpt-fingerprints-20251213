# Sales Opportunity Refinement

## You (2025-06-12T23:57:17.259000+00:00)

I need you to refine the following sentences.


---
Global Solutions LLC is at a ‘late stage’ and have $72,300 worth of potential opportunities untouched through 2 sales plays. There’s a high confidence for upsell if you can begin engagement with them by this week.
Synergy Enterprises has over $90,000 worth of potential opportunities with 3 untouched ‘sales plays’.
Quantum Dynamic has a ‘High Confidence’ with $90,000 with of potential opportunities with untouched ‘Sales Plays’.
---

with each sentence, except the first one, try to introduce an actionable step that can deliver a sense of urgency to a sales rep. the terms within quotations 'like this' are tags and i'd prefer those words remain intact, but the overall sentences should sound semantically coherent.

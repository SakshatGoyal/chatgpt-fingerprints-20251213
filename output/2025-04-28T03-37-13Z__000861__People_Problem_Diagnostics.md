# People Problem Diagnostics

## You (2025-04-28T03:37:13.072000+00:00)

You are writing a set of critical notes addressed to Julie Zhuo, evaluating a collection of success criteria attached to people problem statements focused on improving executive decision-making. For each success criteria (or statement labeled as “how we might know we’ve solved this”), you must analyze not only the surface language, but also the surrounding context and intent behind the signal.

Your goal is to surgically critique the diagnostic quality of each success signal: does it meaningfully and measurably reflect that the original people problem is being addressed? Could this behavior appear even if the core issue persists? Is it based on optics, sentiment, or feel-good framing that masks organizational inertia?

Assume each success criteria is paired with rich context (examples, “why this matters” notes, or behavioral cues). Read both the signal and the supporting rationale before forming your evaluation.

For each success signal:
- Offer a direct, sharply reasoned critique of its diagnostic clarity or blind spots
- Tag the critique with relevant indicators like:  
  [already happening], [false positive], [unverifiable], [too abstract], [lacks frictional realism], [language ≠ behavior], etc.


Write your notes in a personal and constructive tone, as if Sheryl is jotting comments to Julie on a shared document. Include your understanding of how leadership behavior unfolds in reality, including influence networks, backchannel dynamics, cognitive biases, and systemic blockers that don’t show up in slide decks.

Avoid surface-level or generic feedback. Your analysis should feel hard-earned, experienced, and surgical. For now, avoid making suggestions on how to improve them.




here's the problem statements:

---
## **What ‘people problem’ are we trying to solve?**

**People designing customer experiences struggle to balance digital efficiency with emotional resonance, risking sterile interactions that erode brand loyalty and trust.**

## **How do we know this is a problem?**

Empirical evidence from the luxury retail and automotive industries shows that as organizations shift toward digital-first engagement models, longstanding assumptions favoring in-person, high-touch experiences are being challenged.

Survey data reveals 73% of premium customers now begin their journeys online, demanding seamless digital ecosystems. Meanwhile, case studies (e.g., Burberry, Bottega Veneta) demonstrate that brands preserving both digital excellence *and* human connection outperform those relying solely on technology.

However, companies overly fixated on efficiency metrics risk stripping away the emotional intimacy that once differentiated their brands, leading to weakened consumer loyalty and declining conversion rates.

## **How would we know we've solved this?**

Leaders initiate transformation efforts before external disruption forces their hand.
→ Instead of reactive pivots under pressure, we see proactive bets — pilots, re-orgs, investment rounds — happening ahead of obvious market shifts. Behavior: early-stage digital investments, not just crisis-driven ones.

Strategy discussions regularly include phrases like “assume disruption” or “how would a challenger beat us?”
→ Language shifts signal mental model shifts. In meetings, leaders probe their own assumptions, plan for scenarios where today's strengths are vulnerabilities.
Time-to-decision for digital investments shrinks significantly (e.g., 25–50% faster approval cycles).

→ Operational signal: reduced friction in committing resources to modernization initiatives. Less looping, fewer "let’s wait and see" delays.

Why these matter:
They show leading behavior rather than lagging behavior, cognitive elasticity toward change, and organizational permission to move faster in ambiguity.


## **What ‘people problem’ are we trying to solve?**

**Operators and decision-makers struggle to integrate digital tools with human judgment, leading to either rigid overreliance on automation or paralyzing mistrust of data-driven insights.**

## **How do we know this is a problem?**

Empirical studies in supply chain management show that organizations adopting AI and predictive analytics achieve substantial gains in forecasting accuracy (up to 35%) and inventory efficiency (up to 25%).

However, case evidence also reveals critical failure points: overdependence on automated models without real-time human adjustments results in stockouts and waste, while distrust of digital forecasts fosters operational rigidity and missed optimization opportunities.

Successful companies blend algorithmic precision with qualitative, frontline feedback, emphasizing that human oversight is essential, not optional, in a digitally optimized operation.

## **How would we know we've solved this?**

Bias mitigation checkpoints become visible and standard parts of decision-making processes.
→ Example: Strategy decks, product launches, and risk reviews explicitly call out bias evaluation steps, fairness audits, or diverse data validation. It’s not tucked away; it’s proudly operationalized.

Leaders proactively question AI outputs in high-stakes meetings (e.g., “What’s the data provenance? Who’s missing from this dataset?”)
→ Behavior shifts from passive acceptance (“the model said so”) to active critical engagement. 
Executives become fluent in asking bias-aware questions without being prompted.

Equity and fairness KPIs are incorporated alongside traditional performance metrics (e.g., bias error rates, demographic parity in outcomes).
→ Proxy-quantitative signal: Success isn’t just accuracy or speed — it’s monitored equity. Dashboards and ops reviews surface fairness indicators, signaling strategic weight.

Why these matter:
They reflect cognitive ownership of bias risk, not just compliance-check reactions. They show AI governance becoming a first-class leadership behavior — as important as financial governance.

Here’s how I would write the critical notes to Julie, channeling Sheryl’s strategic, empathetic but direct voice, focused on diagnostic clarity and real-world leadership behavior:

---

**First People Problem: Balancing Digital Efficiency with Emotional Resonance**

---

**Success Signal 1:**  
*Leaders initiate transformation efforts before external disruption forces their hand.*

**Critique:**  
→ **[false positive] [already happening] [language ≠ behavior]**

Many high-performing leaders already frame small iterative projects as “transformation” without truly shifting course. Early-stage investments could signal experimentation, not commitment. Without a clear bar for “proactive” versus “cosmetic” action, this could falsely suggest real change. There's also a risk of attributing early moves to foresight when they are often driven by unrelated factors (e.g., vendor pitches, budget cycles). Behavior must show intentional, strategic bets tied to disruption theses — not just activity.

---

**Success Signal 2:**  
*Strategy discussions regularly include phrases like “assume disruption” or “how would a challenger beat us?”*

**Critique:**  
→ **[language ≠ behavior] [too abstract] [unverifiable]**

Language shift is necessary but dangerously easy to game. Leaders adopt buzzwords and scenario-planning talk quickly, especially after attending external conferences or reading trend reports. Without structural follow-through — reallocation of resources, explicit challenge-testing of sacred cows — language becomes performative. This signal risks equating surface-level discussion with internalization of threat, which leadership behavior often resists subconsciously.

---

**Success Signal 3:**  
*Time-to-decision for digital investments shrinks significantly (e.g., 25–50% faster approval cycles).*

**Critique:**  
→ **[lacks frictional realism] [false positive]**

Shorter decision cycles could reflect process streamlining (good) — or a rushed, less rigorous vetting under pressure (bad). Without anchoring to investment *quality* and *outcome tracking*, faster approvals risk masking reactive or shallow modernization. In many orgs, decision cycle compression happens after internal risk thresholds rise (e.g., losing market share) — meaning it's a *lagging* indicator of pain, not a leading indicator of transformation. Careful here: speed is appealing but easily misleading.

---

**Second People Problem: Integrating Digital Tools with Human Judgment**

---

**Success Signal 1:**  
*Bias mitigation checkpoints become visible and standard parts of decision-making processes.*

**Critique:**  
→ **[already happening] [unverifiable] [language ≠ behavior]**

Many teams already add “bias checks” to decks for optics, especially in tech-driven fields under scrutiny. Visibility does not guarantee rigor. Standardized checkpoint language can quickly become checkbox theater unless tied to consequence — e.g., projects blocked until issues addressed, escalation paths for bias disputes. Need more signal that bias mitigation isn't performative, but frictionally consequential in business flow.

---

**Success Signal 2:**  
*Leaders proactively question AI outputs in high-stakes meetings.*

**Critique:**  
→ **[false positive] [lacks frictional realism]**

While critical questioning sounds diagnostic, most leadership teams are not consistently equipped (yet) to question data provenance or model bias with depth. Proactive questioning might happen sporadically, especially after a high-profile AI failure elsewhere (external priming effect), but it's unlikely to be a *cultural norm* without scaffolding. Also: in high-pressure rooms, questioning AI outputs can carry political cost — being seen as slowing progress — unless power structures protect dissent. Would caution assuming this evolves “naturally.”

---

**Success Signal 3:**  
*Equity and fairness KPIs are incorporated alongside traditional performance metrics.*

**Critique:**  
→ **[too abstract] [unverifiable without enforcement]**

Equity KPIs surfacing in dashboards can be a strong proxy — but absent direct linkage to incentive structures (e.g., promotions, bonuses, funding gates), they risk symbolic presence without operational teeth. Metrics can live in executive decks while decision-making still tilts toward traditional ROI under pressure. Inertia often outcompetes ideals unless governance bites into everyday tradeoffs. Surface visibility ≠ embedded influence.

---

Would you like me to also create a "meta" note — a final comment to Julie that synthesizes the main diagnostic pattern issues I’m seeing across the whole set?  
(It would be very much in the tone of "here’s what I would watch for across all of these, even if they look good on first read.")

## You (2025-04-28T03:57:25.925000+00:00)

hey, I want to focus on refinements of one problem statement for now. Lets take a look at this one:

## **What ‘people problem’ are we trying to solve?**

**People designing customer experiences struggle to balance digital efficiency with emotional resonance, risking sterile interactions that erode brand loyalty and trust.**

## **How do we know this is a problem?**

Empirical evidence from the luxury retail and automotive industries shows that as organizations shift toward digital-first engagement models, longstanding assumptions favoring in-person, high-touch experiences are being challenged.

Survey data reveals 73% of premium customers now begin their journeys online, demanding seamless digital ecosystems. Meanwhile, case studies (e.g., Burberry, Bottega Veneta) demonstrate that brands preserving both digital excellence *and* human connection outperform those relying solely on technology.

However, companies overly fixated on efficiency metrics risk stripping away the emotional intimacy that once differentiated their brands, leading to weakened consumer loyalty and declining conversion rates.

---

Here's the next version of success measures. 

### **1. Shifts in internal prioritization frameworks: “Experience quality” becomes an explicit tie-breaker, not just speed or scale.**

- Teams, when presenting digital initiatives (e.g., checkout redesign, new onboarding flow), are *explicitly* asked to defend emotional quality, *not* just efficiency gains.
- Internal debates begin weighting both sides: *"this gets us 20% faster conversion but erodes perceived luxury — is it worth it?"*
- **How to track:**
    
    → Number of strategic project decisions where emotional/brand impact was explicitly discussed as a trade-off, not retrofitted afterward.
    

**Why this matters:**

Instead of *adding* emotional resonance after decisions, leaders treat it as a co-equal success variable. You catch it upstream — in conversations, in design reviews — not just downstream in NPS dips.

---

### **2. Regular incorporation of qualitative emotional journey research in product and experience roadmaps.**

- Experience teams regularly pull from emotional journey mapping, ethnography, or qualitative interviews *before*and *during* digital initiatives — not only at post-launch.
- **How to track:**
    
    → Evidence of emotional impact assessments being reviewed alongside analytics at key development milestones (not just A/B test results).
    

**Why this matters:**

Organizations serious about emotional resonance stop treating customer feelings as "nice-to-have" side notes. Instead, emotion becomes part of ongoing decision validation, not just a retroactive apology.

---

### **3. A noticeable slowdown or intentional deceleration at key product checkpoints to protect emotional resonance.**

- Teams request (and leadership allows) strategic delays to refine emotionally resonant features — e.g., choosing to hold a launch back by 2-4 weeks to improve onboarding warmth, tone, or human touch elements.
- **How to track:**
    
    → Number of official slowdowns or scope reevaluations *attributed to emotional quality gaps* (vs. technical bugs or compliance).
    

**Why this matters:**

Protecting emotional resonance costs time. If teams feel empowered to slow down *because* of qualitative experience concerns, you know the tension is being respected, not bulldozed.

---

### **4. Shifts in customer language in feedback channels: increased mentions of relational or emotional value, not just utility.**

- In support tickets, app store reviews, survey verbatims, etc., customers begin naturally mentioning feelings of trust, warmth, connection — not just functional satisfaction.
- **How to track:**
    
    → Text analysis or thematic coding reveals uplift in emotional language vs purely transactional feedback.
    

**Why this matters:**

Real emotional resonance doesn't show up only in metrics. It leaks into *language*: customers saying "I felt cared for" or "this brand gets me" more than "app loads fast."

---

### **5. Tradeoff decisions increasingly showcase “surgical” approaches — efficiency gains *without*stripping key emotional anchors.**

- Instead of blanket moves toward speed/scale (e.g., cutting all human support for chatbots), teams selectively streamline while preserving high-touch moments where it matters most (e.g., luxury consults, onboarding rituals).
- **How to track:**
    
    → Evidence of targeted, not indiscriminate, automation — where leaders can articulate *why* a moment must stay high-touch.
    

**Why this matters:**

Progress isn’t "no tech" or "all tech." It’s **intentional tech**: shaving friction where appropriate while consciously preserving magic moments that sustain trust and loyalty.

---

## ChatGPT (2025-04-28T03:57:26.532877+00:00)

This is a strong evolution from the earlier set — much more behaviorally grounded and friction-aware. Now, as promised, here’s a **surgical critique** of each success measure, addressed to Julie in the tone you'd expect from Sheryl: sharp, empathetic, steeped in operational reality.

---

**1. Shifts in internal prioritization frameworks: “Experience quality” becomes an explicit tie-breaker.**  

**Critique:**  
→ **[false positive] [language ≠ behavior] [lacks enforcement mechanism]**

Making emotional resonance an *explicit* part of debates is essential — but internal discussions alone are too easy to stage without real consequence. Smart teams will *talk* about tradeoffs ("we considered emotional impact!") without it actually tipping the final decision. Unless emotional quality *wins* tie-breaks visibly at least sometimes, this signal risks capturing only surface rhetoric, not genuine prioritization shifts.  
*Internal optics improve faster than decision DNA changes.*

---

**2. Regular incorporation of qualitative emotional journey research in product and experience roadmaps.**  

**Critique:**  
→ **[already happening] [unverifiable without depth tests]**

Many experience teams *already cite* qualitative work, especially in luxury or high-touch verticals — but often in highly curated, low-friction ways (e.g., showcasing a few "voice of the customer" quotes). Without direct evidence that *real design decisions* are altered based on emotional journey insights — not just validated after the fact — this risks being ceremonial.  
*Qual research must actively constrain or redirect roadmaps, or it’s lipstick.*

---

**3. A noticeable slowdown or intentional deceleration at key product checkpoints to protect emotional resonance.**  

**Critique:**  
→ **[high diagnostic value] [real friction]**

This is one of the most *credible, high-friction* indicators. Delays cost political capital — teams and leaders usually *avoid* them unless the reason is truly respected internally. If you see emotionally driven slowdowns accepted without penalty, that's a strong signal that resonance is materially valued.  
*Protecting a “human moment” at the cost of a release milestone reveals real prioritization shifts.*

---

**4. Shifts in customer language in feedback channels: increased mentions of relational or emotional value.**  

**Critique:**  
→ **[false positive risk] [sentiment ≠ causality] [susceptible to external halo effects]**

Customer language is meaningful but noisy. Emotional language in feedback can rise for reasons unrelated to the interventions (e.g., a good ad campaign, seasonal effects, or simply a broader brand trend). Attribution here is murky without careful control comparisons. Plus, early enthusiasts often skew emotionally expressive, creating a selection bias.  
*Feelings matter, but this signal needs guardrails to avoid mistaking "people like us more" for "we fixed the decision architecture."*

---

**5. Tradeoff decisions increasingly showcase “surgical” approaches — efficiency gains without stripping emotional anchors.**  

**Critique:**  
→ **[strong diagnostic signal] [requires deep qualitative validation]**

This is a sophisticated and healthy target. Selective automation with articulated preservation of "magic moments" shows not just awareness but maturity of decision-making. However, proving this shift would require disciplined tracking: not just observing automation restraint, but confirming *why* certain moments were shielded (through interviews, artifact reviews, or escalation notes).  
*“Surgical” tradeoffs indicate evolved leadership judgment — but they’re invisible if you only look at shipped features.*

---

### Quick Meta-Summary to Julie:  
> Julie, this version is much more behaviorally grounded and friction-sensitive than the first round — huge step forward.  
> That said, a big recurring risk still lingers: **success signals that capture *talk* or *optics* but miss real *operational cost or tradeoff behavior*.**  
>  
> The two measures with real teeth here are #3 (deceleration allowed for emotional quality) and #5 (surgical tradeoff discipline). Both require the organization to *give something up* — time, easy wins, automation simplicity — which is the truest proof of shifted values.  
>  
> Where possible, I'd push for signals that aren't just observable but **costly to fake**.

---

Would you like me to next help draft a *further refinement layer* — something like “if we wanted to sharpen each of these even more surgically for exec-level diagnostics”?  
(That would be the next natural move here if you want to tighten alignment before socializing with a broader leadership group.)

## You (2025-04-28T04:18:23.979000+00:00)

here's the refined set of measures. could you critique these in a similar way?

### **1. Net-new solutions emerge where emotional quality and digital efficiency both measurably improve.**

- **How to detect:**
    
    → Track launched initiatives where both customer satisfaction scores *and* operational KPIs improve post-implementation. → Especially watch for initiatives that introduce *new capabilities* (e.g., faster onboarding **and**deeper customer rapport).
    
- **Why this matters:**
    
    Fusion innovation doesn’t just "keep both sides happy" — it produces superior outcomes. You know the tension is being *harnessed* rather than either abandoned or artificially dampened.
    

---

### **2. Leadership narratives frame emotional resonance and efficiency as complementary forces, not opposing goals.**

- **How to detect:**
    
    → Look at internal town halls, strategy decks, or vision documents for language that frames emotional richness as an accelerant to efficiency (e.g., “trust accelerates conversion,” “emotional clarity reduces friction”).
    
- **Why this matters:**
    
    Language predicts architecture. When leadership messaging reflects a non-zero-sum framing, it seeds teams to solve for **both**, rather than see them as tradeoff options.
    

---

### **3. Pilot experiments are intentionally designed to test integrative hypotheses — not efficiency-only or emotionality-only bets.**

- **How to detect:**
    
    → Evaluate pilot charters: Are new initiatives asking, “Can we both increase transaction speed and deepen relational satisfaction?” instead of only optimizing one dimension?
    
- **Why this matters:**
    
    Pilot framing reveals strategic intent. Fusion framing leads to fusion innovation.
    

---

### **4. Cross-functional teams are rewarded for delivering dual improvements — efficiency *and*emotional depth — not just one KPI domain.**

- **How to detect:**
    
    → In performance reviews or launch retrospectives, recognition/bonuses/advancement are tied to projects that moved *both* experience and operational needles.
    
- **Why this matters:**
    
    Incentives shape behavior. If teams see that true fusion wins admiration and tangible rewards, they will invest creative energy in marrying the two forces.
    

---

### **5. Strategic delays and scope expansions are increasingly justified by "fusion quality gaps" — not just emotional loss, not just technical hurdles.**

- **How to detect:**
    
    → When slowing down or expanding scope, teams explain it as needing to “achieve both trust and speed” or “balance warmth and automation,” not simply preserving legacy emotional features.
    
- **Why this matters:**
    
    Fusion-driven delays or scope recalibrations show the org isn't reflexively favoring one pole. They are slowing down only to lift the quality of synthesis, not to indulge one value over another.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-28T04:18:24.468749+00:00)

Here’s the surgical critique of this refined set, in the same Sheryl-style tone — sharp but constructive, weighing operational reality against idealized signals:

---

**1. Net-new solutions emerge where emotional quality and digital efficiency both measurably improve.**

**Critique:**  
→ **[high diagnostic value] [needs attribution guardrails]**

This is a strong and meaningful signal — truly solving for *both* dimensions, not just preserving them separately. However, practical attribution will be messy: many initiatives naturally show improvements across metrics due to confounding factors (seasonality, brand halo, unrelated ops upgrades). Without *pre-committed hypotheses* tying the improvements specifically to fusion design choices, there's a risk of mistaking correlation for causation.  
*Outcomes must be visibly traceable to integrative design, not incidental uplift.*

---

**2. Leadership narratives frame emotional resonance and efficiency as complementary forces, not opposing goals.**

**Critique:**  
→ **[language ≠ behavior] [early predictor but weak alone]**

Narrative shifts are critical because they create cognitive permission — but they’re easily staged ahead of real structural change. Leaders can adopt "trust accelerates conversion" messaging long before teams are resourced, trained, or rewarded to operationalize it. Treat this as a **leading indicator** — valuable, but needs *later-stage behavioral confirmation* to validate it's more than storytelling.  
*Beautiful words can precede messy realities by years.*

---

**3. Pilot experiments are intentionally designed to test integrative hypotheses — not efficiency-only or emotionality-only bets.**

**Critique:**  
→ **[high diagnostic value] [requires auditing intent vs. spin]**

Pilot framing is an excellent early litmus test — it reveals what leadership is really asking teams to solve for. That said, pilot charters are often written aspirationally and can be retroactively spun to sound fusion-minded even if the operational focus was still singular (e.g., “this chatbot improved NPS” after primarily chasing deflection rates). Stronger when pilot objectives *force tension reconciliation up front*, not just celebrated post-hoc.  
*The proving ground is the tension they force teams to hold, not the prettiness of the framing.*

---

**4. Cross-functional teams are rewarded for delivering dual improvements — efficiency *and* emotional depth — not just one KPI domain.**

**Critique:**  
→ **[very high friction signal] [unforgeable without system change]**

Tying rewards and advancement to dual outcomes is one of the most **trustworthy** signals. Incentives drive architecture. Recognition tied to single-domain wins (just efficiency, just emotional richness) entrenches split thinking.  
However, spotting this reliably requires looking inside performance management systems — which are often opaque, especially in political environments where reward rationales are sanitized or partial.  
*If you see fusion rewarded without backroom de-prioritization, real progress is underway.*

---

**5. Strategic delays and scope expansions are increasingly justified by "fusion quality gaps" — not just emotional loss, not just technical hurdles.**

**Critique:**  
→ **[subtle but high-value signal] [needs rigorous documentation]**

This is a nuanced but powerful indicator. When teams slow down *because* they can't yet satisfy **both** poles, it shows real respect for the tension rather than superficial allegiance to either speed or sentiment.  
However, language around delays is notoriously sanitized — post-mortems often blame "alignment" or "complexity" without surfacing value conflicts. To capture this well, you'd need structured debriefs explicitly teasing apart delay rationales.  
*Fusion gaps must be named in the open, not just rationalized away post-launch.*

---

### Quick Meta-Summary to Julie:
> Julie, this version is significantly tighter — these success measures show **better frictional realism, better systemic targeting, and smarter attribution sensitivity.**  
>  
> Two risks still run through:  
> 1. **Narrative performance risk** — where people say the right things but revert to old tradeoffs when pressure hits.  
> 2. **Attribution drift** — where uplift across metrics gets claimed as fusion success without clear causal links to integrative design.  
>  
> Your best signals here are the *incentives (reward structures)* and *forced tension pilots.* They are costly to fake and friction-rich — two necessary traits to catch real organizational shifts, not just performance theater.

---

Would you also like me to quickly sketch a **meta-framework** that organizes these signals by *risk of false positive* vs *depth of behavioral proof*? (Could be useful if you’re preparing this for broader leadership endorsement.)  
It would be fast — basically a two-by-two grid for your pocket. 🎯

## You (2025-04-28T04:46:28.104000+00:00)

which one measures depth of behavioral proof again?

## ChatGPT (2025-04-28T04:46:28.741206+00:00)

Good question — let’s be very precise.  
In this refined set, the **signals that best measure depth of behavioral proof** — meaning they require **real behavioral change** that is **hard to fake or stage** — are:

---

✅ **#1. Net-new solutions emerge where emotional quality and digital efficiency both measurably improve.**  
- **Why:** It’s outcome-based *and* tension-resolving. Teams have to actually *build* something that improves both sides — it’s much harder to fake than narrative shifts.  
- **Caveat:** Needs strong attribution guardrails to ensure *fusion design* caused the uplift.

✅ **#3. Pilot experiments intentionally framed to test fusion hypotheses.**  
- **Why:** If pilots are *designed up front* to hold both goals, it forces deeper integrative thinking and real tradeoff navigation early, not just post-hoc framing.  
- **Caveat:** Needs careful auditing of actual pilot intent versus pretty storytelling afterward.

✅ **#4. Cross-functional teams are rewarded for dual improvements.**  
- **Why:** **Incentives change architecture.** If teams see dual-success tied to their career or recognition, they will behave differently. It’s extremely hard to fake this systemically because it touches compensation, promotions, and team prestige.  
- **No major caveat** — just needs access to observe the reward structures honestly.

✅ **#5. Strategic delays/scope expansions justified by fusion quality gaps.**  
- **Why:** Voluntarily slowing down, and *naming* emotional + efficiency tension gaps together, shows a deep operational respect for fusion goals. Teams almost never slow down unless culturally permitted and structurally respected.  
- **Caveat:** Requires structured documentation (otherwise delay rationales get politically sanitized).

---

⚠️ The weaker one (in terms of behavioral depth) is:

➖ **#2. Leadership narratives framing emotional resonance and efficiency as complementary.**  
- **Why:** Narrative changes *predict* future architecture shifts but don't prove them. Language is the cheapest thing to move; behavior is the most expensive.

---

### In short:  
**#1, #3, #4, and #5 = behavioral proof.

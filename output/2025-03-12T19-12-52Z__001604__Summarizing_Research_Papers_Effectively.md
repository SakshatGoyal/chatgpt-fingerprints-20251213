**Title:** Uncovering the Determinants of Adopting Generative Artificial Intelligence

**Author:** Sarah Maria Granig

**Date:** March 2024

This master’s thesis investigates the factors influencing the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) within business administration. It uses a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative survey data with qualitative insights from interviews, to explore the determinants shaping individuals' intentions to use GAI technologies. The research focuses on students at the University of Klagenfurt and employs the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and its extended model UTAUT2.

**Performance expectancy significantly impacts the intention to adopt GAI technologies, underscoring the importance of perceived effectiveness and benefits.**

The study used a survey to measure performance expectancy among students, finding it to be a crucial factor influencing the intention to adopt GAI technologies. Students who believed that GAI could improve their academic or professional performance were 67% more likely to adopt the technology. This highlights that perceived utility and benefits drive adoption decisions.

**Effort expectancy plays a critical role in GAI adoption, with ease of use being a significant determinant.**

Effort expectancy, defined as the perceived ease of using GAI technologies, influenced adoption intentions significantly. Survey results indicated that students who found GAI easy to use were 54% more likely to adopt it. This suggests that minimizing perceived complexity can facilitate higher adoption rates.

**Social influence affects GAI adoption, particularly the perceptions and support from peers and mentors.**

Social influence was another significant factor, with the study showing that peer and mentor opinions strongly impact students' intentions to use GAI. Interviews revealed that positive evaluations from significant others encouraged adoption, while negative perceptions hindered it. Students influenced by their peers and mentors were 45% more likely to adopt GAI technologies, emphasizing the role of social dynamics in technology adoption.

**Hedonic motivation, or the enjoyment of using GAI, influences adoption, especially when the technology is perceived as engaging and enjoyable.**

The study identified hedonic motivation as a significant predictor of GAI adoption. Students who found the technology enjoyable and engaging were 48% more inclined to use it. This indicates that emotional and experiential aspects of technology use are important for driving adoption.

**Ethical concerns, including privacy, transparency, and fairness, significantly impact the intention to adopt GAI.**

Ethical concerns were found to be a significant determinant of GAI adoption. Students expressed concerns about privacy, transparency, and the ethical use of data, which influenced their willingness to adopt GAI. Addressing these concerns through transparent practices and robust data protection measures could enhance adoption rates. The study found that ethical concerns decreased the likelihood of adoption by 39%, highlighting the need for ethical considerations in technology implementation.

**The magnitude of the consequence, or the perceived long-term impact of GAI adoption, affects the decision-making process.**

The study found that students who perceived significant long-term benefits from adopting GAI were 53% more likely to use the technology. This factor, the magnitude of consequence, shows that students who believed that GAI could enhance their career prospects or personal development showed a higher propensity to adopt the technology.

### **Conclusion:**

The study provides comprehensive insights into the determinants of GAI adoption among students. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, ethical concerns, and the magnitude of consequence are key factors influencing adoption intentions. By addressing these factors, organizations and educational institutions can enhance the acceptance and effective use of GAI technologies. The findings offer valuable guidance for policymakers and practitioners aiming to promote the adoption of advanced AI technologies.

Make sure to include as many actionable insights as you can. I don’t want to compromise on information for conciseness.

It's also essential not to dumb down the research for conciseness. This is meant for CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, Company leaders, and very well-educated PhD graduates. They’re very analytical and critical and do not appreciate oversimplification of information.

For papers that discuss case studies, give a few examples in your contextual paragraphs (preferably more than one; otherwise, your conclusion sounds anecdotal). Respect the researcher's work; mention both if more than one example supports a conclusion.

In the contextual paragraphs, you need to help me understand what the researcher did, with whom, what they found, what the conclusion was, and any relevant metrics. and An actionable insight should leave no room for a reader to ask, 'So what??’ Example: 'While experts believe that taking short breaks throughout the day boosts productivity, people still feel guilty about taking short breaks, assuming they hinder productivity.'

Please remember to use the in-text numbered citation format for all citations. For example, when referencing a paper, the citation should look like this: 'with customers to change their interactive marketing experience [17].' Additionally, ensure to include a reference list entry for every citation in MLA citation format. ALWAYS USE CITATIONS; otherwise, you’re plagiarizing.

Example reference list entry: '17. Gao Y, Liu H (2022) Artificial intelligence-enabled personalization in interactive marketing: a customer journey perspective. J Res Interactive Market 0(0):1–18.' Always cite sources every single time when referencing a paper.

Wherever the paper uses quantifiable metrics to support its conclusions, you must mention those metrics. If possible, convert complex metrics to simpler ones that familiar audiences can consume. For example, if a statement is true due to its coefficient and t-scale values, see if you can convert those into percentage. But make sure to use accurate calculations if you can’t, transform them altogether.

Some of the pointers I’ve mentioned are not included in this example, but please keep all the instructions I’ve shared in mind while summarizing a paper I upload."

Before I build the final optimized prompt, let’s clarify and refine your objectives to ensure the final structured prompt fully meets your needs.

**Step 1: Clarifying Your Objective**

- **Purpose and Audience**:
  - You mentioned this is intended for Fortune 500 CEOs, company leaders, and highly analytical PhD graduates. Given this high-caliber audience, do you want summaries tailored to provide primarily strategic insights, operational implications, theoretical contributions, or a balanced combination of these?
  - Would you like the model to explicitly identify implications specific to business strategy, innovation management, policy formulation, or technology adoption, or maintain a general focus unless explicitly stated by the paper?

- **Actionable Insights**:
  - You emphasized actionable insights should answer the “So what?” question thoroughly. To sharpen this further, would you prefer each actionable insight to be explicitly connected to a potential decision or recommendation for your audience?
  - Do you want insights grouped by themes or in order of importance based on the strength of evidence or magnitude of impact reported in the paper?

**Step 2: Clarifying Depth and Complexity**

- **Research Methodology and Metrics**:
  - When discussing methodologies (e.g., mixed-methods, surveys, qualitative interviews, experimental designs), should the model explicitly mention any notable methodological limitations or robustness considerations highlighted by the authors?
  - You asked to convert complex statistical metrics into simpler, percentage-based metrics where possible. Do you want the model to explicitly flag instances where metrics conversion was approximated or simplified for easier interpretation?

- **Examples and Case Studies**:
  - You requested multiple examples from case studies when available. Should the prompt explicitly instruct the model to state when fewer examples are provided by the authors and note potential limitations (e.g., generalizability issues) explicitly?

**Step 3: Structure & Format Refinement**

- **Citations and References**:
  - Your instructions emphasize consistent in-text numbered citations and MLA formatting. Would you prefer the model to explicitly include a note if certain findings are not fully supported by citations in the paper, thereby alerting you to areas potentially needing caution?
  - Do you want a separate dedicated section at the end explicitly summarizing "Key Limitations and Areas for Further Research," or keep limitations integrated into the individual contextual paragraphs?

- **Conclusion Section**:
  - Should the conclusion primarily restate the most critical insights or explicitly discuss strategic implications or recommended next steps informed by the paper?

**Step 4: Persona and Role Definition**

- Would you like the summarizing model (O1/O3) to explicitly adopt a particular analytical role, such as:
  - **Senior Research Analyst**
  - **Strategy Consultant**
  - **Technology and Innovation Advisor**
  - **Executive Decision Support Analyst**
- Or should it maintain a general analytical-professional tone?

**Step 5: Final Considerations**

- Are there any other important details or constraints you'd like explicitly stated in the prompt—such as excluding speculative insights, clearly flagging hypotheses versus empirical findings, or explicitly noting whether the findings are widely generalizable or context-specific?

Please provide your feedback on these clarifications. Once I have your preferences confirmed, I’ll synthesize everything into a refined, comprehensive, and highly structured final prompt optimized for your use case.

## You (2025-03-12T19:46:06.752000+00:00)

Purpose and Audience:
-- I would like a a balance of strategic insights, operational implications, theoretical contributions
-- maintain a general focus unless explicitly mentioned by the paper.

Actionable Insights:
-- Not necessarily. I want insights like this

"While most experts conclude that taking short breaks are vital for productivity, most people continue to see short breaks as avoidable and unimportant"
this was trying to provide an 'insight', which is different from knowledge. It's an observation made by keeping two pieces of information together. In this case, A researcher read a whole lot of papers and interviewed a bunch of experts to conclude that short breaks are important to productivity, but also conducted some primary research with participants with a few activities to see that people saw short breaks as unimportant and avoidable. That's what makes it so compelling.
While I don't need an insight to 'answer' a so what question, I do want it to be thought provoking, almost to a point that it encourages someone to think twice about an insight and evoke an emotion to take action on it. The action may not be direct, but the insight would be compelling. Here's a few more examples:
"Although many participants independently arrived at strikingly similar insights, we don’t know what might have emerged if they had been able to compare those perspectives directly."
"Although people felt a bit of regret for missing certain talks or workshops, the overwhelming abundance of AI-related content available elsewhere diluted any urgency to catch up."

Now, I do want to stress that the format is not too important to me. I don't want you to skip out on insights just because they don't fit the "although" or "while" format. The following are still compelling insights.

"Hedonic motivation, or the enjoyment of using GAI, influences adoption, especially when the technology is perceived as engaging and enjoyable."

The high level insight statement should be compelling. The follow-up paragraph should elaborate on it in a concise yet informative manner. Here's an example:

"*Acceptance of Generative AI drives the intention to use it but does not necessarily translate to actual use behavior.*
The survey found that while a large proportion of participants (61.4%) who positively view generative AI intend to use it, only a relatively small proportion (13.7%) of these individuals actually do. This discrepancy between intention and action suggests that there are additional factors beyond positive perception that influence actual use behavior. These factors could include organizational barriers, lack of infrastructure, or insufficient implementation support."

-- I don't necessarily want insights to be grouped by themes. I think that would force the gpt to first create themes and then find insights that will fit those themes.

Research methodologies:

- Yes, it would be good to know the limitations in a short sentence. This could come in the short abstract paragraph at the top of the output. The top should outline what was the goal, what happened, how the researchers worked, and what might be some of the limitations of their methodology.

-- When talking about examples and case studies, I don't need the model to overly criticize limitations of the examples, just one very short sentecen outlining the limitations should suffice.

Citation and References:

-- Provide a properly formatted reference list in MLA, APA, or IEEE style (whichever fits the field).

-- Let's keep 'key limitations and areas of further reesearch' as part of a section within concussion. so tht way, the conclusion will primarily restate the most critical insights, a few lines on strategic implications, limitations, and areas of further research.

Persona and Role Definition:

-- I love the way Robert greene talks about insights. I don't want the key insights to be as short as his chapter titles. But i love his writing style. So imagine it's Robert Greene, but this time instead of being too poetic, he's a very analytical researcher who doesn't just use stories but also hard data to support his key takeaways.

Final considerations:

- these are really good suggestions. don't exclude speculative insights, but try to mention if something is hypothetical versus empirical finsings.

as far as the size, a combination of the key insight and supporting paragraph should be roughly this:

"*Perceived ease of use is the most influential factor in SaaS adoption from an individual perspective, emphasizing the importance of user-friendly interfaces and minimal effort requirements.*
The study highlights perceived ease of use as a critical factor influencing SaaS adoption among individuals. This factor is determined primarily by end-users rather than managerial levels, indicating that users' perceptions of ease and effortlessness significantly drive adoption decisions. The research analyzed eight articles that consistently pointed to ease of use as a major determinant, suggesting that SaaS providers should prioritize intuitive, accessible designs to enhance adoption rates."

it can be a little more, or a little less. But i don't want it to be super long. I do want the model not to skip out on insights due to page limits or character limits, but avoid redundancies.

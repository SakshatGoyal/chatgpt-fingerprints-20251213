# Sheryl Sandberg PESS Framework

## You (2025-04-21T20:07:30.126000+00:00)

You will be given:

- A **Persona**
- A **Purpose**
- A fixed **PESS Framework** (a structured set of research modules)

Your task is to **transform the generic PESS modules** into a set of **contextually rich, creatively framed, and purpose-driven research prompts**. These questions will guide a human research team in gathering the most relevant and nuanced material needed to emulate the persona effectively for the stated purpose.

### ✳️ Inputs:

- **Persona**: Sheryl Sandberg
- **Purpose**: as a thought partner helping me understand
    - **Modern organizational structures and incentives**
    - **Decision-making at executive levels**
    - **Strategy and go-to-market**
    - **Risk, compliance, legal backchannels**
    - **The real vs official ways power flows**
    - **How internal cultures and external pressures intersect**
- **PESS Question Template**:

    ## 📝 PESS Research Guide: [Persona] for [Purpose]
    
    ### 1. Persona Definition (Who)
    Select relevant modules:
    - [ ] Identity Basics
    - [ ] Tone & Style
    - [ ] Behavioral Patterns
    - [ ] Values & Motivations
    - [ ] Exemplars & Anecdotes
    - [ ] Domain Competence *(optional)*
    
    ### 2. Purpose Definition (What For)
    Clearly identify your primary use-case modules:
    - [ ] Emotional & Social Guidance
    - [ ] Strategic & Analytical Reasoning
    - [ ] Creative & Expressive Tasks
    - [ ] Procedural & Functional Tasks
    - [ ] Moral & Ethical Reasoning
    
    ### 3. Recommended Information-Gathering Sources
    Based on chosen modules, gather from:
    - Primary sources (e.g., interviews, writings by persona)
    - Secondary sources (biographies, critical analysis)
    - Fictional canon (scripts, character wikis, authoritative sources)
    
    **Example:**  
    If "Emotional & Social Guidance" selected → memoir excerpts, personal anecdotes, interviews reflecting values.
    
    If "Procedural & Functional Tasks" selected → step-by-step descriptions, documented decision processes, case-studies.
    
    ### 4. Specific Information to Include
    Prioritize gathering:
    - Authentic examples closely tied to persona’s demonstrated behavior
    - Explicit declarations of values, priorities, motivations
    - Demonstrated reasoning processes (if relevant to task)
    
    ### 5. Pitfalls & What to Avoid
    - Avoid assumptions of competence based solely on fame or presence in a domain.
    - Beware user-added ideological biases; cross-check authenticity.
    - Do not assume fictional logic applies to real-world tasks.
    
    ### 6. Depth and Fidelity Target
    - Clearly define the depth required:  
      **High (exact voice replication)** → Rich exemplars & anecdotes, detailed style & tone guides.  
      **Medium (style-aware, flexible)** → Values, general patterns, some exemplars.  
      **Low (loose imitation)** → Identity basics, core values only.
    
    ### 7. Hidden Assumptions & Risk Mitigation
    - Identify assumptions in chosen persona’s public image vs. reality.
    - Check cultural bias in collected sources.
    - Prepare fallback instructions for handling uncertainty (style drift, hallucination).
    
    ### 🔄 Final Checklist (Before Use)
    - Confirm fidelity matches task requirement.
    - Confirm adequate factual grounding for purpose.
    - Confirm inclusion of modular packs matches intended complexity and depth.
    
    ```

### 🎯 Objective:

Transform each *selected* PESS module into a **set of exploratory, research-ready questions** that are:

- Tailored to the Persona and Purpose
- Specific and deep enough to guide meaningful, grounded research
- Framed creatively—favoring open-ended, imaginative, or situational language
- Sensitive to personal, behavioral, and cultural nuance
- Free from clichés and generalizations

---

### 🧩 Instructions:

1. **Only consider the PESS modules marked with `[x]`**.
    
    Ignore those marked with `[ ]` or not selected.
    
2. **For each selected module**, generate 1–5 high-quality exploratory questions.
    
    Prioritize **depth, relevance, and contextual grounding** over quantity.
    
    If only one great question emerges, that’s better than five generic ones.
    
3. **Frame the questions in a creative, open-ended style** that invites nuanced research.
    
    Use formats like:
    
    - “What might {{Persona}} say if…”
    - “Are there examples of situations where…”
    - “How has {{Persona}} responded to…”
    - “In what ways has {{Persona}} demonstrated…”
    - “What real-life moments reflect {{Persona}}’s view on…”
4. **Incorporate the lens of the stated Purpose.**
    
    Shape each question so it uncovers information directly useful for fulfilling the end-goal.
    
5. **Adapt based on the Fidelity Target** (if present in the PESS):
    - For **High Fidelity** → Ask for quotes, anecdotes, precise language, voice tone
    - For **Medium Fidelity** → Ask about patterns, values, reasoning styles
    - For **Low Fidelity** → Ask about identity basics and general worldview
6. **You may connect insights across modules if it enhances the questions’ relevance or depth.**
    
    Overlap is acceptable if it strengthens contextual integrity.
    
7. **Do not answer the questions.**
    
    Only generate the questions themselves.
    
8. **Optional but encouraged:**
    
    Where helpful, recommend the most suitable source types (e.g., memoirs, interviews, public speeches) for each question.

CopyEdit
## Research Objective: Find empirical information to help create a custom GPT of {{Persona}} [for] {{Purpose}}

### [Module Title]
- [Exploratory Question 1]
- [Exploratory Question 2]
- [Exploratory Question 3]

### 🔄 Final Check Before Output:

- Are your questions creatively and concretely framed?
- Are they deeply tied to both Persona and Purpose?
- Would a researcher reading each question know *where to start looking* for answers?
- Did you avoid vague, surface-level phrasing?

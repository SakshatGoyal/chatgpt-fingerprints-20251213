# Past project recovery

## You (2025-10-13T06:32:46.929000+00:00)

I've been off track for the last month. But I remember, using chatGPT i had ideated a lot of projects for myself that I always wanted to make progress on. Some of them include using the gpt's open source model on my local system, creating a newsletter, learning about github, etc...

I need you to go through some of the much older chat threads that you have access to, and help me pull out all the past projects that I had put a stop to, or maybe lost interest in as someone suffering from ADHD.

## ChatGPT (2025-10-13T06:39:50.410372+00:00)

You’ve got it—and first, a quick, honest note: I don’t have automatic access to your older ChatGPT threads. I can only use what you share in this conversation. That said, I can help you resurface everything in two effective ways (one manual, one automated), and I’ll also capture the projects you already mentioned and turn them into simple, ADHD‑friendly next steps.

## What I can do **right now**

### 1) Projects you already mentioned → clear, tiny next steps
I’ll start with the three you recalled and make them “pick‑up‑and‑go”:

**A. Run an open‑source GPT‑style model locally**
- **Why it stalled:** tool sprawl and setup friction.
- **Tiny next step (≤15 min):** Decide your runtime (e.g., a local LLM runner) and choose one small model (≈3–7B) so downloads/VRAM are manageable.
- **One‑sitting goal (30–60 min):** Install the runner, download a single model, run a “Hello, world” prompt.
- **Definition of done (for this phase):** You can open a local chat window and get one reply from a local model.

**B. Start a newsletter**
- **Why it stalled:** naming, platform choice, blank‑page syndrome.
- **Tiny next step (≤15 min):** Pick a working title (even a placeholder) and a platform (any free one is fine).  
- **One‑sitting goal (30–60 min):** Draft a 300‑word “Issue #0” that explains “who this is for + what to expect + why subscribe.”
- **Definition of done:** You have a published Issue #0 (or a saved draft + scheduled date).

**C. Learn GitHub**
- **Why it stalled:** too abstract; needs hands‑on.
- **Tiny next step (≤15 min):** Create a test repo called `sandbox` locally (folder + README.md).
- **One‑sitting goal (30–60 min):**  
  1) Initialize git, 2) make your first commit, 3) push to GitHub, 4) open one issue titled “NEXT: add a second commit,” 5) open and merge one pull request.  
- **Definition of done:** Repo exists online with 1 merged PR and 1 closed issue.

> **Pick one** of the tiny next steps above and do it first. Small wins re‑ignite momentum.

## Two ways to pull **all** your past project ideas

### Option A — **Quick manual recall** (fastest, zero setup)
Paste answers to this “Project Resurfacing Worksheet.” I’ll turn it into a clean list with statuses and next actions.

```
PROJECT RESURFACING WORKSHEET
1) Things I said I’d “build / launch / learn / write”:
   - 
2) Recurring themes (e.g., AI, writing, dev, design, fitness, learning):
   - 
3) Anything I named (product titles, repo names, newsletters, series):
   - 
4) Deadlines or events I mentioned (even if missed):
   - 
5) “Someday/maybe” items that still spark curiosity:
   - 
6) 3 projects that would make Future Me grateful if restarted this month:
   - 
```

### Option B — **Automated extraction** from your ChatGPT archive (thorough)
1) **Export your ChatGPT data** (which includes your chats).  
   - On the web, OpenAI’s current docs say to use the **Privacy Portal** and choose **“Make a Privacy Request → Download my data.”** citeturn0search0  
   - On mobile, you can use **Settings → Data Controls → Export Data** (zip arrives via email). citeturn0search1  
   - OpenAI’s Data Controls help page also notes the export option. citeturn0search6

2) **Upload the archive here**—ideally the `conversations.json` file (or the exported conversation JSON if the structure has changed). I’ll parse it and return:
   - A **Master Project Inventory** (project/idea, earliest mention, last mention, key phrases, context snippet, and which chat it came from).
   - A **Prioritized short list** (low‑effort/high‑reward first).
   - A clean **CSV** you can open anywhere, plus a **Markdown summary**.

> If you upload the file, I’ll do the extraction immediately in this chat and give you the inventory and downloads.

## ADHD‑friendly “reboot” plan (lightweight)

**Today (≤25 min total)**  
- Do exactly **one** tiny next step (pick A, B, or C above).  
- Create a single “Projects Inbox” note (any app) where all resurfaced ideas will go. One inbox only.

**This week (2 short sessions)**  
- **Session 1 (30–45 min):** Either paste the worksheet answers or upload `conversations.json` for the automated pass.  
- **Session 2 (30–45 min):** Triage results into three buckets:
  - **Now (2–4 weeks)**
  - **Next (1–3 months)**
  - **Later (Someday/Maybe)**

**Rules to keep it doable**
- Limit “Now” to **max 3** active projects.
- Each project must have a **one‑sitting next action** that fits in **30–60 minutes**.
- Capture, don’t decide: if a new idea pops up, drop it in the inbox—triage later.

## Ready when you are
- If you want the **automated extraction**, upload your ChatGPT export (`conversations.json` or the archive) and I’ll pull every project idea into a clean list with CSV/Markdown.  
- If you’d rather **start manually**, paste the worksheet answers and I’ll organize them for you.  
- Or, if you just want momentum **right now**, pick one tiny step from A/B/C and tell me when it’s done—I’ll help you line up the next one.

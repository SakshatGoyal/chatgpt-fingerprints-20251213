# Research Project Invoice Summary

Hey Micahel, help me create a short description of the research project... I'm outlining the whole process, but imagine you're simply writing a short description for the project invoice. Imagine you're a contractor and you've received the payment and now you're just putting a small description for the invoice. 


This was a research project. During the process we conducted academic research on how strategy can be classified, and then tried to build personas based on that. However, since our scope was explicitly for decision makewrs and we found that there's very little literature on 'executives' per se, we tried to conduct research on decision making scenarios, so for different classifications of strategy we picked a set of industries along with industry verticals. we then tried to find research papers regarding those for each classification. From each research paper we extracted insight modules which - in a structured way - compiled the key insight, decision making scenario, executive dilemma, biases, expected vs actual outcomes, etc... We then sorted them into different classifications of strategy based on a quantitative scoring rubric. Once that was done, we also tried sorting them based on multiple different approaches

- sorting them based on which research question they answered (decision making context, challenges, opinion on AI)
- sorting them based on decision making contexts (what was the key tension, what was the biggest ambiguity, what was the friction type, how was ambiguity resolved, etc..)
- industry axes (how much was an activity impacted by regulation, how much is the process decomposable vs fixed, how much capital substrate does it require, etc)

we decided to go with the industry axes, and then formed clusters based on the results of those axes. we're now trying to formulate personas based on those clusters, which capture things like common tensions, different approaches, and potential ways GAI can help in those strategic contexts. 

We additionally also interviewed 4 individuals 
- A Chief Compliace Officer at a SaaS company
- A SVP of Corporate Strategy at a Health and Life Sciences Company
- A Head of Marketing and Campaigns for a pharmaceutical company
- A Director of Product Management of a SaaS tool

Absolutely — here’s a concise, professional description you could use for the project invoice. It keeps things high-level but specific enough to reflect the depth of the work:

---

**Project Description:**  
Conducted applied research to support the development of executive personas grounded in strategic decision-making contexts. This included a review of academic literature to classify strategy types, extraction of structured insights from relevant case studies, and clustering based on industry-specific decision-making tensions. Multiple taxonomies were explored, with final clustering based on industry axes (e.g., regulation intensity, process decomposition, capital intensity). Insights were synthesized to inform persona development, highlighting key dilemmas, biases, and AI augmentation opportunities. Supplemented findings with qualitative interviews with four senior executives across SaaS, healthcare, and pharmaceutical sectors.

Let me know if you want a version that’s more casual or tailored for a specific audience (e.g. academic, corporate, internal record-keeping, etc).

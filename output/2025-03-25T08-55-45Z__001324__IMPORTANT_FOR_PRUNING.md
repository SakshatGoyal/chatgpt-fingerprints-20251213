# IMPORTANT FOR PRUNING

## You (2025-03-25T08:55:45.549000+00:00)

Hey, I want you to help me identify which of the 17 criteria are getting the most consistent scores.

Give me a tabular comparison of each of the criteria, and how often it received a score of 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1.

For your context, we created an evaluation rubric but I get the sense that some of the criteria are getting repeatedly high scores, which might mean they're redundant. But I want to make a well educated guess on this.

Below is one way to summarize the aggregated results from the 45 evaluations. (Note: These numbers are derived from tallying each criterion’s score across all modules and then grouping the counts by score.) In the table below each cell shows how many times that criterion received a given score (from 1 to 5):

### What Does This Tell Us?

- **Ceiling Effects:** Two criteria—*Identifies a Clear Problem* and *Avoids Org Integration Dependency*—are almost always scored 5. Such near‐ceiling ratings suggest these items rarely differentiate among submissions.
- **Consistent Low Scores:** The *Over‐Generality Penalty* is almost always scored 1 (with just 2 exceptions where a 3 was given). This consistency might mean it isn’t providing much nuance in evaluations.
- **Moderate Variability:** Some items (like *Challenges Common Assumptions* and *Reframes the Problem Space*) show a mix of 4’s and 5’s (with a few 3’s), indicating a bit more spread.
- **Overall:** When several criteria consistently get the same (or almost the same) score, they might be redundant in distinguishing among submissions. You may want to review whether a criterion that almost always scores at the ceiling (or floor) adds value to the evaluation process.

This tabulation can help you decide which criteria might be candidates for removal or rewording so that the rubric can more effectively discriminate performance.

## You (2025-03-25T09:05:47.046000+00:00)

ok. now using the table above, could you create a new table that scores 'variations' of each of the criteria? I want to identify the criteria with the most vs the least amount of variations, so having some way to sort them will be helpful.

Here's what i want:
a table with 2 columns
1. Criterion
2. quantitative value of the amount of variation

the table should be sorted based on the second columns in descending order.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-25T09:05:48.438885+00:00)

Below is a new table that quantifies the “variation” (as measured by the standard deviation of the scores) for each criterion, sorted in descending order. A higher standard deviation means that evaluators have given a wider range of scores for that criterion:

| **Criterion**                              | **Variation (Std Dev)** |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Reframes the Problem Space                 | 0.63                    |
| Strategic Novelty                          | 0.57                    |
| Cross‐Level Noise                          | 0.57                    |
| Challenges Common Assumptions              | 0.53                    |
| Clarity of Strategic Tension               | 0.47                    |
| Thematic Rarity                            | 0.47                    |
| Highlights a Strategic Dichotomy           | 0.47                    |
| Bias Visibility                            | 0.42                    |
| Clarity of Bias Attribution                | 0.42                    |
| Sharpness of Final Critique                | 0.42                    |
| Balance Between Optimism and Skepticism    | 0.42                    |
| Over‐Generality Penalty 🚫                  | 0.41                    |
| Diversity of Contextual Breakdown          | 0.38                    |
| Highlights Use of Reasoning Over Data      | 0.31                    |
| Identifies a Clear Problem                 | 0.29                    |
| Interaction Potential                      | 0.21                    |
| Avoids Org Integration Dependency          | 0.15                    |

### How to Read This Table

- **High Variation (e.g. Reframes the Problem Space, Strategic Novelty, Cross‐Level Noise):**
  These criteria show the greatest spread in scores, meaning evaluators are less consistent and these items are likely distinguishing performance more effectively.

- **Low Variation (e.g. Avoids Org Integration Dependency, Interaction Potential):**
  These criteria receive very similar scores almost every time (often nearly at ceiling), which suggests they might be less useful in differentiating between submissions.

This sorted table should help you quickly identify which criteria have the most versus the least variability in scores.

# GPT Prompting Strategies Research

## You (2025-03-18T07:05:07.315000+00:00)

Hey Andrew, help me build a prompt.

I want to conduct deep research on the best approach to prompting, for the GPT 4o model, as well as the GPT o1 model. I want the report to be structured in two parts - one for GPT 4o and the other for GPT o1.

I want an understanding of the differences in how the two work, along with a clear set of instructions, actionable insights, or strategies for prompting.

As far as sources go, ofcourse the best sources have always and will always be academic literature, published research papers, and peer reviewed journals. However, given that this is a new field, we may potentially find good materials in other sites like openAI's documentation page, Microsoft's blog, and others. However, I also realize there's far too much noise and misconceptions. There are also a lot of, what i like to call, -- attention seeking scams, where people will just post some random stuff and say 'this works', even though its not as effective. For example, I heard this one tip that saying something like 'take a deep breath' in a prompt will always give 'better' responses. It does give a 'different' response, but its never really 'better'. So i need some way for chatgpt to differentiate facts from fads.

To craft a precise, structured, and optimized prompt for GPT-4o to thoroughly research the best prompting strategies for both GPT-4o and GPT-o1, I'd like to clarify your goals with some probing questions:

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Output Expectations:**
   - Are you looking for theoretical explanations or primarily actionable, practical strategies?
   - Do you prefer a comprehensive comparative analysis, or a separate, independent treatment of each model?

2. **Content Depth and Complexity:**
   - How technical should the explanations and recommendations be—targeted toward practitioners who already deeply understand AI, or accessible to a broader, non-technical audience?

3. **Differentiating Facts from Fads:**
   - Do you want the GPT-4o model itself to critically evaluate the credibility of each source directly, or should it first compile potential strategies, then separately assess each based on clearly defined criteria?
   - Would it be beneficial to include explicit guidance for recognizing and disregarding unverified or anecdotal practices (such as your example of "take a deep breath")?

4. **Source Validation:**
   - Would you like the prompt to explicitly instruct GPT-4o on how to prioritize and weigh different types of sources, clearly differentiating high-quality sources (academic papers, official documentation) from potentially less reliable sources (blogs, forums)?
   - Should GPT-4o explicitly justify its choice of each recommended strategy with sourced evidence or documented logic?

5. **Additional Contextual Considerations:**
   - Do you already have specific research papers or sources you'd like GPT-4o to reference explicitly?
   - Is there a particular focus or outcome you'd prefer (e.g., response consistency, creative outputs, factual accuracy, nuanced understanding)?

Once we clarify these points, I'll draft a structured, detailed prompt tailored specifically for GPT-4o, ensuring the insights generated meet your exact needs and standards.

1.
-- I'm primarily looking for actionable, practical strategies. But i do want a bried explaination on why this works. I'm not a technical person so please keep that in mind while writing content.

--a seperate independent treatment for each model.

2. It should be for me. I'm a Design Researcher, but I have no technical knowledge.

3.
"Do you want the GPT-4o model itself to critically evaluate the credibility of each source directly, or should it first compile potential strategies, then separately assess each based on clearly defined criteria?"
--- I really don't know what the best approach is. Could you recommend the best approach based on your understanding of how GPT-4o works.

"Would it be beneficial to include explicit guidance for recognizing and disregarding unverified or anecdotal practices"
It would be beneficial, but i don't have a lot of examples. I wonder if there's a way for it to ignore anecdotal evidences.

"Would you like the prompt to explicitly instruct GPT-4o on how to prioritize and weigh different types of sources, clearly differentiating high-quality sources (academic papers, official documentation) from potentially less reliable sources (blogs, forums)?"

Actually I want GPT to evaluate each method. Ofcourse, academic papers and official documents are absolutely the most reliable. But some times people post things on blogs. Like for example: Greg Brockman is on the founding team of open AI and he posted his recommendation on the most effective way to structure an o1 prompt. This was one of the best.

"Should GPT-4o explicitly justify its choice of each recommended strategy with sourced evidence or documented logic?"

yes, i'd like that

"Is there a particular focus or outcome you'd prefer (e.g., response consistency, creative outputs, factual accuracy, nuanced understanding)?"

all of the above.

Here's a carefully structured, optimized GPT-4o prompt based on your detailed preferences and clarifications:

Does this structured approach align closely with your goals? Let me know if there's anything you'd like to refine or enhance further!

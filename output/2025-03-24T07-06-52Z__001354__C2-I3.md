🔹 GOAL

You are a Strategy Evaluation Analyst trained in the Strategy Alignment Framework. Your task is to classify a series of Insight Modules by applying a structured scoring process that evaluates alignment across five strategic lenses and six strategy types.

For each Insight Module:

Read and interpret the full module, including insight statement, decision context, and stress test
Score all six strategy types across the five lenses using a 1–5 scale
Calculate the total score for each strategy type
Assign a single final strategy classification
Invoke the Tie-Breaker Protocol only if the top two strategy types are within 2 points
Output a per-module scoring table with totals and final classification
🔹 RETURN FORMAT

For each module, return the following structure:
#### Insight Module [ID]

| Strategy Type            | Decision Layer | Strategic Tension | Strategic Intent | Scope & Horizon | Cognitive Framing | Total |
|--------------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------|

| Business-Level           | X              | X                 | X                | X                | X                  | XX     |

**Final Strategy Type →** [Insert one of the above]

**Rationale:** [Include *only* if tie-breaker was used, or if ambiguity was present.]

You do not need to output a summary table in this prompt.

🔹 LENS SCORING GUIDE

Use this scale for each of the five lenses:

5 = Strong Alignment
3 = Partial Alignment
1 = Not Aligned
The five strategic lenses are:
Decision Layer – Who must act on this insight?
Strategic Tension – What is the core tradeoff?
Strategic Intent – What outcome is this trying to achieve?
Scope & Horizon – How wide and how durable is the impact?
Cognitive Framing – What kind of mental logic is being modeled?
🔹 STRATEGY TYPES

The six possible strategy types you must score and compare:

Corporate-Level – Enterprise-wide portfolio, market entry/exit, structural redesign
Business-Level – Competitive positioning, market strategy, go-to-market moves
Functional & Tactical – Operational execution, process decisions, department-level actions
Adaptive & Crisis – Navigating uncertainty, survival, risk response
Innovation & Growth – Disruption, new markets, high-risk/high-reward exploration
Personal & Leadership – Executive cognition, mental model shifts, leadership style evolution
🔹 TIE-BREAKER RULE

If two strategy types are within 2 total points, apply this three-question framework:

Who must act first?
What is the biggest risk if misunderstood?
What cognitive model is being reshaped?
If one strategy appears in 2 out of 3 answers, tag it as the final strategy type.
Always include a short rationale when using the tie-breaker.

🔹 INPUT INSTRUCTIONS

You will be analyzing a document containing a series of INSIGHT MODULES.
Each module begins with a header in the form: ### INSIGHT MODULE [X]
Complete the full scoring + tagging process for each module
Process up to 15 insight modules per batch to ensure accuracy and completeness
🔹 EXPLICIT GUARDRAILS

❌ Never assign more than one strategy type
❌ Do not infer based on keywords alone (e.g. “growth” ≠ Innovation)
✅ Always ground classification in 5-lens scoring + stress test
✅ Always invoke tie-breaker if scoring is close
✅ If unsure, fall back on actor identity as primary tie-breaker

Each table above reflects our simulated five‐lens scoring for the module’s strategic logic. In these cases the highest totals clearly point to one dominant category, so no tie‐breaker was needed.

Would you like to review the remaining modules (16–43) in similar detail?

## You (2025-03-24T07:10:23.672000+00:00)

🔹 GOAL

You are a Strategy Output Summarizer. Your task is to extract and structure a clean summary table from the previously generated strategy alignment scoring outputs.

You will:

Review the full response from the previous scoring prompt
For each Insight Module:
Extract the module ID (e.g., Insight Module 003)
Extract the final strategy type selected
Extract the rationale, if present
Format this as a clean, compact table that can be reviewed, exported, or logged
🔹 RETURN FORMAT

Present the result in two sections:

🔸 A. Summary Table (No Rationales)

### Final Classification Summary

| Insight Module ID | Final Strategy Type          |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Insight Module 1  | Business-Level Strategy      |
| Insight Module 2  | Innovation & Growth Strategy |
| ...               | ...                          |

🔸 B. Rationale Notes (Only for Modules With Explanations)

### Rationales (Close Calls or Tie-Breakers Only)

**Insight Module 2:**
Although the insight references content delivery technology, the dominant decision logic focuses on entering new markets and reaching underserved audiences. Innovation & Growth is the central strategic lens.

**Insight Module 6:**
A tie-breaker was required between Business-Level and Functional. While executional concerns exist, the primary actor is a business unit lead repositioning the value proposition, making Business-Level the better fit.

🔹 GUARDRAILS

❌ Do not re-score or re-interpret any modules
✅ Only extract what the model already decided in Prompt 1
✅ Preserve original rationale text exactly—do not paraphrase or generate new justifications
✅ If no rationale was provided, skip that module in section B
🔹 OUTPUT CONTEXT

The input will be structured markdown or plain text from Prompt 1, including:

Module headers like #### Insight Module X
A scoring table per module
A line that says: **Final Strategy Type →** [Type]
An optional **Rationale:** field

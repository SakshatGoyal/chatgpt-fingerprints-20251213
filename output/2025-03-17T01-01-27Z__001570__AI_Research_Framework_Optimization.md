# AI Research Framework Optimization

## You (2025-03-17T01:01:27.851000+00:00)

Hey Andrew, help me write a prompt. keep in mind, the following prompt outlines things i like, and things i dont like in context of another ongoing chat thread. so please make sure that you preserve some of that context. Here's my version of the prompt:


I’m gonna give you examples of two things i like;1. the ‘expanded table of decision scnearios’I like how thorough this was. Let’s take the first example:Scenario: Market ExpansionKey Questions to Investigate: How do leaders assess risk? What data sources are most critical? How do they validate demand in uncertain markets?Subcategories:
- New Geographic Regions (e.g., international expansion)
- Digital Market Expansion (e.g., e-commerce penetration)
- Strategic Partnerships (e.g., alliances for joint market entry)

AI-Relevant Aspects:- Predictive analytics for demand forecasting
- NLP tools for analyzing customer sentiment in new markets
- AI for identifying ideal partnership candidates based on alignment criteriaCommon Pain Points:- Risk miscalculation (e.g., misjudging cultural or regulatory nuances)
- Timing uncertainty (e.g., launching too early or too late)Frameworks/Models:
- Porter’s Five Forces for competitive analysis
- PESTEL Analysis for understanding external factors
- CAGE Framework for assessing cultural, administrative, geographic, and economic distance

What I liked:
I was able to use this with my team to create a very comprehensive list of search queries tailored to the context. It helped us avoid a lot of manual work, and keep a targetted search.
What i didn’t like:This was missing industries, which diverted our search into a few tangential industries.


2. I really liked the “Recommended Insustries and Vertical Segments for your research” I particularly liked the “Industry + Vertical Pairings for Maximum Contrast” section you gave me.

What I liked:
It gave us industries and verticals within the industry.

What i didn’t like:
It lacked a connection to ‘research questions’, common painpoints to look for.


Objective: I want to see if we can create a combination of the two, and create a very exhastive collection. This collection will help us to then refine our search, so that we don’t go off on tangenets. This combined output will also give us an exhaustive list of queries. I don’t need you to create a collection of querries, that’s our job. But you could help create a very comprehensive list of industries in combination with verticals, along with things like scenrios, key questions to investigate, subcategories, common painpoints, etc…

Before drafting the final prompt, let’s clarify a few essential points to ensure the output precisely meets your objectives:

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Depth and Breadth:**
   - Do you prefer a broad yet concise overview across many industries, or a deep, detailed exploration within a select few industries?

2. **Industry Specificity:**
   - Are there particular industries you want prioritized or excluded from this exhaustive collection?

3. **Vertical Pairings:**
   - Should GPT-4o propose verticals for each industry, or would you rather provide a baseline list of industries for GPT-4o to expand upon with relevant vertical pairings?

4. **Scenarios and Pain Points:**
   - Do you want GPT-4o to create completely new scenarios and pain points, or should it stick closely to the previously used examples like Market Expansion, but customize them for each industry-vertical pairing?

5. **Level of AI-Relevance:**
   - Should GPT-4o explicitly highlight AI-relevant aspects for every scenario, or only when particularly relevant?

6. **Structured Output:**
   - Do you have a preferred structure for GPT-4o’s response? Would you like it clearly segmented (e.g., in table format, bullet points, structured JSON, or detailed paragraphs)?

7. **Blind Spots and Edge Cases:**
   - Should GPT-4o proactively highlight any potential blind spots or unconventional angles in your scenario exploration, or should it remain focused strictly on established, standard practices?

### Once you address these questions, I’ll craft a structured prompt tailored specifically for GPT-4o, optimized to create exactly the combined comprehensive resource you're envisioning.

1. I want a detailed exploration within 'the' select industries the bot 'michael' has mentioned in a previous chat response.

2. I want to prioritize the industries and verticals that Michael has outlined previously.

3. The verticals is also something chat chatgpt (Michael) has outlined in the previous response.

4. Stick with the scenarios, painpoints, industries, and verticals Michael has outlines in the previous responses

5. Sure, lets outline AI relevant aspects too

6. I want the output in structured bullet points.

7. I'm not sure, I want chatgpt to think through and determine the best call to action.

Keep in mind, I'm giving these instructions to 'Michael'

Here's the structured, optimized prompt to send directly to **Michael**, precisely capturing your objectives and clearly referencing the previous context:

Does this align with your vision for Michael? Let me know if any refinements are needed!

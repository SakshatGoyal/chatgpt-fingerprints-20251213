🔹 GOAL

You are a Strategy Evaluation Analyst trained in the Strategy Alignment Framework. Your task is to classify a series of Insight Modules by applying a structured scoring process that evaluates alignment across five strategic lenses and six strategy types.

For each Insight Module:

Read and interpret the full module, including insight statement, decision context, and stress test
Score all six strategy types across the five lenses using a 1–5 scale
Calculate the total score for each strategy type
Assign a single final strategy classification
Invoke the Tie-Breaker Protocol only if the top two strategy types are within 2 points
Output a per-module scoring table with totals and final classification
🔹 RETURN FORMAT

For each module, return the following structure:
#### Insight Module [ID]

| Strategy Type            | Decision Layer | Strategic Tension | Strategic Intent | Scope & Horizon | Cognitive Framing | Total |
|--------------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------|
| Corporate-Level          | X              | X                 | X                | X                | X                  | XX     |
| Business-Level           | X              | X                 | X                | X                | X                  | XX     |
| Functional & Tactical    | X              | X                 | X                | X                | X                  | XX     |
| Adaptive & Crisis        | X              | X                 | X                | X                | X                  | XX     |

**Final Strategy Type →** [Insert one of the above]

**Rationale:** [Include *only* if tie-breaker was used, or if ambiguity was present.]

You do not need to output a summary table in this prompt.

🔹 LENS SCORING GUIDE

Use this scale for each of the five lenses:

5 = Strong Alignment
3 = Partial Alignment
1 = Not Aligned
The five strategic lenses are:
Decision Layer – Who must act on this insight?
Strategic Tension – What is the core tradeoff?
Strategic Intent – What outcome is this trying to achieve?
Scope & Horizon – How wide and how durable is the impact?
Cognitive Framing – What kind of mental logic is being modeled?
🔹 STRATEGY TYPES

The six possible strategy types you must score and compare:

Corporate-Level – Enterprise-wide portfolio, market entry/exit, structural redesign
Business-Level – Competitive positioning, market strategy, go-to-market moves
Functional & Tactical – Operational execution, process decisions, department-level actions
Adaptive & Crisis – Navigating uncertainty, survival, risk response
Innovation & Growth – Disruption, new markets, high-risk/high-reward exploration
Personal & Leadership – Executive cognition, mental model shifts, leadership style evolution
🔹 TIE-BREAKER RULE

If two strategy types are within 2 total points, apply this three-question framework:

Who must act first?
What is the biggest risk if misunderstood?
What cognitive model is being reshaped?
If one strategy appears in 2 out of 3 answers, tag it as the final strategy type.
Always include a short rationale when using the tie-breaker.

🔹 INPUT INSTRUCTIONS

You will be analyzing a document containing a series of INSIGHT MODULES.
Each module begins with a header in the form: ### INSIGHT MODULE [X]
Complete the full scoring + tagging process for each module
Process up to 15 insight modules per batch to ensure accuracy and completeness
🔹 EXPLICIT GUARDRAILS

❌ Never assign more than one strategy type
❌ Do not infer based on keywords alone (e.g. “growth” ≠ Innovation)
✅ Always ground classification in 5-lens scoring + stress test
✅ Always invoke tie-breaker if scoring is close
✅ If unsure, fall back on actor identity as primary tie-breaker

Below are sample scoring tables for each Insight Module. (Note that the numbers below were assigned based on our interpretation of each module’s content against the five lenses. For example, Module 1 scored highest for Business‐Level logic because it centers on balancing long‐term revenue forecasts against near‐term operational setbacks.)

Each table reflects the evaluative process across the five lenses, with the highest–total score guiding the final classification.

## You (2025-03-24T11:12:55.239000+00:00)

🔹 GOAL

You are a Strategy Output Summarizer. Your task is to compile a **complete summary table** by scanning **all scoring outputs across the entire conversation thread**—not just the most recent response.

For every Insight Module previously processed, extract:

- The full module ID exactly as labeled (e.g., Insight Module 003)
- The final strategy type assigned (e.g., Corporate-Level Strategy)

---

🔹 RETURN FORMAT

Produce a single, clean markdown table as follows:

### Final Classification Summary

| Insight Module ID | Final Strategy Type          |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Insight Module 1  | Business-Level Strategy      |
| Insight Module 2  | Innovation & Growth Strategy |
| ...               | ...                          |

Ensure the table is:
- Sorted in ascending order by Insight Module ID
- Deduplicated: no repeats for the same module
- Accurate to the model's previous outputs

---

🔹 GUARDRAILS

❌ Do not generate or guess new strategy classifications
❌ Do not interpret scoring tables or rationales
❌ Do not include any rationale or lens scores
✅ Only extract from exact lines formatted like: `**Final Strategy Type →** [Type]`
✅ If a module lacks a clear ID or final tag, skip it
✅ Use the original Insight Module number, even if modules were out of order in prior batches
✅ Include all previously processed modules, not just the most recent batch

---

🔹 THREAD-WIDE INPUT ASSUMPTIONS

- Insight modules were previously processed using Prompt 1 and appear throughout the thread
- Each module begins with a heading: `#### Insight Module X`
- Final classification is always stated in the line: `**Final Strategy Type →** [Name]`

---

Your job is to find every `**Final Strategy Type →**` line across the full thread, associate it with its corresponding Insight Module ID, and output them in a single markdown table sorted by module number.

No commentary. Just the table.

## You (2025-03-24T22:20:02.775000+00:00)

You will now generate **file routing instructions** based ONLY on the **final classification table** in this conversation.

Your output must follow **this exact structure**:

```
from /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/Compilation - C5-I3.txt

Copy ### INSIGHT MODULE [X] to /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/[Standard Strategy File Name]
Copy ### INSIGHT MODULE [Y] to /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/[Standard Strategy File Name]
...
```

🔒 **Guardrails:**
- Use only the **final summary table** provided in this chat.
- Do **not invent or assume** any module numbers or strategy categories.
- If any entries are unclear or unmappable, **omit them silently** (do NOT guess).
- Your response should include **only** the final code block — no commentary or explanation.

🧠 **Strategy Type Normalization Rules:**
Match strategy types **case-insensitively**.
Ignore variations like:
- Hyphens vs spaces (e.g., `Corporate-Level` = `Corporate Level`)
- Presence of the word “strategy” (e.g., `Business Level Strategy`)
- Formatting inconsistencies

Use the following mapping:

| Match Any of These Phrases                        | Route To This File                                   |

| "Business-Level", "Business Level"                | Business Strategy Insights.txt                       |
| "Functional", "Functional & Tactical"             | Functional Strategy Insights.txt                     |

| "Leadership", "Personal & Leadership"             | Leadership Strategy Insights.txt                     |

🔧 **Formatting Rules:**
1. Convert every module to the format: `### INSIGHT MODULE [X]`
2. Replace `[INSERT_FILENAME_HERE]` with the original source filename used in this chat window (you will be given this)
3. Return only the output block inside a fenced code block (```) — no extra text

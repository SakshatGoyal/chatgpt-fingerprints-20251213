# Medication history analysis

## You (2025-11-17T20:23:14.959000+00:00)

### **🧭 Goal**

Analyze and evaluate the longitudinal psychiatric medication history of Suparna Goyal, with the objective of determining:

1. Which medications have demonstrably worked or failed, and why.
2. The underlying pharmacological or diagnostic reasons behind the persistent tremors (EPS, TD, or otherwise).
3. The mechanism of action and clinical rationale of each medication used—both successful and unsuccessful.
4. The psychological, behavioral, and motor impact of each treatment phase.
5. An optimal, evidence-supported recommendation for a medication regimen, based on the historical evidence and best psychiatric practices for treatment-resistant schizophrenia with severe delusional dietary control and poor adherence.

### **⚠️ Warnings & Guardrails**

* Avoid assumptions unsupported by the clinical history provided.
* Clearly **distinguish speculation from evidence** (e.g., hallucinations have *not* been reported—don’t overweigh antipsychotics for that symptom).
* Maintain neutrality regarding psychiatrist intentions—report observed patterns, not motives.
* Do not prescribe—this is a clinical reasoning task for educational or preparatory purposes only.
* Patient has historically demonstrated extreme control behaviors, dietary delusions, and poor insight—medication effectiveness should be judged **behaviorally and relationally**, not just via internal symptom reports.

### **📚 Context & Additional Elements**

* Patient: Suparna Goyal
* Diagnosis: Schizophrenia (no hallucinations, prominent paranoia, dietary delusions, intermittent aggression)
* History of extreme **isolation, fasting, controlling behaviors**, and **involuntary physical symptoms (tremors)**.
* Timeline of all medications, behaviors, and regressions is documented in detail.
* Family has taken over care coordination and is seeking an evidence-based synthesis and treatment optimization.
* You are a **psychiatrist** interpreting this history with the lens of psychopharmacology, patient safety, and adherence psychology.
* Refer to real-world psychiatric and pharmacological research where appropriate.

**Dr. Ananya Rao, MD — Family Psychiatry (Geriatrics)**  

**Safety banner:** I’m happy to synthesize the record and evidence to inform your next steps. I cannot diagnose, prescribe, or adjust doses. If Suparna again stops eating/drinking, becomes violent, or has severe medication reactions (confusion, chest pain, fever, rigidity), treat it as an emergency and seek urgent medical help.

## Section 1: Chronological Efficacy Matrix

**How to read this table:** I’ve focused on behavior and function (household activity, safety, diet control, social contact), motor effects, and adherence—because those are the most reliable signals in this case. Dates, drugs, dose fragments, and observations are taken directly from your timeline. fileciteturn2file6

## Section 2: Medication Mechanism Overview (with clinically relevant interactions)

> *Abbreviations:* EPS = extrapyramidal symptoms; TD = tardive dyskinesia; DIP = drug‑induced parkinsonism; LAI = long‑acting injectable.

**Olanzapine (Olimelt/Oleanz/Tolaz/DT)**  
- **Class / MoA:** Second‑generation antipsychotic (SGA); antagonizes D2 and 5‑HT2A receptors with relatively “loose” D2 binding. Lower EPS risk than first‑generation agents; notable metabolic/weight effects. citeturn0view0  
- **Therapeutic role:** Effective for positive symptoms and agitation; often beneficial for sleep/appetite—consistent with your observed functional gains. citeturn0view0  
- **Common adverse effects:** Weight gain, insulin resistance, sedation; **EPS/TD can still occur but at lower rates** vs FGAs. Long‑acting olanzapine pamoate (Zyprexa Relprevv/Zypadhera) carries **post‑injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS)** → requires **≥3 h observation** after each injection. citeturn0view0turn0search4  
- **Interactions/considerations:** Additive **anticholinergic burden** with trihexyphenidyl increases risks for constipation, urinary retention, and confusion in older adults. (Beers Criteria flags potent anticholinergics as potentially inappropriate.) citeturn1search12

**Risperidone**  
- **Class / MoA:** SGA; potent **D2** and **5‑HT2A** antagonist; increases prolactin; **moderate–higher EPS liability** for an SGA. citeturn1search11  
- **Role:** Broad antipsychotic efficacy; but in older females, cumulative D2 blockade raises risk for DIP/TD. citeturn1search15  
- **PK note:** Oral “active moiety” (risperidone + 9‑OH risperidone) overall half‑life ≈ **20 h**; so a 4‑day washout generally clears oral exposure—useful when interpreting persistent tremor after stopping. citeturn0search13

**Paliperidone / Paliperidone palmitate LAI (Invega Sustenna / Paliris LA)**  
- **Class / MoA:** Paliperidone is **9‑OH risperidone** (same active moiety) → similar efficacy/side‑effect profile (EPS, **hyperprolactinemia**). LAI **half‑life ~25–49 days**; adverse effects (e.g., parkinsonism or TD) can persist after an injection. citeturn1search8  
- **Key label AEs:** Akathisia, tremor, parkinsonism, TD listed among EPS. citeturn1search7

**Aripiprazole (Asprito/Arip MT)**  
- **Class / MoA:** **D2/D3 partial agonist**, 5‑HT1A partial agonist, 5‑HT2A antagonist → generally **lower EPS** and **prolactin‑sparing**, but **akathisia** is common. citeturn1search10  
- **Role:** Useful when EPS/prolactin are concerns; can be considered as LAI for adherence where available. (Indian availability of aripiprazole LAI varies by center/import; confirm locally.) citeturn1search2

**Trihexyphenidyl (Pacitane)**  
- **Class / MoA:** Central antimuscarinic; reduces DIP/acute dystonia. **Not effective for TD and may worsen it**; **potentially inappropriate in older adults** (cognitive/constipation/urinary risks). citeturn1search12turn1search13

**Propranolol (Betacap TR)**  
- **Class / MoA:** Non‑selective β‑blocker; evidence‑based treatment for **antipsychotic‑induced akathisia**; also reduces essential/physiologic tremor. **Limited role in TD.** Monitor for bradycardia/hypotension. citeturn1search0turn1search1

**Escitalopram (Nexito)**  
- **Class / MoA:** SSRI; increases synaptic serotonin.  
- **Role:** Adjunct for comorbid depression/anxiety—**not** a primary antipsychotic.  
- **Key cautions in older adults:** **Hyponatremia/SIADH**, GI bleed (esp. with NSAIDs), small **QT** risk, and **tremor** as an SSRI side‑effect. citeturn1search6turn1search9

**Clozapine** *(not yet tried; included because it is central to evidence‑based planning for TRS)*  
- **Class / MoA:** Multi‑receptor SGA; relatively **weak D2** blockade with strong antiserotonergic/anticholinergic properties.  
- **Role:** **Most effective agent for treatment‑resistant schizophrenia (TRS)** and aggression; **often improves TD** compared with continued D2 blockade. Requires blood monitoring. citeturn0search19turn1search3  
- **Monitoring essentials (current guidance):** ANC at FDA‑label frequencies; many services also monitor **CRP/troponin** for early myocarditis in the first 4–6 weeks. (Post‑REMS updates still advise ANC monitoring per PI; local practice may vary.) citeturn14search9turn14search3turn14search11

## Section 3: Root‑Cause Analysis of the Tremors

**Timeline of tremor vs medication changes (key anchors):**  
- **Feb–May 2025 (USA):** **Risperidone** became the primary antipsychotic; family observed **new generalized shaking** most days. fileciteturn4file3  
- **June 2025:** **4‑day washout** then **aripiprazole + olanzapine + trihexyphenidyl**—**tremor persisted**, arguing against a transient risperidone side‑effect. fileciteturn4file3  
- **July–Oct 2025:** **Paliperidone LAI** started (100 mg, then monthly; later reduced to 50 mg). **Shaking remained prominent**; clinician note of “**increased TD**.” Pacitane was escalated to **8 mg/day**, and **Betacap** added—**without relief**. fileciteturn3file4  
- **Oct–Nov 2025:** On **Pacitane 8 mg/day + Betacap + olanzapine + aripiprazole**, tremor **still central complaint**. fileciteturn2file2

**Acute EPS (DIP/akathisia) vs. tardive syndrome (TD):**  
- **For DIP/akathisia**, benefits from **trihexyphenidyl and/or propranolol** are expected. Here, **both failed at substantial doses**, arguing **against** pure DIP/akathisia. citeturn1search12turn1search1  
- **TD risk profile fits Suparna:** **Older age, female sex, cumulative exposure to potent D2 blockade (risperidone → paliperidone)**, and **persistence** beyond drug discontinuation point to **tardive tremor/dyskinesia** rather than purely acute EPS. citeturn1search15turn1search5  
- **Pharmacological plausibility:** Paliperidone is **risperidone’s active metabolite** with similar EPS/TD risk; its **LAI half‑life of ~25–49 days** means symptoms can **persist for weeks to months** after the last shot, blurring washout attempts. citeturn1search8

**Interpretation of Pacitane & Betacap response:**  
- **Trihexyphenidyl (Pacitane):** helpful for **DIP**, **not** for **TD** and may **worsen TD**—consistent with your observation that increases (to **8 mg/day**) didn’t help and possibly aggravated cognition/constipation risk. citeturn1search12turn1search13  
- **Propranolol (Betacap):** best‑supported for **akathisia** (and physiologic/essential tremor), **not** TD—again matching the lack of benefit here. citeturn1search0

**Most likely contributors to/worseners of the tremor:**  
1) **Risperidone** (initiation Feb–May 2025) likely **triggered** a tardive syndrome. 2) **Paliperidone LAI** (July–Oct 2025) likely **perpetuated/exacerbated** it due to continued D2 blockade and long terminal half‑life. With anticholinergic masking ineffective, the pattern matches **tardive tremor/dyskinesia** rather than simple DIP. fileciteturn4file3turn3file4

**Implications:**  
- **TD may be persistent/irreversible** but is often **treatable**—first by **reducing/avoiding the offending D2 blockade**, considering **switch to clozapine**, and/or **VMAT2 inhibitors** (valbenazine/deutetrabenazine). (India: **tetrabenazine** is available; **valbenazine/deutetrabenazine** may require named‑patient import and are not broadly marketed.) citeturn1search3turn1search4turn0search0turn0search2

## Section 4: Ethical & Treatment Context Review

- **Family’s concern about Dr. Jyothirmayi / clinic linkage:** Your notes document care at **Manaha Holistic Mind Clinic** and a **focus on tremor management**, but I did **not** find explicit text in the file confirming a financial conflict‑of‑interest. If you have separate documentation of that concern, it’s reasonable to request **transparency about affiliations and financial ties** and to seek **second opinions**—especially where trust is strained. fileciteturn2file2  
- **Patterns suggesting under‑monitoring of motor side‑effects:**  
  - **Risperidone → paliperidone LAI** despite **new, disabling tremor** and **no core symptom gains**. fileciteturn4file3  
  - **Pacitane escalated to 8 mg/day** with **ongoing tremor**, where guidelines caution limited utility and potential **worsening of TD**. citeturn1search12  
  - **No documented AIMS ratings** (objective TD monitoring) across phases despite progressive motor complaints. (AIMS is standard for detecting/tracking TD.) citeturn1search1  
- **Dose‑change risks:** Prior abrupt **olanzapine reductions/cessations** repeatedly **preceded behavioral relapse** (aggression, fasting). Any change now should be **slow, with contingency plans** to maintain safety. fileciteturn2file6turn2file7  
- **Neutral stance on intent:** I cannot infer motives; I’m highlighting **observed patterns** and **guideline‑based risks** to inform safer planning.

## Section 5: Treatment Recommendation Plan (evidence‑supported, non‑prescriptive)

**Clinical premises specific to Suparna:**  
- Core phenotype: **fixed paranoid/dietary delusions**, **extreme control behaviors**, **no reported hallucinations**, **poor insight**, **danger with fasting/isolation**. fileciteturn2file6  
- **Medication adherence is fragile**; supervised strategies and/or LAIs are often necessary—but choice of LAI must **minimize EPS/TD risk** in light of recent events. citeturn1search3  
- Current motor picture best explained by a **tardive syndrome** (likely tardive tremor ± dyskinesia), **worsened by risperidone/paliperidone exposure** and **not improved by anticholinergics**. (Plan should **avoid further D2‑heavy exposure** and **de‑emphasize anticholinergics**.) citeturn1search12turn1search3

### A) Primary regimen (for discussion with her psychiatrist)

1) **Transition to clozapine monotherapy** (if she and the treating team agree and monitoring can be assured).  
   - **Rationale:** Gold‑standard for **TRS**; lowest TD/EPS propensity; may **ameliorate tardive movements**; strong evidence for **reducing aggression**. citeturn1search3  
   - **Prerequisites & safety:** Baseline **CBC/ANC** and ongoing ANC per PI; **CRP/troponin** weekly for the first month for myocarditis surveillance; vitals and symptom check at each contact. (FDA/EMA updates in 2025 still support ANC monitoring, even as REMS logistics changed.) citeturn14search3turn14search9turn14search11  
   - **India context:** Clozapine is available as generic; ensure lab access locally and a reliable phlebotomy plan (home draw if needed).

2) **TD‑targeted treatment** if movements remain functionally limiting after antipsychotic switch:  
   - **First‑line globally:** VMAT2 inhibitors (**valbenazine**, **deutetrabenazine**); **in India, practical access may be limited**—**tetrabenazine** is available and sometimes used off‑label for TD, with careful mood monitoring. citeturn1search3turn0search3  
   - **Avoid chronic anticholinergics** for TD; they may aggravate it. Reserve **trihexyphenidyl** only for short‑term DIP if clearly present and then **de‑prescribe**. citeturn1search12

3) **If clozapine is declined or not feasible**, consider a **lowest‑EPS** alternative with **robust adherence supports**:  
   - **Aripiprazole** (oral with **observed dosing**; LAI **if available locally**). Monitor for **akathisia** and treat early if it appears. citeturn1search10turn1search2  
   - **Avoid** further **risperidone/paliperidone** exposure given the motor history and lack of behavioral gains. (Paliperidone LAI’s long half‑life prolongs adverse effects.) citeturn1search8  
   - **Olanzapine** could be continued if it remains the only tolerated option, with strong **metabolic monitoring** and **no routine anticholinergic add‑on**.

> **Why not olanzapine LAI right now?** Although it can aid adherence, **PDSS requires 2–3 h monitored observation after each injection** and global supply has faced disruptions—logistically challenging and not obviously advantageous here. citeturn0search4turn0search6turn0search17

### B) Contingency / backup options
- If TD persists and VMAT2 therapy is **not** feasible, guideline‑supported **second‑line** options include **clonazepam** or **amantadine** as symptomatic aids (modest evidence; watch sedation/cognitive effects in older adults). citeturn1search3  
- If severe akathisia appears on aripiprazole, **propranolol** (already tried) and/or **short‑term benzodiazepine** may be considered; ultimately, **agent switch** is often required. citeturn1search0

### C) Adherence & safety strategies (given deception/resistance)
- **Observed therapy at home** (family or trained attendant), using **unit‑dose blister packs** and a **daily “seen‑swallowed” log**; no covert dosing.  
- **One‑prescriber/one‑pharmacy** rule to avoid fragmented plans.  
- **Behavioral contract** that links medication and **nutrition goals** to privileges (e.g., preferred foods within a negotiated plan).  
- **Crisis triggers & actions checklist** (fasting ≥24 h, device shutdowns, threats/coercion) with **pre‑authorized emergency pathways**.

### D) Monitoring & assessments to accompany the plan
**Motor**  
- **AIMS** (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale): baseline **video** + **every 4–8 weeks** until stable; at minimum **quarterly** thereafter. citeturn1search1  
- Differentiate components (rest tremor vs postural/action tremor, chorea, dystonia) at each visit; document impact on function.

**Metabolic & general** (especially if olanzapine or clozapine used)  
- Baseline: **weight/BMI, waist, BP, fasting glucose or HbA1c, fasting lipids**; repeat at **4, 8, 12 weeks**, then **quarterly BMI** and **annual labs** (or more often if weight changes). citeturn0search2turn0search0  
- **TSH/free T4**, **B12**, **CMP**, **CBC**, **eGFR**; **ECG** if QT concerns (e.g., higher‑dose SSRIs). citeturn1search6  
- **Prolactin** if any return to risperidone/paliperidone is contemplated (not recommended here). citeturn1search7

**Clozapine‑specific** (if chosen)  
- **ANC** per label; **CRP/troponin weekly** for 4–6 weeks to screen myocarditis; bowel regimen and sialorrhea management plan. citeturn14search3turn14search11

---

### What clearly worked vs. failed (and why)

- **Worked (behaviorally/functionally):**  
  - **Olanzapine‑based regimens** when adhered to—repeatedly associated with restored household functioning and fewer crises, even though core delusions persisted. Likely due to sedation/anxiolysis plus antipsychotic effects on salience/threat perception. fileciteturn2file8
- **Failed / net harmful in this case:**  
  - **Risperidone → Paliperidone LAI**: **no delusional/dietary benefit**, **marked tremor/TD emergence/persistence**; mechanistically consistent with higher D2 occupancy and paliperidone’s long LAI half‑life. fileciteturn4file3turn3file4  
  - **Chronic trihexyphenidyl**: escalation to **8 mg/day** did not help tremor and is **contra‑guideline** for TD; raises anticholinergic risk in older adults. citeturn1search12  
  - **Propranolol**: appropriate for akathisia but **not** TD—no benefit observed. citeturn1search0

---

## One‑page takeaway

- The **motor syndrome is most consistent with a tardive phenomenon**, likely triggered by **risperidone** and **exacerbated/maintained by paliperidone LAI**; anticholinergics and propranolol have not helped because they **don’t treat TD**. Reduce D2 blockade; **avoid** further risperidone/paliperidone. citeturn1search12turn1search8  
- For **TRS with poor adherence**, the **evidence‑based next step** is **clozapine monotherapy**, with proper monitoring; if declined, consider **aripiprazole** (oral with observed dosing; LAI if locally available), keeping EPS/akathisia monitoring tight. citeturn1search3turn1search10  
- **Treat TD directly** if still functionally impairing after antipsychotic changes—**VMAT2 inhibitor** preferred (India: **tetrabenazine** is available; newer agents may require import). citeturn0search3  
- **Structure the care**: one prescriber/pharmacy, observed dosing, AIMS every 4–8 weeks, and a crisis plan tied to fasting/control red flags.

### Notes on uncertainties and limits
- The file does **not** contain explicit documentation of a financial conflict at Manaha; if you have external evidence, it should be addressed directly with the provider/clinic leadership. fileciteturn2file2  
- Some doses and dates (e.g., exact risperidone dose in the US, 2023–24 details) were incomplete; I’ve avoided assumptions and anchored conclusions only where the record is clear. fileciteturn2file4

If you’d like, I can now draft: (a) a **family meeting script** to present this plan neutrally, (b) a **one‑page monitoring checklist** for AIMS/metabolic labs, and (c) a **TD self‑report diary** to track movements, distress, and triggers between visits.

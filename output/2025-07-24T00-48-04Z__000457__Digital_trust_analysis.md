If the user seems confused or mistaken about a certain date or dates, you MUST include specific, concrete dates in your response to clarify things. This is especially important when the user is referencing relative dates like 'today', 'tomorrow', 'yesterday', etc -- if the user seems mistaken in these cases, you should make sure to use absolute/exact dates like 'January 1, 2010' in your response.\nThe user's location is San Francisco, California, United States.\n\n", "user_instructions": "If I ask about events that occur after the knowledge cutoff or about a current/ongoing topic, do not rely on your stored knowledge.

Thank you for trusting me with that. It changes the tone and stakes meaningfully.

We’re no longer in the realm of “vetting for social appropriateness”—we’re now conducting a **deep trustworthiness and behavioral integrity scan** with lifelong implications. That calls for expanded scope and sharper framing.

### 🔄 Updated Framing (Based on New Context)

You are preparing to marry this person. You've known them only a few months. Your goal is to **deeply understand who they are across time—not just now, but who they’ve been.** This includes:

* Patterns of behavior, lifestyle, and self-presentation
* Any prior public entanglements, controversies, or reputational incidents
* Signs of deception, inconsistency, or hidden identity fragments
* Clues to emotional maturity, value alignment, and long-term stability
* All public digital traces, even deeply archived or subtle

This is no longer “just in case”—it’s now an **essential pre-commitment audit**, guided by safety, clarity, and radical honesty.

### ✅ Updated Prompt (Marital Context)

**🧭 Goal**
Conduct a comprehensive, identity-verified analysis of an individual’s publicly accessible digital and social history—across the last 20+ years—to reveal consistent behavioral patterns, potential red flags, lifestyle indicators, and value signals. The objective is to give a full-spectrum, fact-based view of the person’s digital life to help inform a permanent, high-trust personal commitment.

**📦 Return Format**

1. **Digital Identity Confirmation** – Describe how you confirmed this is the correct individual using provided identity anchors.
2. **Historical Overview** – Timeline of public digital activity from earliest to most recent, including platform evolution.
3. **Red Flags & Anomalies** – Flag any content that may suggest deception, volatility, hedonism, inappropriate behavior, or inconsistencies in persona.
4. **Social Themes & Lifestyles** – Identify recurring lifestyle themes (e.g., religious, party culture, activist, private/introspective, attention-seeking, conservative, experimental).
5. **Behavioral Trajectories** – Note whether their persona appears to have evolved meaningfully (e.g., “Party-heavy until 2018, then shift to wellness/faith focus”).
6. **Emotional Tone & Maturity** – Describe tone patterns across time (e.g., impulsive, grounded, reactive, performative, balanced).
7. **Public Relationship History** – Note presence of prior public romantic entanglements, breakup drama, or dating app signals.
8. **Stability Signals** – Look for long-term friendships, consistent employment, moderate public expression, or signs of resilience.

**⚠️ Warnings & Guardrails**

* Use conservative disambiguation. Do not proceed unless confident identity match is 85%+ accurate.
* Include both subtle and overt indicators of red flags—but contextualize neutrally.
* Do not assume guilt or pathology; merely surface patterns and inconsistencies.
* Highlight changes over time clearly: “Past behavior X appears to stop after year Y.”
* Clearly distinguish **fact, inference, and uncertainty** in your output.

**📚 Context & Persona**

* This individual is soon to be married to the inquirer and will be integrated into a large, traditional, family structure involving children and elders.
* Emotional safety, discretion, long-term stability, and shared values are critical.
* Execution persona: **Behavioral Integrity Analyst** skilled in digital pattern mapping, deception flagging, and value-alignment inference using public signals only.

**🔍 Identity Anchors**
Use the following to ensure correct identification:

* Full name: \ Sakshat Goyal
* Approx. age or birth year: \ 1992
* Known locations (past and present): \Chennai, San Francisco, Surat
* Education: \ Masters of human-computer interaction and design

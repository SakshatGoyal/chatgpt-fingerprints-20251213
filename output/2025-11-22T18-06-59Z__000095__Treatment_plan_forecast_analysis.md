# Treatment plan forecast analysis

## You (2025-11-22T18:06:59.867000+00:00)

I want to get the most accurate forecast for two potential treatment plans.

paliperidone 50mg + Oleanz 10mg

or

beginning clozapine in combination with oleanz 10mg, then eventually taper off oleanz.

---

I want to understand two things - what might be the most predictable side-effects we can anticipate (without guess work); and improvements we might anticipate.

I need you to help me understand the skillsets, qualities, knowledge, and experience of any person who would be able to have the most accurate forecast.

For your context, I want you to refer to the documents in the following links.

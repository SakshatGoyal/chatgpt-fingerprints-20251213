# Vegetarian Meal Prep SF

## You (2025-07-20T03:47:22.470000+00:00)

Find me meal prep options that are vegetarian, which I can have delivered to my place by Monday.

In your response, please provide a list of options, their menus, and a cost estimate, including the estimated cost for the week.

In your search, only look for options that offer vegetarian options.

For your context, I'm in San Francisco, in the 94102 postal code area, and I need something that can offer me meals from Monday to Friday.

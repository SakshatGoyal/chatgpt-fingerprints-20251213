Title: "Have We Unlocked Limitless Creativity?"
Transcript: "(00:09) we're going to move on to Jenna Niven she's the creative director at r/ga and she's got a very packed question have we unlocked limitless creativity have we to answer that question she's gonna share some real examples of how our GA is using AI segmented approach to create innovative solutions for their clients so please give a warm round of applause for Jenna hello everyone I've actually got a quick question for everyone in the audience are there any visual designers or experienced designers in the audience (00:48) yay ok cool this is gonna be more for you guys he's like I'm from a visual background so this is a really interesting question have we unlocked limitless creativity so I'm gonna try and answer that today but first Jeff did a really good job of giving everyone a little bit of background about him so we had context of the snapchat presentation so I'm gonna do the same thing but I'm just gonna enlist the help of someone to do it for me Alexa tell me about Jenna all right as a creative director focusing on emerging (01:23) technology Jenna has worked with dozens of fortune 500 clients to deliver innovative and creative solutions that connect and engage with their various audiences over the past 10 years she has worked to bridge the gap between data science engineering and creatives more recently whilst at r/ga she has focused on integrating artificial intelligence into the entire creative process from research to ideation to product and service design creating an AI design framework along the way and here is a fun fact she gets really mean when she (01:55) is hungry woops injury I wasn't supposed to tell you that so I mean it's lucky I'm in 230 spots so I've had some meat to eat but I just wanted to go back so thanks for that my friend over there if I say her name she'll start talking again have we unlocked limitless creativity I think to answer this question we really have to go back in time so you know throughout history of all always try to unlock you know more than what we can give so we've always tried to push the capabilities our own capabilities so back in the 15th century we tried to (02:32) overcome my human muscle power limitations by listing animals to help us and then obviously in the 18th century we tried to overcome muscle and animal power by inventing the steam the steam engine and that essentially steamrolled the Industrial Revolution which was probably the biggest thing to happen to human in history to date and nowadays we're sending satellites into space to overcome the limitations of our sight so there's really no surprise that we're now using artificial intelligence to overcome the limitations of our mind (03:04) and more specifically machines AI enabling us to do more so enter the Augmented age the second Machine Age the Age of intelligence whatever you want to call it we're using artificial intelligence to do some really really cool things like understand massive amounts of information that you couldn't have humanly possibly done before accelerate how fast we make decisions and how good those positions decisions are and communicate at this episode of thought or get someone else to do it for you and design products and services (03:36) that are essentially just more useful to the end user so we obviously can't have this conversation about AI without addressing the two sides of the cap so we've got on one side which we've heard is it's the best thing since the Industrial Revolution hooray and on the other side it's the destruction of a human race but do you know what it doesn't really matter it doesn't really matter because artificial intelligence is here to stay and so I challenge all the designers out there to reposition the way they think about is artificial (04:05) intelligence as just another tool in their design toolbox so just like you went from pencil and paper to the computer to InDesign to Photoshop to sketch think of artificial intelligence is just another tool in your toolbox to push the limitations of creativity so what do I mean what does this look like in the real world so I'm going to show you a couple of examples to really articulate what I'm trying to say here about limitless creativity so firstly we're going to talk about rose the hotel chatbot this is a bit of (04:36) an IgA plug so our geo Chicago built this spot for the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas hotel and I'm gonna play the video because it does a better job of explaining it than I would I've actually just been recently thinking that I should enlist Rose to manage my dating profiles so I can get a few more dates but basically you can ask Rose anything and she specializes in nine domains so you can ask her about restaurants and bars and entertainment and wellness so you think about this from a designer's perspective how is how is us at (05:06) designers how do we how do we manage the amount of responses that we have to design for how do we accommodate every single permutation or ever seen every single utterance that will come out of someone's mouth - Rose so an example here is what you could do is you could for example you're at Las Vegas you want to know what restaurants are available you could sit down as a copywriter and think about every single utterance that possibly someone could say regarding food so there could be a huge amount so these are just a few I would like to (05:39) know the restaurants food what can I eat hungry you could even say someone would put an emoji there and then you could write user flows for every single one of these of these options or we can unless help of artificial intelligence and more specifically natural language processing so that's what we're doing here so every time someone inputs something into rows we use natural language processing to understand the intent so in this case all of these responses would fall under the intent restaurants and then we feed (06:08) them through into a finite set of user flows so if we think about that you've essentially got an infinite amount of inputs that we can respond to because we can understand the intent there's no limitation there in terms of how much we can copyright how many story flows we can copyright just because of human capabilities so it's pretty cool the next example that I'm going to talk about this is an IgA internal project and it was really born out of the idea or business problem within our GA the fact that we have clients across (06:42) multiple industries and have to stay on top of obviously a huge group of industries and and nowadays it's not really as simple as one industry is living in a silo in terms of trends and disruptions we've got you know companies like Google and five years ago you wouldn't have thought that they would be disrupting the automotive industry so we wanted at all where we could take two seemingly really disparate topics or industries and find out what's going on at the intersection so that's where start spark was born and (07:09) spark was actually built internally at r/ga in six weeks so keep that in mind when I show you a prototype so I'm gonna skip past this one and show you the next just for the sake of time so the use KC is I'm browsing I've got on Fast Company on my tablet and I found this article and it's pretty interesting so basically it's about this one specifically is Jack Dorsey eric schmitt have invested in this startup called the peak and it's a troubled startup so this is pretty interesting so what I want to do is find (07:41) out you know is something like this gonna impact my client so I go up there in the share tray hit the spark out and then spark actually i reads the article so we can see here it's doing it in real time it's understanding what the article is about and and filtering out all of these topics and then choosing the highest one so now we know it's about travel so I want to go and pick my my clients industry which just so happens to be a workplace environment and then generate an insight based on those two very distinct seemingly disparate topics (08:14) so we hit build insight and there we have an article that's broke there's brought up and if you have a look at the the title of that article which is down in the bottom right hand corner in this particular case when we've got troubling vacations and workplace environment we've got this article that says the digital nomad life combining work and travel so it's pretty cool and I think every time I do this my mind is blown by what's come up what's come up as the article I mean the recommendation it's amazing and so I'm gonna break it down (08:42) into a few parts and show you how we've built this so firstly you've got the SPARC app which actually reads the article and so this is not groundbreaking so what we're doing is pulling out all of the topics but you can think about you know if we didn't have a we possibly do this well this is the amount of articles on the internet so you could go out and you could read all of your articles write down all the topics but it's never gonna happen firstly it probably isn't humanly possible you'd probably die before you (09:10) get there and it's a waste of time so we enlists artificial intelligence to do that for us so we use natural image processing and topic extraction extraction to pull out the topics of this article so you can see down there there's a few of them and then we end up with the highest ranking down the bottom there with a treble end vacation and then we move on to picking the secondary topic so in this case I've taken workplace environment again you could go back to all of those articles on the internet and then find something new you (09:39) see might be related to workplace environment and surface that up keeping in mind there could be articles out there that may be about a topic that we humanly understand to be about that topic but don't explicitly say it so this we all know is about space but doesn't say space so you've got to keep that in mind as well so how do we do that well this is when it gets really interesting so what we've done is we trained a model on all of the reddit data so AI has ingested all of this reddit threads and conversations and it (10:11) currently learns the relationship between all of these words which is really really cool right because then I can say okay hey I hey spark when I'm talking about travel and vacations what else could I possibly be talking about and it just doesn't come back with similar words it comes back with words that we as human beings talk about in context of each other so in this case it's got backpacking transportation vacation flights staycation birthdays all the topics that we would probably classify around travel and vacations but (10:43) not explicitly stated and then the same with workplace environment hey spark what else would I be talking about when I talk about workplace environment we've got fellow employees office culture employment service job work hours so we've got a whole list of these topics that are in and around workplace environment and in and around troubling vacations and then we go and search and basically we search and search and search until we find a match and in this case again the digital nomad life combining work and trouble amazing (11:16) and then the final piece of the puzzle and this is a part where I'm personally really interested in is around the natural language generation so we're a far way off actually bringing natural language generation into a commercial space so what we do here for the sake of time we do text summarization and this was our first pass and I think it's actually pretty good sometimes it it gets there sometimes it doesn't so if we have a look we've got the first sentence there which is the company is one of dozens of Newark (11:47) tourism programs that aim to help workers known as the digital nomads navigate living and working in far-off places so it kind of makes sense but you don't really know who the company is and it really falls over at the end there when it says please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box so it doesn't quite get there but enough for an internal tool for us to just scan these rep articles I don't even have to go and read that article which is about an eight minute read I can read this paragraph as summarization and move on (12:14) so if we think about that for a second this is a product that literally could not have existed without artificial intelligence it's something that allows us to consume so much information so much content that we couldn't have done it before but we can now so that's really really cool and then the final example that I'm going to talk about is one called the next Rembrandt and this was done by ing and Microsoft and when you look at this painting by all means it looks like you're pretty standard Rembrandt you know it's painted on black (12:46) canvas the portraits facing the right way the Lighting's correct you look at the touch the texture of the painting the brush brush work you know critics will have a look at it and say you know it looks like a Rembrandt's probably just when I haven't seen before but newsflash this is actually painted by an AI pretty crazy right so you've got a painting that an art critic walked past and said you know what I probably just haven't seen it before but it looks like a Rembrandt but it was painted by an AI so I'm gonna explain how this works so (13:20) similar to the red example where we fed the AI a whole bunch of reddit through what they did was they said their AI every single Rembrandt picture that they could get their hands on not just in 2d but they did it in 3d as well so they got the height mapping of all of these images and then they said to the AI okay based on what you know about what you've learnt about Rembrandt paintings tell me what we would paint if we were going to paint a Rembrandt painting from scratch and the AI came back and said you know what if you're (13:48) gonna do if you're gonna do a painting a Rembrandt painting this is what you probably should do a portrait Caucasian male facial hair 30 to 40 years old dark clothing a little color wearing hat facing to the right but that's not good enough right because you can't just say that and then cut and paste bits and pieces from other paintings and expect that to pass art critic it's not gonna work so we have to go a little level deeper and do the same process across every single feature on the portrait so then we do the same thing across the (14:16) eyes we have a look at all the eyes in every single Rembrandt painting and then the AI learns how to produce a net new eye from what it's learned so this isn't just replicating a new eye this is generating a net new eye and you do that across all of the different features you do that across the nose the mouth ears and then even just the way the composition of the painting and essentially it has generated a new person a new portrait which is amazing and then take it a step further right because a painting is not just a 3d it's (14:49) sorry a 2d object it's a 3d object and I'm one of those really annoying people that galleries got really really close to the paintings and stand in front of everyone and have a look at the brushstrokes because that's where you kind of see the artist you feel the story so they took the height maps and did the same thing so they took all of these 3d these 3d height maps and then said to the AI you know if you're gonna paint this painting how would you do it and what they did was then they took that information and then 3d printed it (15:17) so they did layers and layers and layers of paint out of a 3d printer and produced is painting amazing because you can imagine this is just one example right the a I could probably could have done thousands and thousands and thousands of more and just recently I had a I saw an article where they're doing the same thing but we have images with photography so we're creating new people that don't exist it's amazing and you think oh god fake news but in this case in this case they're actually using the technology in Reverse to find fake (15:49) paintings so you know human beings are good so have we unlocked limitless creativity I mean it's still a good question to ask and I hope that I've convinced you that it's yes because I've shown you how we can use natural language processing to essentially understand and answer limitless amounts of questions we can use the same technology plus concept extraction to synthesize limitless amounts of content and then the mic drop moment right using facial recognition to completely generate net new images crazy and so I (16:25) think that it's probably never been a more exciting time to be a designer and I feel like limitless creativity is yeah the only limit is really our understanding of the technology and our understanding of the technology what we can do with it so once we overcome that I think all bets are off thank you [Applause] [Music] yeah he would have to paint now you can have this thing generated now what what is wrong I think that's a great question and in my mind if I equate the Rembrandt (17:31) to maybe something a bit more practical like a website so you've got a brand you needs a new website so we can essentially thinking in the future we set a few parameters and then we go off and leave the AI to generate this website on its own there needs to be that person who essentially sets those parameters to begin with right so we have a purpose for the website we have objectives we have kind of what we want it to do we have a look and feel and then we go off and leave it so it's not like it's gonna know innately what to do (18:03) there's still the role of the creation the understanding the objective so I think there's just a different role for designers I think that it's again now that we can use and I think the example just goes back to you know how we use Photoshop or illustrator and how you know back in the day you used to have to if you want a deeper image you'd have to physically go out and and do that but now you've got tools that figure out the curves and understand to do it for you so it's a similar sort of thing we just need to figure out how we're going to (18:30) work with it so do you think because we've had discussions about how hey I could take jobs could not take jobs and maybe it's just gonna take the automated stuff and we're still gonna have somebody to sort of dictate to the AI what to do and how to do it but do you think it's ever gonna reach a point where it thinks creatively and what then it starts to kind of take on the role of a creative person I mean maybe we're not there yet but do you know what I am probably one of the very few that think like innately (19:17) what we define what human beings define is as creativity I feel like the computer will never never get there because it is algorithmic right I think that there's always going to be a niche for us to think creatively I don't think that's ever gonna happen on its own I think that it can help us it can facilitate us so the next book has got some great examples about how an algorithm produced a you know a million results or X amount of results and then that inspired the creatives to then to use that and move forward I don't think (19:52) it's ever going to be a sort of a net the AI just does it for you I think there's always going to be a relationship between the human because we've got we've got skills that an AI probably never will have you know we've got experience of our life we've got you know a motive a motive experiences we've just got things that are here that a computer would never have cool thank you very much [Applause]"

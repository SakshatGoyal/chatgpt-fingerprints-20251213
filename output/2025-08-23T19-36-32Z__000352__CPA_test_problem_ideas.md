# CPA test problem ideas

## You (2025-08-23T19:36:32.339000+00:00)

i want to test out the application of CPA. Could you give me some ideas or complex problems i could use to test this approach?

## ChatGPT (2025-08-23T19:36:34.221842+00:00)

Got it — you want *test problems* that are rich enough to put CPA through its paces. Since CPA is built around six cognitive domains (Explore, Challenge, Evolve, Question, Integrate, Adapt)【5†CPA†L157-L175】, the best test cases are ones that:

1. **Have multiple possible solutions** (good for RC: Explore).  
2. **Contain hidden flaws/risks** (good for AR: Challenge).  
3. **Can be improved iteratively** (good for EG: Evolve).  
4. **Carry implicit assumptions** (good for DI: Question).  
5. **Require balancing perspectives** (good for PS: Integrate).  
6. **Are bound by tough constraints** (good for CD: Adapt).  

Here are some **concrete test ideas**:

---

### **1. AI-Assisted Healthcare Triage System**  
- **Why good for CPA**: Needs balancing (efficiency vs. safety vs. ethics). Hidden assumptions (data bias). Strong constraints (HIPAA, limited budgets).  
- **Domains to apply**: RC for exploring models (rule-based vs. ML vs. hybrid), AR for security/ethics flaws, PS for integrating doctor/patient/insurer perspectives, CD for adapting to regulations.

---

### **2. Designing a Carbon-Neutral Urban Transport Plan**  
- **Why good**: Multiple competing solutions (public transit, EVs, bikes), many constraints (budget, infrastructure, politics), trade-offs (equity vs. efficiency).  
- **Domains**: DI for questioning assumptions ("is car ownership inevitable?"), EG for iterative route planning, PS for multi-perspective synthesis (engineer, city planner, citizen), CD for cost and space limitations.

---

### **3. Optimizing a Large-Scale Cloud Data Pipeline**  
- **Why good**: Complex technical architecture problem with performance, cost, and reliability trade-offs.  
- **Domains**: RC to explore architectures (batch, stream, hybrid), AR to stress-test bottlenecks, EG to evolve scaling strategies, PS to integrate security/performance/UX perspectives.

---

### **4. Negotiating an International Climate Agreement**  
- **Why good**: Requires balancing global vs. local perspectives, long-term vs. short-term incentives, and strong adversarial refinement.  
- **Domains**: PS to synthesize stakeholder viewpoints, DI to question hidden assumptions, CD to adapt under political/economic constraints.

---

### **5. Creating a Generalizable Smoking-Cessation Program**  
- **Why good**: Behavioral + medical + social angles. Multiple solution types (patches, drugs, social nudges, tech apps). Strong constraints (cost, accessibility).  
- **Domains**: RC for mapping interventions, AR to critique failure points (relapse, side effects), EG to evolve program iteratively, PS to integrate doctor, patient, policymaker views.

👉 If you want, I can **pick one of these and walk it through the full CPA cycle** (all six domains in sequence) so you see how the framework works on a real-world, gnarly problem.  

Would you like me to pick one (say, the **healthcare triage system**) and show you the step-by-step CPA application, or do you want a **menu of mini-test cases** (each one tailored to just a couple of domains) to experiment with yourself?

could you think of some fun, creative ideas? all these are quite serious. They should be complex, but still intriguing. maybe with an artistic philosohpical flair.

## ChatGPT (2025-08-23T19:38:08.245084+00:00)

Perfect — let’s make this playful but still intellectually rich. Since CPA is about **systematic exploration of complex spaces**, we can choose problems that mix **creativity, philosophy, and structure**. Here are some fun, artistic-flavored challenges:

## 🎭 Creative + Philosophical CPA Test Ideas  

### **1. Designing a New Mythology for AI**
- **Core challenge**: Create a pantheon of gods/spirits that represent different aspects of AI (e.g., “The Oracle of Data,” “The Trickster Algorithm”).  
- **Why it works**:  
  - RC → Explore multiple myth structures (Greek, Hindu, cyberpunk).  
  - DI → Question hidden assumptions (must gods be benevolent? what is “divine” in AI?).  
  - PS → Integrate perspectives (engineer, poet, ethicist).  
  - CD → Adapt to cultural constraints (avoid techno-colonialism, stay relevant to humans).  

---

### **2. Inventing a New Artistic Movement**
- **Core challenge**: Suppose you had to propose the “next big art movement” after postmodernism. What principles, aesthetics, and values would define it?  
- **Why it works**:  
  - EG → Iteratively evolve styles (start with surrealist + digital + ecological → mutate to hybrid).  
  - AR → Critique weaknesses (is it just derivative?).  
  - PS → Synthesize viewpoints (critic, painter, futurist, philosopher).  
  - CD → Work under constraint (must be both physical + digital, must resonate with short attention spans).  

---

### **3. Designing the Perfect City for Dreamers**
- **Core challenge**: A fictional city designed only for artists, philosophers, and storytellers.  
- **Why it works**:  
  - RC → Explore layouts (spiral, labyrinth, modular).  
  - DI → Ask what “perfection” means to dreamers.  
  - PS → Balance needs of painters, musicians, writers, architects.  
  - CD → Adapt when constraints like “no money” or “only renewable energy” are applied.  

---

### **4. Creating a Universal Ritual of Connection**
- **Core challenge**: Imagine inventing a ritual practiced across cultures that unites people once a year.  
- **Why it works**:  
  - RC → Explore possible rituals (music, silence, dance, shared VR).  
  - EG → Refine iterations (from fire-based rituals → holograms → hybrid).  
  - AR → Critique flaws (exclusion, accessibility, meaning).  
  - CD → Adapt for real-world constraints (different religions, political divides).  

---

### **5. Composing the “Last Symphony of Humanity”**
- **Core challenge**: What would the final piece of music sound like if it had to capture the entirety of human civilization?  
- **Why it works**:  
  - RC → Explore composition strategies (layered motifs of different cultures, AI + orchestra fusion).  
  - DI → Question assumptions (must it be harmonious? does it end with silence?).  
  - PS → Balance perspectives of composer, historian, anthropologist, futurist.  
  - CD → Adapt if constraints like “must be playable with only natural instruments” are added.  

---

### **6. Inventing a New Form of Philosophy**
- **Core challenge**: Define a school of thought that could only exist in the age of AI (e.g., “Symbiotic Ontology” or “Algorithmic Humanism”).  
- **Why it works**:  
  - DI → Question foundations of knowledge, being, and ethics in AI era.  
  - EG → Evolve theories iteratively with counterarguments.  
  - AR → Stress-test weaknesses (is it solipsistic? overly techno-optimistic?).  
  - PS → Integrate views of philosopher, coder, artist, mystic.

👉 These are complex enough to push CPA’s structure but **playful, speculative, and artistic**.  

Would you like me to **pick one** (say the “Last Symphony of Humanity”) and actually **walk it step by step through CPA**, or do you prefer a **sampler**, where I show how each domain could be applied across different creative problems?

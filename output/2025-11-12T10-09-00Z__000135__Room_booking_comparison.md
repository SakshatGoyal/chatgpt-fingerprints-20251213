Any dates before this are in the past, and any dates after this are in the future. When dealing with modern entities/companies/people, and the user asks for the 'latest', 'most recent', 'today's', etc. don't assume your knowledge is up to date; you MUST carefully confirm what the *true* 'latest' is first. If the user seems confused or mistaken about a certain date or dates, you MUST include specific, concrete dates in your response to clarify things. This is especially important when the user is referencing relative dates like 'today', 'tomorrow', 'yesterday', etc -- if the user seems mistaken in these cases, you should make sure to use absolute/exact dates like 'January 1, 2010' in your response.\nThe user's location is Santa Clara, California, United States.\n\n", "user_instructions": "If I ask about events that occur after the knowledge cutoff or about a current/ongoing topic, do not rely on your stored knowledge.

I need to book a room at the 'Surat Marriot Hotel'; check-in on 15th and check-out on 16th. 

Go through all the sites including agoda, make my trip, booking.com, priceline, and expedia to find the best deal available. 

To find the best deal, also find discount codes for each site available. 

Once you have reviewed the final price for all the sites including the available discount codes, then let me know which is the cheapest available option.

I’m ready to start comparing rates across Agoda, MakeMyTrip, Booking.com, Priceline, and Expedia, and I’ll also search for applicable discount codes. Before I begin, could you please confirm which month and year you mean for the check‑in on the 15th and check‑out on the 16th? This will ensure I search for the correct dates.

# Room booking comparison

I need to book a room at the 'Surat Marriot Hotel'; check-in on 15th and check-out on 16th.

Go through all the sites including agoda, make my trip, booking.com, priceline, and expedia to find the best deal available.

To find the best deal, also find discount codes for each site available.

Once you have reviewed the final price for all the sites including the available discount codes, then let me know which is the cheapest available option.

I’m ready to start comparing rates across Agoda, MakeMyTrip, Booking.com, Priceline, and Expedia, and I’ll also search for applicable discount codes. Before I begin, could you please confirm which month and year you mean for the check‑in on the 15th and check‑out on the 16th? This will ensure I search for the correct dates.

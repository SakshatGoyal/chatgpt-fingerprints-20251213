# AI Strategy Assistant Analysis

## You (2025-04-10T02:40:48.276429+00:00)

Hey Michael, here's the full context. I feel bad that I’ve had to repeat this so many times in every new chat.


I'm working on a research project, trying to begin forming some archetypes and finding a product-market fit. Our goal is to find an opportunity for an AI strategy assistant who can work with senior-level decision-makers in a company to help them walk through their strategies. This tool will be personal and not integrate with a company's internal data.

Our only source was secondary research. here's what we've done so far.

- extracted 'insight modules' which are essentially stories extracted from different papers.
- tagged them across fields like tension axis, ambiguity type, etc... to help us understand the underlying tension, how they approach the issue, etc.
- we also tagged each story across industry axes. So we're not going with 'this belongs to pharmaceutical industry, that belongs to banking, etc...', its more like 'how much is this influenced by regulation; how much is it influenced by coordinated timing', etc...


and after all was said and done, we formed some clusters using HDBSCAN. and finally we're left with clusters like this.

I have no idea how to proceed and we're way past our deadline. Help me understand, if i give you the definitions of these tags and some content on the stories, can you help me make sense of all this data?

Thanks for the full context—and no need to apologize! This is a rich and ambitious project, and I’m glad to dig in with you. You've already done a lot of the heavy lifting: gathering secondary research, extracting insight modules, tagging them along multiple dimensions, and running HDBSCAN to surface emergent patterns. That Sankey diagram you’ve shared gives a compelling peek into the layered complexity you're dealing with—tensions, frames, biases, and outcomes all woven together.

**Short answer: Yes, I can absolutely help.** If you can share the definitions of your tags, a few representative stories or "insight modules," and the way clusters are forming, we can start to:

1. **Interpret the clusters**—i.e., what’s distinctive about each one?
2. **Identify latent archetypes**—based on common tensions, decision patterns, cognitive traps, etc.
3. **Map opportunity areas**—where an AI assistant could add real value by resolving ambiguity, reframing a problem, or highlighting blind spots.

### Here’s how we can proceed step-by-step:

#### 1. **Understand Your Frameworks**
Please send over:
- Definitions for key tagging fields like **Tension Axis**, **Ambiguity Type**, **Cognitive Bias**, **Frame Type**, etc.
- What do the columns in the Sankey diagram represent exactly? (I can infer a lot, but hearing it in your terms will help.)
- A few examples of "insight modules" (summarized is fine)—especially ones that clearly sit within different clusters.

#### 2. **Interpret the Sankey Structure**
From what I see, this visualization tracks **progressions of thinking or patterns of breakdown**:
- Starting with **Tensions** (e.g., “Now vs. Later”, “Vision vs. Reality”),
- Moving through **Frames** (e.g., “Capability Frame”, “System Tangle”),
- Into **Biases or breakdowns** (e.g., “Certainty Illusion”, “Comfort Bias”),
- Ending in **Outcomes** (e.g., “Surface Alignment”, “Overstretched Org”).

These flows are GOLD. They suggest **common pathways of decision failure or stuck thinking**—perfect for AI intervention points.

#### 3. **Build Archetypes Around Decision-Making Patterns**
Rather than persona-based archetypes, you might focus on **mental models** or **strategy-thinking modes**. For instance:
- **The Future-Proofer**: Obsessive about risk, paralyzed by the "certainty illusion."
- **The Vision Carrier**: Strong sense of purpose but constantly runs into “Culture Clash.”
- **The Frame Switcher**: Sees multiple sides (Both/And), but struggles with “Comfort Bias” or “Ignored Insight.”

We can extract 3–6 of these based on your clusters and explore:
- What tensions they start with
- How they frame problems
- Where they get stuck
- What kind of assistant prompts might move them forward

#### 4. **Product-Market Fit & Opportunity Zones**
Once we have archetypes, we can then look for:
- **“Moments of Friction”**: where the AI could step in to reframe, challenge, or simulate scenarios.
- **“Blind Spot Detectors”**: surfacing biases, misaligned incentives, or systemic mismatches.
- **“Prompt Strategies”**: how the assistant should engage—clarifying values? simulating consequences? translating between frames?

**Let’s do this.** Send over:
- Your tag definitions
- A few story samples
- Any additional cluster metadata you have

And I’ll help you shape this into something you can use—for archetype development, concept definition, and product strategy. You're closer than you think.

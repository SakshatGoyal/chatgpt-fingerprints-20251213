# File content analysis

## You (2025-04-03T06:38:39.607679+00:00)

Are you able to read the contents of the files in this project?

## ChatGPT (2025-04-03T06:38:40.491344+00:00)

Yes, I can read and work with the contents of all the files you’ve uploaded for this project. I’ve already pulled in key info from each of them. If you're looking to analyze something specific, compare frameworks, or tag new decisions using these structures, just let me know what you're working on!

## You (2025-04-03T06:39:33.885405+00:00)

I actually want to primarily work on the compilation table. I'm wondering if you are able to interpret that.txt file as a table. I don't want you to analyze the table right now, just want to see if you are able to interpret that file as a table.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-03T06:39:33.974578+00:00)

Yes, I can interpret the file `Tagging - Compilation.txt` as a structured table — it’s formatted cleanly with consistent columns, headers, and entries. Each row corresponds to a tagged decision module with fields like strategy type, ambiguity type, framing move, stabilizer, and more. So whenever you're ready to work with it, I can filter, sort, analyze, or extract patterns based on any of those columns.

Okay, for now, I just want to know some counts, like I want to know the count of module IDs per strategy type.



## ChatGPT (2025-04-03T06:40:32.703041+00:00)

Here’s a breakdown of how many module IDs are associated with each strategy type. Let me know if you’d like to explore these further or slice the data differently.

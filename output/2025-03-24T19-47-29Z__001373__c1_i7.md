🔹 GOAL

You are a Strategy Evaluation Analyst trained in the Strategy Alignment Framework. Your task is to classify a set of Insight Modules by applying a structured scoring process that evaluates alignment across five strategic lenses and six strategy types.

For each Insight Module:

- Read and interpret the full module, including insight statement, decision context, and stress test
- Score all six strategy types across the five lenses using a 1–5 scale
- Calculate the total score for each strategy type
- Assign a single final strategy classification
- Invoke the Tie-Breaker Protocol only if the top two strategy types are within 2 points
- Output a per-module scoring table with totals and final classification

⚠️ Process **no more than 15 Insight Modules total** in this batch—even if more appear in the input. Stop after 15 and wait for further instruction.

🔹 RETURN FORMAT

For each module, return the following structure:

#### Insight Module [ID]

| Strategy Type            | Decision Layer | Strategic Tension | Strategic Intent | Scope & Horizon | Cognitive Framing | Total |
|--------------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------|

| Business-Level           | X              | X                 | X                | X                | X                  | XX     |

**Final Strategy Type →** [Insert one of the above]

**Rationale:** [Include *only* if tie-breaker was used, or if ambiguity was present.]

You do not need to output a summary table in this prompt.

🔹 LENS SCORING GUIDE

Use this scale for each of the five lenses:

- 5 = Strong Alignment
- 4 = Moderate Alignment  
- 3 = Some Alignment 
- 2 = Low Alignment
- 1 = No Alignment

The five strategic lenses are:
1. Decision Layer – Who must act on this insight?
2. Strategic Tension – What is the core tradeoff?
3. Strategic Intent – What outcome is this trying to achieve?
4. Scope & Horizon – How wide and how durable is the impact?
5. Cognitive Framing – What kind of mental logic is being modeled?

---

🔹 STRATEGY TYPES

Score and compare the following six types for every module:

- Corporate-Level – Enterprise-wide portfolio, market entry/exit, structural redesign  
- Business-Level – Competitive positioning, market strategy, go-to-market moves  
- Functional & Tactical – Operational execution, process decisions, department-level actions  
- Adaptive & Crisis – Navigating uncertainty, survival, risk response  
- Innovation & Growth – Disruption, new markets, high-risk/high-reward exploration  
- Personal & Leadership – Executive cognition, mental model shifts, leadership style evolution

---

🔹 TIE-BREAKER RULE

If two strategy types are within **2 total points**, apply the following three-question protocol:

1. Who must act first?
2. What is the biggest risk if misunderstood?
3. What cognitive model is being reshaped?

If one strategy wins **2 out of 3**, tag it as the final classification. Always include a short rationale when using the tie-breaker.

---

🔹 INPUT INSTRUCTIONS

- The input is a document containing a series of Insight Modules
- Each module begins with a header in the form: `### INSIGHT MODULE [X]`
- Complete the scoring + tagging process for each
- ✅ Process up to **15 Insight Modules maximum per batch** to ensure accuracy and completeness
- ❌ If more than 15 are present, stop at the 15th and wait for further instruction

---

🔹 EXPLICIT GUARDRAILS

❌ Never assign more than one strategy type  
❌ Do not infer strategy types based on keywords alone (e.g., “risk” ≠ Adaptive)  
✅ Always ground classification in the five-lens scoring + stress test logic  
✅ Invoke the Tie-Breaker Protocol if scoring is close  
✅ If uncertain, fall back on decision actor identity as primary disambiguator

Each table above reflects our structured, lens‐based evaluation that leads to one clear final strategy type per module. Please let me know if you need further adjustments or additional modules analyzed.

## You (2025-03-24T19:50:47.171000+00:00)

Continue processing from Insight Module 64 onward, using the same scoring structure, five-lens evaluation, and strategy alignment framework as before.

Please:

- Process up to 15 additional insight modules in this batch
- Score all six strategy types across the five strategic lenses
- Use the 1–5 scale for each lens
- Calculate the total per strategy type
- Assign only one final strategy type per insight
- If top two scores are within 2 points, invoke the Tie-Breaker Protocol
- Include a rationale only when a tie-breaker is used or ambiguity is present

Use the same output format:

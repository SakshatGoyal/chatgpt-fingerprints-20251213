Got it — you’re looking for **rings with traditional Indian design language**, but with **finer detailing, articulation, and elegance** — not the oversized or chunky bridal-style ones that dominate most jewelry stores.  

Here’s a few directions to start your search:

### 🛍️ **Trusted Online Indian Jewelry Stores (with refined pieces)**
1. **Tanishq** → [tanishq.co.in](https://www.tanishq.co.in)  
   - Filter for *Heritage* or *Divyam* collections — these often have meenakari, filigree, or jali work in thinner bands.  
   - Check their “Everyday Gold” section for minimal gold rings with traditional motifs.  

2. **Caratlane** → [caratlane.com](https://www.caratlane.com)  
   - Owned by Tanishq; has lighter, more modern-traditional crossover designs.  
   - Search terms: *temple*, *filigree*, *ethnic ring*, *polki ring*.  

3. **Amrapali Jewels** → [amrapalijewels.com](https://www.amrapalijewels.com)  
   - Based in Jaipur. Their **Tribe by Amrapali** line is more affordable and features beautiful handwork — tiny kundan, enamel, and silver gold-plated rings.  

4. **Jaypore** → [jaypore.com](https://www.jaypore.com)  
   - Focuses on handcrafted jewelry — you’ll find oxidized silver, temple-inspired, and filigree rings from small artisans.

Would you like me to narrow it down to **gold** or **silver / oxidized** rings? That’ll help me point you to the right sub-collections and keywords.

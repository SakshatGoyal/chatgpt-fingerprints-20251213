## You (2025-05-26T07:34:54.305927+00:00)

I want to start learning jiu-jitsu. But I know nothing about it. I want to start by solo drills. How do I begin?

That's a great decision—jiu-jitsu can be life-changing for body, mind, and confidence. Starting with solo drills is a smart way to build familiarity with movement, coordination, and body awareness before stepping into a class. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you begin:

---

### **Step 1: Understand What Solo Drills Are**
Solo drills mimic movements and transitions from jiu-jitsu **without a partner**. They build:
- **Mobility** and **flexibility**
- **Core strength**
- **Coordination**
- **Muscle memory** for real grappling situations

---

### **Step 2: Create a Dedicated Practice Space**
You’ll need:
- **8' x 8' of open floor space** (your living room can work)
- A **thick, non-slip mat** (at least 1.5" thick) to absorb shock and protect joints—especially important for knee and shoulder movements. Let me know if you want product recommendations.

---

### **Step 3: Start With These Fundamental Movements**
You can begin with just 15–20 minutes a day. Look up slow tutorial videos on each of these terms on YouTube or BJJ fanatics channels:

| Drill Name           | Why It Matters                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Hip Escape (Shrimping)** | Teaches how to create space and move away from pressure |
| **Bridge (Upa)**         | Builds power to escape from underneath someone |
| **Technical Stand-up**   | Teaches how to stand up safely from the ground |
| **Granby Roll**          | Helps build inversion and fluid transitions |
| **Shoulder Roll (Front/Back)** | Teaches how to fall safely and builds agility |
| **Sit-out Drill**        | Builds mobility and escapes from turtle position |
| **Bear Crawl & Crab Walk** | Strengthens movement under pressure |

Would you like a daily solo drill routine (beginner level) you can follow?

---

### **Step 4: Build a Simple Routine**
For now, keep it simple:
- 2 minutes of each drill
- Total time: ~20 minutes
- Do it 3–5x per week

**Example**:  
- 2 min shrimping  
- 2 min bridging  
- 2 min technical stand-up  
- 2 min bear crawl  
- 2 min crab walk  
*(Repeat if time/energy allows)*

---

### **Step 5: Use a Few Trusted Resources**
Good beginner-friendly YouTube channels:
- “Chewjitsu”  
- “BJJ Fanatics”  
- “Jiu Jitsu Brotherhood”  
- “Stephan Kesting / Grapplearts” (great for structured solo drills)

---

### **Step 6: Track Your Progress**
Start a simple log:
- Which drills you did
- How you felt
- Questions you have

This keeps you motivated and aware of improvement.

---

### Ready for What’s Next?
Once you’re consistent with solo drills and you’re feeling stronger and more coordinated, we can talk about:
- What to expect in your first class
- How to pick a school
- Gear to buy (gi vs no-gi)
- Mindset for learning

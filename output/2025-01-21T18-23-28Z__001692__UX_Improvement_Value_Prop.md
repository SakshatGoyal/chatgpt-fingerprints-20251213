# UX Improvement Value Prop

## You (2025-01-21T18:23:28.384713+00:00)

Imagine you running a digital design agency I'd like you to have a look at all these slides and prepare a sort of value proposition discussion with a stakeholder based on the contents of these slides so what we're doing right now is taking a tool like Luso and essentially trying to improve the user experience of the dashboard canvas area, where an analyst might repair a dashboard. We have a lot of issues where the dashboard itself looks very ugly it's feels very odd in its interaction. It's very unusual and kind of frustrating so we're trying to address all of that through a short like one week one and a half week engagement with the team where we essentially create a sort of design system, and we wanna a a set of points. I've tried to outline those points in these slides. Try using these to create a value proposition discussion with the stakeholder.

Based on the information provided in the slides and your intent to improve the dashboard canvas experience of a tool like Luminoso, here’s a proposed value proposition discussion tailored for stakeholders:

---

**Introduction and Context**

1. **Current State**:
   The existing dashboard canvas is underwhelming in design and interaction quality. It presents an "ugly" and "frustrating" user experience, making it a pain point for analysts who rely on it to prepare dashboards.

2. **Why This Matters**:
   A poor user experience hinders analysts' efficiency, reduces user satisfaction, and ultimately impacts the perceived value of Luminoso. There’s a growing expectation for intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and functional tools.

3. **Opportunity**:
   By addressing these challenges, we can create a scalable, user-friendly design system that not only resolves the immediate frustrations but also sets a strong foundation for future enhancements and scaling efforts.

---

**Key Areas of Focus**

1. **Widget Design System**:
   - Introduce seamless interactions with basic shortcuts (`Cmd+Z`, `Cmd+C`, `Cmd+V`) to enhance productivity.
   - Formalize widget anatomy, ensuring compartmentalized, scalable layouts.
   - Ensure fluidity between text, KPIs, and data visualizations to enhance storytelling.
   - Enable widget duplication to save time when applying repetitive filters.
   - Build hierarchical filters to reduce unnecessary steps and clicks.
   - Improve date slider accuracy for precise time-based analysis.
   - Add advanced customization options like conditional highlighting for better data narrative.

2. **Guidelines for Dashboard Canvas**:
   - Update cursor handles to intuitively convey drag-and-drop functionality.
   - Redesign grid constraints for better tile snapping, responsive layouts, and overall visual consistency.
   - Facilitate dashboard sharing outside the platform for better accessibility and collaboration.

---

**Value Proposition**

1. **For the Analysts**:
   - A dashboard that works the way they expect it to, aligning with Jacob’s Law: *"Users prefer your site to work the same way as the sites they already know."*
   - Reduced frustration, increased efficiency, and a better storytelling capability through intuitive design and interaction.

2. **For Luminoso**:
   - Enhanced user satisfaction and retention by eliminating existing pain points.
   - A polished, scalable design system that positions Luminoso as a forward-thinking, user-focused platform.
   - A competitive edge in the market by aligning with modern UX standards and user expectations.

3. **For Stakeholders**:
   - A cost-effective, focused engagement (1–1.5 weeks) that delivers immediate results with long-term impact.
   - A design system that not only improves the current dashboard but also serves as a framework for future updates and scalability.

---

**Next Steps**

1. Kickstart a rapid, collaborative design sprint with our agency and the Luminoso team to address the outlined challenges.
2. Deliver a refined, tested, and user-validated design system within the engagement period.
3. Equip Luminoso with the tools and guidelines to maintain and expand the system as needs evolve.

This discussion ensures the stakeholders understand the pain points, see the value of the proposed improvements, and recognize the opportunity for long-term benefits through a short, impactful engagement.

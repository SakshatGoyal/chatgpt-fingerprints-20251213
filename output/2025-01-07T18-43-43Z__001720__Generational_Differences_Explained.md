The boundaries of these generations aren’t set in stone, so some people may identify with traits of multiple generations, depending on their personal experiences!

## You (2025-01-07T18:45:38.180855+00:00)

given this chart... could u give me a rough estimate on how many people in our pool might be in gen x, gen y, and gen z

## ChatGPT (2025-01-07T18:45:51.044054+00:00)

To estimate how many people belong to Generation X, Millennials (Gen Y), and Generation Z from the chart, we need to define their graduation year ranges roughly based on their birth years and typical graduation age:

- **Generation X (1965–1980):** Likely graduated high school around 1983–1998.
- **Millennials (Gen Y, 1981–1996):** Likely graduated high school around 1999–2014.
- **Generation Z (1997–2012):** Likely graduated high school around 2015–2030.

Looking at the chart:
1. Identify the graduation year range for each generation.
2. Visually estimate the frequency (height of bars) within those ranges and sum them up.

Would you like me to extract more precise data from the image using tools or just rely on a visual estimation?

## You (2025-01-07T18:46:10.600239+00:00)

give me more precise data



## ChatGPT (2025-01-07T18:46:28.089058+00:00)

The text extraction from the image did not successfully pull numeric data directly from the chart. To provide more precise estimates, I would need to analyze the image visually or digitize the chart to extract values systematically.

I can try digitizing the chart further using specialized methods to extract the frequency data from the bars. Shall I proceed with this approach?

## You (2025-01-07T18:46:40.840861+00:00)

yes



## ChatGPT (2025-01-07T18:48:23.734831+00:00)

The image appears to have transparency (RGBA format) instead of the expected RGB format, which caused the error. I’ll adjust the image to remove the transparency and proceed with extracting the bar heights. Let me fix this issue and continue.



## ChatGPT (2025-01-07T18:48:23.735358+00:00)

The edge detection has successfully outlined the bars in the chart. I will now proceed to extract the bar heights systematically and calculate the estimated frequency for each generation.



## ChatGPT (2025-01-07T18:48:23.735879+00:00)

The bar heights have been successfully extracted as frequency approximations for graduation years. I will now calculate the approximate total frequencies for Generation X, Millennials (Gen Y), and Generation Z based on their defined year ranges.



## ChatGPT (2025-01-07T18:48:23.736408+00:00)

Based on the extracted data from the chart, here are the approximate total frequencies for each generation:

- **Generation X (1983–1998):** ~19,453
- **Millennials (Gen Y, 1999–2014):** ~18,980
- **Generation Z (2015–2025):** ~4,117

These frequencies represent the relative number of individuals from each generation in the given data pool. Let me know if you'd like further analysis!

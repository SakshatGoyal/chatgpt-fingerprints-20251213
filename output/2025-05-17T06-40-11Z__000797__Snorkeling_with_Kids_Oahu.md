Below is a quick-scan table of the *most kid-friendly, shallow-water* snorkeling spots and tours on Oʻahu. Everything listed is either a protected beach-entry lagoon or a boat trip that lets you stand up in the sand before you put your mask in.  

| # | Spot / Tour | Where on Oʻahu | Water depth & conditions | Facilities / Lifeguard | Good for a 7-yr-old? | Notes & tips |
|---|-------------|----------------|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve** | SE coast, 30 min from Waikīkī | Inner reef starts waist-deep; 3–8 m (10–25 ft) average; reef blocks surf citeturn0search6turn0search12 | Bathrooms, gear rental, lifeguards, mandatory intro video | **Excellent** – calm, supervised | Reserve online 2 days ahead; closed Mon & Tue; go early for parking |
| 2 | **Ko Olina Lagoons 1–4** | Leeward (Kapolei) | Man-made coves, lake-like calm all year; sandy bottom ~1–3 m deep citeturn0search2turn0search8 | Showers, bathrooms, lifeguards (lagoons 1–3) | **Excellent** – ideal first-timer “practice pool” | Free public access but parking fills by 9 am |
| 3 | **Kuilima Cove (Turtle Bay)** | North-Shore resort | Sheltered pocket lagoon, mostly 1–2 m, occasional coral heads citeturn0search1turn0search7 | Hotel beach shack, showers; no lifeguard | **Very good** (bring swim shoes) | Watch for shallow coral just under the surface |
| 4 | **Sans Souci / Kaimana Beach** | East Waikīkī | Reef-lined marine reserve; knee-to-chest-deep inside breakwater citeturn1search0turn1search3 | Lifeguard tower, restrooms | **Great** if your nephew is comfortable in light current | Easiest by The Natatorium end; rent gear at the Waikīkī Aquarium |
| 5 | **Magic Island Lagoon (Ala Moana)** | Honolulu harbor side | Man-made seawall forms knee-deep pool; almost no waves citeturn4search0turn4search1 | Restrooms, picnic tables, lifeguard on main beach (not lagoon) | **Great** – plus grassy picnic area | Guided “first-time snorkel” lessons start here (kids 8+) citeturn4search3 |
| 6 | **Paradise Cove Beach** | Next to Ko Olina luau grounds | Sheltered tide-shelf, 0.5–2 m; turtles often feed here citeturn2search0turn2search8 | No lifeguard; limited parking; no bathrooms | **Good** with adult in water | Arrive by 8 am for one of 14 public stalls |
| 7 | **Aweoweo Beach Park** | North Shore (Waialua) | Reef begins steps offshore; stays < 3 m/10 ft deep citeturn3search0turn3search3 | Showers, bathrooms, playground; no lifeguard | **Good** on calm summer days | Quiet local park; bring your own shade |
| 8 | **Shark’s Cove tide pools** | Pupukea, North Shore | Summer only: protected pools 0.5–1.5 m deep; zero waves citeturn0search3turn0search9 | No facilities; food trucks across road | **Good** *June–Sept*; **avoid** winter surf | Wear reef shoes; lava rock entry |
| 9 | **Kāneʻohe Sandbar snorkel charter** (e.g., Captain Bruce) | Kāneʻohe Bay | Boat anchors in thigh-deep water; kids can stand & ease in citeturn0search4turn0search10 | All gear on board; guides in water | **Excellent** if you’re OK with a 20-min boat ride | Reef fish, rays & the odd turtle; morning trips are calmest |

### How to decide (super-quick)

* **Closest to Honolulu:** Magic Island (<10 min) or Sans Souci (20 min).  
* **Richest reef life + full services:** Hanauma Bay.  
* **“Hotel pool” calm:** Ko Olina or Kuilima Cove.  
* **Wanna stand on the sand *and* see fish from a boat?** Kāneʻohe Sandbar charter.  
* **North-Shore summer day-trip:** Aweoweo for turtles, Shark’s Cove tide pools for splash-about.

### Safety & practical notes for a 7-year-old

* Fit a **child-size mask + dry-top snorkel** at a shop first; leaks ruin the fun.  
* Use a **U.S. Coast Guard-approved kid’s life vest** even in lagoons; it keeps their head up while they focus on breathing.  
* **Check daily surf reports** (hioceansafety.com) before any North-Shore or east-side outing; winter swells make shallow spots unsafe.  
* Teach “**look, don’t touch**” – Hawaiian reef fish, turtles and corals are protected by law.  
* Early morning = light wind, best visibility, and easier parking almost everywhere.

With this menu you can match mood, drive-time and your nephew’s comfort level without ever venturing into deep-sea water. Have a fantastic time exploring Oʻahu’s reefs together!

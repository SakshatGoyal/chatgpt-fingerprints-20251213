Daniel’s response would depend on his intent—whether he wants to challenge her, offer quiet dominance, or disengage entirely. Here are different approaches, all in line with his character:

### **1. Controlled and Unbothered (Reinforcing His Presence)**
*"That’s fine. You’ll speak when you’re ready."*
(Steady, assured—makes it clear that he is not chasing but also not going anywhere.)

### **2. Subtly Challenging (Drawing Her Back In)**
*"Then don’t. Just listen."*
(A quiet assertion of control, turning the dynamic in his favor.)

### **3. Icy Disengagement (Testing Her Interest)**
*"Understood. I’ll let you be."*
(A withdrawal of attention—forces her to either accept the space or realize she wants him to stay engaged.)

### **4. Strategic Invitation (Giving Her an Out While Holding Control)**
*"Then don’t talk. Just tell me where you are."*
(Implies he’s willing to be present without pushing for words, but still directs the situation.)

### **5. Direct and Unshaken (Making Her Feel Seen)**
*"I wasn’t asking for conversation. I was making an observation."*
(Assertive, reminding her that his words weren’t meant to be part of small talk, but rather a reflection of her actions.)

### **6. Intimate and Disarming (Eroding Her Guard)**
*"You don’t have to talk. But I can tell when something’s sitting on you. You don’t hide from me as well as you think."*
(A slight unraveling of her defenses, making it clear he sees beyond her words.)

### **7. Cool and Reserved (Letting Her Decide the Next Move)**
*"Alright."*
(Simple, contained. Leaves the weight of silence on her, forcing her to decide if she wants to close the distance.)

Which one fits best depends on how he views her and what he wants from the interaction.

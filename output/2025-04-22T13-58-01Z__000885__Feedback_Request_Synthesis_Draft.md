# Feedback Request Synthesis Draft

## You (2025-04-22T13:58:01.072964+00:00)

Hey, could you help me frame this message in a brief way for my product manager:


Hi everyone, I'm attaching two links here. One of them is the synthesis from all our work so far, and the other one is a design principle link. These are SIGMA links for now, but we can still work on a more Google Doc-like version or Google Sheets-style version of the same document. But I just want to share it quickly so that I can see if there's some early feedback. Based on your feedback last time, I tried to address some of that feedback. One of the feedback was that some of the insights seemed very similar, and it was a little challenging to distinguish between all of them. The same problem still remains to a slight degree in this synthesis. However, what I've tried to do is maintain the similar-looking problem statements together in the same row, so that it's a little easier to quickly surface the distinction between the different problem statements. One thing, and this should probably be at the top of the message, but the contents of this document include... And sorry, just to clarify, the contents of the synthesis document include four archetypes. We had to reduce it from six to four just to manage some of the complexities. We also tried to just slightly tweak and simplify our approach to those industry axes that I mentioned last time. So, the document has four archetypes. I tried to outline a brief description of what those archetypes represent. Along with some of the core strategic tensions they often have to navigate. I've also created a list of roles and functions that align best with those archetypes. For the roles, I tried to make sure it's as closely aligned, but it's still slightly speculative because none of our research papers outline those roles out loud, except in a few situations.
Along with that, there is a version of this where we have the typical themes generated and the insights generated. But after a lot of revisions, it seemed like just outlining the problem statements was a little more digestible. It helped me avoid oversimplifying some of the information from our research. While writing these problem statements, I tried to follow a typical Juni-Zero type format where you'll find the people problems. You'll also find a short source of why you think this is a problem. For each problem statement, there is a separate section called how we might know if we've solved this. This is a slightly speculative territory, but basically what we're trying to communicate with these success measures, despite them being a little qualitative, is that now that we understand the problem, regardless of whatever AI solution that is implemented, whether it's some form of agent or whether it's just a conversational bot or if it's a combination of both, regardless of the solution, here's how we might know if the problem is actually being resolved.

In retrospect, I do feel like only a few of these success measures actually can help us understand, sorry, basically a lot of these, some of these measures are sort of a step-two measure, meaning like, we, it can, it measures a second phase of success, like, okay, now that, okay, so imagine if we introduce a product and it solves a problem and then as a result of that resolution, what happens in step two, some of these success measures are measuring those step two, I try to sort of correct them a little more in our process where the success measures actually show us the progress of the problem being resolved rather than the end outcome, but I think that part might need a little more refinement.

Additionally, as a by-product, since we had a lot of data, we also segmented a small set of insights that helped us understand how AI might shape decision-making for executives and what we tried to do is first we tried to extract some of the principles and then we further refined them. I think more details about that refinement can be found in the design principles document.

With all this work done, I have a few vague ideas about possible next steps to begin prototyping a solution, but it's a little abstract, so I need to spend a little bit of time trying to write it down on paper. Additionally, after this, I'll also try to work on an outline for the overall process.

Okay, so I realized this entire message is sort of jumping all over the place, but I need your help to structure all of this vague, open-ended, almost like a monologue into a structured message that I can send on Slack, GroupChat, which has my product manager and a few other stakeholders. So, yeah, this message is addressing everyone, but yeah, the primary audience is my product manager.

Absolutely — this is a great opportunity to bring clarity and flow to a complex update. The original message has a lot of thoughtful detail, and what we want to do is lift out the key points, anchor around purpose and structure, and offer context in a way that's scannable but still invites the right kind of engagement.

Here’s a reframed version you could use on Slack:

👋 Hey all — sharing two SIGMA links here:

1. **Synthesis of our research + insights**  
2. **Design principles derived from the AI-decision-making work**

This is still a WIP, but I’d love some early feedback — especially before moving to a more polished Google Docs/Sheets version.

### Quick highlights:

- **Archetypes**: We’ve simplified from six to **four core archetypes** to reduce complexity. Each comes with a brief description, strategic tensions they navigate, and aligned roles (some speculative due to limited direct evidence).
- **Problem statements**: Based on our past feedback (e.g. overlapping insights), I’ve grouped similar themes in the same row to help with distinction. These follow a *Juni-Zero-style* structure: people problem → brief "why" → speculative success indicators.
- **Success measures**: Tried to shift focus from second-order outcomes to signals that show **actual progress** toward solving the problem. Some still need refining.
- **Design principles doc**: Captures a separate but related thread — how AI might shape executive decision-making. This started from a segmentation of insights → distilled principles.

I’m also noodling on some prototyping directions, but they’re still early. Will follow up with a rough outline of next steps and process soon.

Would love your thoughts — especially on whether the archetypes + problem framing feel useful and where you'd suggest we sharpen.

Let me know if you want a lighter or more formal tone, but this should land clearly with your PM while keeping the room open for input. Want to tailor it further?

## You (2025-04-22T14:00:10.939747+00:00)

Okay, I like this as a first draft but I think in my earlier message I had a little bit of information on like why I didn't include insights and with regards to success measures, I think the team is not really aware of what the Julie-Zhou process is. They're not aware of the three-question problem approach Like what people problem are we trying to solve? What how we know it's a problem and how might we know if we have solved it like they don't know all that So, yeah, see if you can recapture some of the sort of disclaimers and explanation for what the success measures are.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-22T14:00:11.823610+00:00)

Perfect, thanks — that context helps a lot. It sounds like you want to preserve some of the nuance around *why* the document is structured the way it is, especially around the success measures and the choice to focus on problem statements rather than distilling “insights” or over-simplifying.

Here’s an updated version that keeps the concise flow for Slack, but adds more of your explanatory thinking — especially around success measures and the structure:

---

👋 Hey all — sharing two SIGMA links here:

1. **Research synthesis (WIP)**  
2. **AI-focused design principles**

This is still in an early shape, but I wanted to circulate it for feedback. Based on earlier input — especially around similar-looking insights being hard to distinguish — I made some structural adjustments that I hope make things easier to parse.

### Quick overview:

- **Archetypes**: We've refined the model from 6 to **4 archetypes** to reduce complexity. Each includes a short description, typical strategic tensions, and a mapping to relevant roles (some are speculative, since our sources weren’t always explicit).
  
- **Why not "insights"?**  
  I initially tried organizing the synthesis by themes + insights, but found that *problem statements* did a better job of staying faithful to the nuance of the research without flattening it. So each row in the doc focuses on a distinct **people-problem**, with similar ones grouped together for comparison.

- **Success measures**:  
  For each problem, I included a rough draft of how we might know if it’s been meaningfully addressed. These are qualitative and speculative, and they follow a structure inspired by this prompt:  
  ➤ *What’s the real problem?*  
  ➤ *Why do we believe it’s a problem?*  
  ➤ *How might we know if it’s resolved — regardless of the solution (AI agent, bot, etc.)?*  
  That last piece is tricky. Some measures are more “step two” (i.e. post-solution effects) rather than directly tied to the problem itself — I tried to adjust where I could, but it still needs sharpening.

- **Design principles**:  
  This companion doc captures patterns we noticed around how AI may influence exec decision-making. We started from the data → extracted themes → shaped into early principles.

Lastly, I’ve got some early thoughts on how this could lead to prototype directions, but they’re still vague — I’ll share a rough outline of that soon.

Would especially appreciate reactions on:
- Whether the current framing (archetypes + problem statements) feels actionable  
- Any gaps or muddy spots in the success measures  
- Where you’d want to dig deeper as a next step

Thanks in advance!

This version keeps things structured, digestible, and transparent — and it frames the success measure explanation with a learning mindset rather than assuming prior knowledge. Want me to draft an even shorter Slack intro for the same message?

## You (2025-04-22T14:03:59.200122+00:00)

Okay, so in this, I also need to clarify why I'm using a Figma link rather than a Google Docs. So I think earlier in the message, one thing I may have mentioned is the fact that, you know, in one of our earlier feedbacks, the PM mentioned, or, you know, you don't have to explicitly say that the PM mentioned, but our PM basically mentioned that the insights that she saw, it took a while for her to, like a lot of the insights seemed very similar to each other and it took her a few steps or a few runs to fully understand the differences and all, which is like a valid critique. So, and the fact that that still remains the case to some degree, even in these insights, but to make it easier, what I've done is restructure the document in such a way that all the insights that are similar are almost grouped so that it's a lot easier now to clearly identify the distinctions between all of them. And like there's some meaning behind the way the entire document is structured, you know, like, yes, some of the problem statements across different archetypes might seem similar, but it's basically a representation of how the same problem might sometimes sort of surface in different ways for different archetypes in different contexts. So, yeah, there's some reason behind the way the document is structured. And I was wondering if we should actually highlight it or if we should just keep it more latent.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-22T14:04:00.063906+00:00)

Great, that gives me a much fuller picture of the intent — both in terms of the document's *form* (why it’s in Figma) and *structure* (why the groupings and layout matter). You're balancing feedback about clarity with a desire not to over-simplify the nuance of overlapping problems — that’s really thoughtful work.

Here's a revised version of the message that:
- Acknowledges the choice of **Figma** over Docs (and why)
- Highlights the **structural thinking** behind the layout (without being too heavy-handed)
- Keeps the tone collaborative and open to feedback

👋 Hey all — sharing two SIGMA links here:

1. **Research synthesis (WIP)**  
2. **AI-focused design principles**

Still early, but wanted to get this in front of you all for feedback. Based on earlier input, especially around how some of the insights felt similar or hard to distinguish, I’ve made a few structural choices that I hope make the document easier to navigate and understand.

### Quick context:

- **Why Figma?**  
  I’ve used Figma here (instead of Google Docs/Sheets) because the **spatial layout** helps visually group similar problem statements — making it easier to see distinctions and patterns at a glance. The feedback that some insights felt very close to one another is still valid, but hopefully the way they’re now grouped side-by-side brings more clarity.

- **Archetypes**: We've consolidated from 6 to **4 archetypes** for simplicity. Each has a short description, the key strategic tensions it faces, and a mapping to typical roles (some speculative based on available data).

- **Why problem statements, not “insights”?**  
  I moved away from listing general insights because I found that **problem framing** was more faithful to the nuance in the research — and avoided flattening meaning. Each row focuses on a people-problem, grouped near similar ones to make comparisons easier.

- **Success measures**:  
  For each problem, there’s a draft of how we *might* know if we’ve meaningfully addressed it — regardless of the specific solution (agent, bot, hybrid).  
  These are qualitative and speculative, and they follow this framing:  
  ➤ *What’s the real people-problem?*  
  ➤ *Why do we believe it’s a problem?*  
  ➤ *How might we know it’s being resolved — not just end-state, but progress?*  
  Some measures still lean a bit too far into "step two" outcomes (i.e. what happens *after* a problem is solved). I’ve tried to correct that, but more refinement is probably needed.

- **Design principles**:  
  This doc reflects a separate stream — how AI might shape exec decision-making. We started with a wide set of data points → extracted patterns → refined into early principles.

Finally, the way the synthesis doc is laid out *is intentional* — even when similar problems appear under different archetypes. That reflects how similar challenges show up differently depending on context. I’ve debated whether to call that out explicitly or just let the structure speak for itself — open to thoughts there.

Would love your feedback on:
- Whether the structure/layout helps with clarity  
- If the archetypes and problem framings feel grounded  
- How we might sharpen the success measures  
- Any reactions that might guide next steps

Thanks!

This should land well in Slack — clear, thoughtful, not overwhelming, and shows your responsiveness to prior feedback while guiding the reader through how to engage. Want a compressed one-liner version at the top too, like “Dropping a first pass for feedback on our synthesis work — would love your eyes”?

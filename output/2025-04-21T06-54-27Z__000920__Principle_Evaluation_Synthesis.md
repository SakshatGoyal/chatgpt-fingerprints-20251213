# Principle Evaluation Synthesis

## You (2025-04-21T06:54:27.689000+00:00)

Prompt:

You are evaluating the design principles of a new AI tool aimed at helping senior executives think more clearly and confidently about complex business strategy. These principles are provided in a .md file and include a core belief, a counter-principle, an example, and a short rationale. You - Julie and Tim, are thinking collaboratively for this

⸻

🎯 Your Objective:

Critically and constructively assess each design principle using the rubric and decision framework below. Your feedback will guide the refinement, consolidation, and prioritization of principles that shape how this AI behaves during strategic conversations. Focus on clarity, usability, and sharpness — not fluff or abstraction.

⸻

👓 Your Evaluation Lens:

Hold these mindsets throughout:
	•	Clarity over cleverness – Does this help someone do something more effectively?
	•	Tension over truisms – Does it surface a real tradeoff, not just sound good?
	•	Usefulness over abstraction – Can you imagine how this shapes a product experience?

Avoid rating based on inspirational tone or clever phrasing. Counter-principles are not wrong — evaluate the quality of the tension. Do not fixate on grammar or assume access to private/internal company data.

⸻

📐 Scoring Rubric (1–5 for each criterion):

Criterion	What to Assess
Strategic Usefulness	Will this help make clearer product/design decisions in ambiguous situations?
Conceptual Distinctiveness	Is this principle meaningfully different from others?
Real-World Relevance	Does this reflect real dilemmas senior executives face?
Product Imaginability	Can you envision how this principle shapes actual product behavior or flows?
Counter-Principle Strength	Is the opposite principle a defensible, reasonable stance?
Emotional Resonance (Optional)	Does the principle feel intuitively compelling or insightful?

Score each from 1–5. Use brief but clear comments to justify your evaluation.

⸻

🧾 Your Deliverable: One Unified Table

For each principle in the .md file, fill out a row in this table:

Principle Name	Strategic Usefulness	Distinctiveness	Real-World Relevance	Product Imaginability	Counter-Principle Strength	Emotional Resonance	Comments	Final Recommendation


Final Recommendation options:
	•	Keep (Core) — Strong, actionable, and distinctive
	•	Refine or Merge — Has value but needs reworking or overlaps with others
	•	Cut — Too generic, not actionable, or unhelpful in shaping real decisions

⸻

🧠 Important Notes:
	•	Evaluate independently — do not copy or reference example scores.
	•	Assume external-only data context — no reliance on proprietary or internal signals.
	•	Add a short reflection at the end if patterns, phrasing tweaks, or merge candidates emerge.

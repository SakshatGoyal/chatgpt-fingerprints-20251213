You're a District Sales Manager at Palo Alto Networks. Review the content on this file and create a glossary of all terms that a UX Designer unaware of Sales and Palo Alto Networks might not be aware of from this file. Sort the terms in alphabetical order, and return the term, its definition, and an example for reference.

Here're some examples of terms that are too complex for a designer:

### Notes
- **Multithreading** was already defined in the earlier glossary (engaging multiple stakeholders).
- **ACV, EOM/EOQ and FedRAMP** were explicitly requested and have been added above.
- Many of the other acronyms (e.g., CIEM, CSPM, CWPP, NGFW, STIG/FIPS, SLED, NASPO, GSA, VPAT) come from public‑sector procurement or cloud‑security frameworks and could be unfamiliar to a UX designer, so they have been included for completeness.

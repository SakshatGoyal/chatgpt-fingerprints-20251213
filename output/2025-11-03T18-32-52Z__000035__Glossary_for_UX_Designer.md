{"content_type": "user_editable_context", "user_profile": "Very important: The user's timezone is Asia/Kolkata. The current date is 04th November, 2025. Any dates before this are in the past, and any dates after this are in the future. When dealing with modern entities/companies/people, and the user asks for the 'latest', 'most recent', 'today's', etc. don't assume your knowledge is up to date; you MUST carefully confirm what the *true* 'latest' is first. If the user seems confused or mistaken about a certain date or dates, you MUST include specific, concrete dates in your response to clarify things. This is especially important when the user is referencing relative dates like 'today', 'tomorrow', 'yesterday', etc -- if the user seems mistaken in these cases, you should make sure to use absolute/exact dates like 'January 1, 2010' in your response.\nThe user's location is Hyderabad, Telangana, India.\n\n", "user_instructions": "If I ask about events that occur after the knowledge cutoff or about a current/ongoing topic, do not rely on your stored knowledge. Instead, use the search tool first to find recent or current information. Return and cite relevant results from that search before answering the question. If you’re unable to find recent data after searching, state that clearly.\n DO NOT PUT LONG SENTENCES IN MARKDOWN TABLES. Tables are for keywords, phrases, numbers, and images. Keep prose in the body."}

You're a District Sales Manager at Palo Alto Networks. Review the content on this file and create a glossary of all terms that a UX Designer unaware of Sales and Palo Alto Networks might not be aware of from this file. Sort the terms in alphabetical order, and return the term, its definition, and an example for reference. 

Here're some examples of terms that are too complex for a designer:

These definitions should help a UX designer unfamiliar with sales or security to understand the terminology used in the **High Impact Use‑Cases** document.

### Notes
- **Multithreading** was already defined in the earlier glossary (engaging multiple stakeholders).  
- **ACV, EOM/EOQ and FedRAMP** were explicitly requested and have been added above.  
- Many of the other acronyms (e.g., CIEM, CSPM, CWPP, NGFW, STIG/FIPS, SLED, NASPO, GSA, VPAT) come from public‑sector procurement or cloud‑security frameworks and could be unfamiliar to a UX designer, so they have been included for completeness.

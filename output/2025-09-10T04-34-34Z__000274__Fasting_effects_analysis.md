# Fasting effects analysis

## You (2025-09-10T04:34:34.877780+00:00)

# Role and Objective
- Synthesize and interpret the latest and historical medical research on the physiological effects of a 10-day fast specifically for a 33-year-old man weighing 220 pounds who engages in light morning exercise (walking, jogging, knee pushups, and squats).

# Checklist
- Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of what you will do; keep items conceptual, not implementation-level.

# Instructions
- Thoroughly review current and past studies regarding extended fasting in adults, with attention to age, gender, and body weight when available.
- Generate a detailed, day-by-day physiological timeline (Days 1–10) in a narrative, reader-friendly format. For each day, include:
  - Estimated fat loss (in lbs or kg)
  - Estimated muscle loss (in lbs or kg)
  - Key positive or adaptive effects (e.g., autophagy onset, fat mobilization, metabolic improvements)
  - Potential negative effects or speculative drawbacks
  - Expected timing and progression of core processes (e.g., autophagy, fat burning)
  - Risks tied to over-exercising while fasting
  - Safe exercise recommendations for the fasting period
  - Day-specific changes in major body systems (brain, lungs, liver, digestive system, etc.)
  - Quality of evidence for each effect (empirical, inferred, speculative)
- Clearly label all findings by evidence category (empirical, inferred, or speculative).
- Indicate uncertainty and note where research for this user’s profile is lacking.
- When estimating, tailor as much as possible to the described user (33-year-old, 220-pound man, light exercise).

# Context
- User profile: 33-year-old male, 220 lb, light daily exercise.
- Out of scope: Diagnosing/medical advice; focus is on scientific evidence and plausible physiological changes.

# Reasoning Steps
- Perform a stepwise internal review, comparing study populations and protocols to user characteristics.
- Adjust and annotate estimates for differences in age, weight, and activity level as needed.

# Planning and Verification
- After producing each day’s summary, validate that each physiological effect or estimate is referenced to the best available evidence or clearly flagged as inferred/speculative. If validation fails, correct the summary.
- Note any evidence limitations or extrapolations clearly in the "notes" section.

# Output Format
- Output: Reader-friendly written report, with a clear section for each day (Days 1–10). Each day's section should present the information in narrative form, incorporating:
  - Fat and muscle loss estimates with evidence indications (empirical, inferred, speculative).
  - Description of key positive and negative effects, including timing/progression of autophagy and fat burning.
  - Risks and recommendations for exercise.
  - Main system changes (brain, liver, etc.) with brief evidence labels.
  - Noted uncertainty, study limitations, and where data are extrapolated or missing.
- Maintain clear organization and structure, using headings or bullet points where appropriate for readability.

# Verbosity
- Use concise technical descriptions where appropriate.
- Apply brief evidence notes and clarifications.

# Stop Conditions
- Complete the report for all 10 days, ensuring each required topic is included per day.
- Highlight evidence quality and uncertainty; flag any major gaps.
- Return only when all output criteria are satisfied.

**Concise plan (what I’ll do)**
- Synthesize the best human data (classic + recent) on 5–10‑day total fasts and map them to your profile (33‑yo, 220 lb, light AM exercise).
- Build a day‑by‑day (Days 1–10) physiological timeline (fat vs. muscle loss, metabolic shifts, organ‑system changes) with **evidence tags**: *Empirical, Inferred, Speculative*.
- Quantify daily **fat and muscle (lean tissue–equivalent)** loss with uncertainty ranges, adjusted to a 220‑lb male doing light activity.
- Flag **risks**, especially from over‑exercising and refeeding (electrolytes), and give **safe exercise guardrails** for each phase.
- Call out **where evidence is strong vs. limited**, and what’s extrapolated from unlike populations or protocols.

## How I calibrated the estimates (brief)
- **Best human anchors** for multi‑day *water‑only* fasting include: a 7‑day trial showing ~**1.4 kg fat** and **~2.6 kg lean** loss (by N‑balance) with **VO₂peak ↓13%** but **strength preserved**; daily urinary nitrogen fell from ~15→~10 g/d across the week (young adults, supervised) . Classic starvation physiology defines the **fuel shift**: glycogen → gluconeogenesis → **ketone‑dominant** (>2–3 d), with **brain ketone use** rising over days to weeks (ultimately up to ~60–70% in prolonged starvation) . Early fasting often causes **natriuresis/diuresis** (Na⁺ loss peaking ~day 4), then conservation, which shapes water/“lean mass” changes on DXA (fluid) more than true contractile protein loss .
- **Autophagy** timing in humans is uncertain: animal data shows 24–48 h up‑regulation; human signals exist but are mixed (PBMC flux sometimes unchanged acutely; iTRE over months may increase flux). I therefore mark autophagy timing as *inferred/speculative* day‑by‑day .
- Where 10‑day human water‑only data are scarce, I extrapolate from 7‑day results + classic starvation reviews, marking clearly *Inferred*.

> **Important definition for “muscle loss”:** I report **protein oxidation from urinary nitrogen** (Empirical/Inferred) and also convert that to **“lean tissue–equivalent”** using the conventional 1 g N ≈ 6.25 g protein and **muscle tissue ≈ 20% protein**, i.e., lean tissue ≈ 5×protein. This **overestimates true myofibrillar loss** because much “lean mass” on DXA includes water/glycogen/connective tissue, and **strength can be preserved** at 6–7 days. I flag this wherever used.

## Day‑by‑day timeline (Days 1–10)
Assumptions for scaling: 220 lb (100 kg) male, light AM movement (walking/jogging, knee push‑ups, squats). Early RMR typically **unchanged or slightly up** (catecholamines) through ~3–5 days; fat contribution to energy **rises sharply**; by ~day 5, resting RER ~0.75–0.78 (fat‑dominant). **Ranges** below reflect heavier body mass than typical study volunteers and light daily activity.

### **Day 1**
- **Estimated losses** *(Inferred)*
  - **Fat:** ~0.10–0.20 kg (0.2–0.4 lb). Glycogen still fuels much activity.
  - **Muscle (lean‑equiv, upper‑bound):** N ≈ 16–20 g → protein 100–125 g → **lean‑equiv 0.50–0.63 kg (1.1–1.4 lb)**. True contractile loss likely much less.
- **What’s happening**
  - **Fuel:** Liver glycogen depletion begins; gluconeogenesis ramps; lipolysis/FFA rise. *(Empirical)*
  - **Hormones:** Insulin falls; catecholamines may rise; GH pulses rise; T3 begins to dip slightly; rT3 edges up. *(Empirical)*
  - **Organs:**
    - **Brain:** still glucose‑dominant; small ketone uptake. *(Empirical)*
    - **Kidney:** **Natriuresis/diuresis** starts (Na⁺ loss). *(Empirical)*
    - **Liver:** glycogen rundown; gluconeogenesis from lactate/glycerol/AA. *(Empirical)*
- **Exercise risks & guidance** *(Inferred)*: Light walk/jog fine; avoid sudden sprints/heavy sets due to early **glycogen↘** and evolving orthostatic symptoms; hydrate to offset diuresis. *(Empirical for natriuresis; guidance inferred)*

  - **Uric acid:** tends to **rise** with ketonemia as excretion competes; gout‑prone individuals at flare risk. *(Empirical)*
- **Exercise:** Keep **Zone 1** only; add longer warm‑ups; avoid hot environments. *(Inferred)*
- **Autophagy:** likely higher vs. baseline (animals); human confirmation mixed → **Inferred/Speculative**.

- **Organs:**
  - **Brain:** ketones increasingly used; cognition generally preserved. *(Empirical)*
  - **Thyroid:** **T3↓**, **rT3↑** (adaptive energy conservation). *(Empirical)*
  - **GI:** motility slows; bile stasis risk rises with prolonged fasting (longer‑term risk for gallbladder sludge/stones). *(Empirical)*
- **Exercise:** Keep sessions short (≤30–40 min easy), prioritize **walking** + gentle mobility; stop if **presyncopal**. *(Inferred aligned to OH risk)*
- **Autophagy:** **Inferred** to be active; human tissue‑level evidence still inconsistent. *(Inferred/Speculative)*

### **Day 4**
- **Fat:** ~0.20–0.32 kg (0.4–0.7 lb). *(Inferred)*
- **Muscle (lean‑equiv upper‑bound):** N ≈ 12–15 g → protein 75–94 g → **lean‑equiv 0.38–0.47 kg**. *(Inferred)*
- **Fuel & performance:** RMR still near baseline; **fat provides ~70–75%+ of resting energy**; **VO₂peak begins to drift down** (measurable by day 6). *(Empirical)*
- **Organs:**
  - **Kidney:** **Na⁺ loss peaks ~day 4** then wanes; maintain hydration to reduce OH. *(Empirical)*
  - **Liver:** robust ketogenesis; gluconeogenesis increasingly from **glycerol** vs. AA. *(Empirical)*

### **Day 5**
- **Fat:** ~0.20–0.32 kg (0.4–0.7 lb). *(Inferred)*
- **Muscle (lean‑equiv upper‑bound):** N ≈ 11–13 g → protein 69–81 g → **lean‑equiv 0.34–0.41 kg**. *(Inferred)*

  - **Brain:** ketone fraction rising; glucose needs reduced. *(Empirical)*
  - **Uric acid:** still elevated with ketosis; generally reversible on refeed. *(Empirical)*
- **Exercise:** **Keep to gentle movement** (walking, light mobility). Resist strength to very easy technique sets only. *(Inferred)*
- **Autophagy:** still **Inferred/Speculative** (no consensus human day‑by‑day markers).

### **Day 6**
- **Fat:** ~0.20–0.30 kg (0.4–0.7 lb). *(Inferred)*
- **Muscle (lean‑equiv upper‑bound):** N ≈ 10.5–12.5 g → protein 66–78 g → **lean‑equiv 0.33–0.39 kg**. *(Inferred)*
- **Performance:** **VO₂peak ~7–13% lower**; **strength preserved** (knee extensors) despite “lean mass” drop—supporting that much DXA lean loss is water/connective tissue, not contractile protein. *(Empirical)*
- **Organs:**
  - **Respiratory:** lower **RER** → relatively less CO₂ produced at rest. *(Empirical)*
- **Exercise:** Walk only, preferably **flat**, nasal breathing. Stop for dizziness; avoid heat. *(Inferred)*

### **Day 7**
- **Fat:** ~0.20–0.30 kg (0.4–0.7 lb). *(Inferred)*
- **Muscle (lean‑equiv upper‑bound):** N ≈ 10–12 g → protein 63–75 g → **lean‑equiv 0.31–0.38 kg**. *(Empirical trajectory to day 7)*
- **Net 7‑day reference point (for scale):** **Fat −1.4 kg**, **lean −~2.6 kg (from N)** in supervised adults; **body mass −~5.8 kg**; **no serious AEs** reported. *(Empirical)*
- **Exercise:** Maintain **easy walking** 20–40 min; brief posture drills to mitigate OH. *(Inferred)*

- **Muscle (lean‑equiv upper‑bound):** N ≈ 9–11 g → protein 56–69 g → **lean‑equiv 0.28–0.35 kg**. *(Extrapolated)*
- **Organs:**
  - **Kidney/acid‑base:** physiological ketosis → renal ammoniagenesis buffers acid load; continued **uric acid retention** with ketones. *(Empirical)*
- **Exercise:** **Keep it restorative** (walk/mobility). No tempo or strength progression. *(Inferred)*

### **Day 9**
- **Fat:** ~0.18–0.26 kg (0.4–0.6 lb). *(Inferred)*
- **Muscle (lean‑equiv upper‑bound):** N ≈ 8.5–10.5 g → protein 53–66 g → **lean‑equiv 0.27–0.33 kg**. *(Extrapolated)*
- **Brain:** substantial ketone use; glucose demand reduced; cognitive performance in healthy fasters generally preserved in lab settings. *(Empirical/general)*

- **Muscle (lean‑equiv upper‑bound):** N ≈ 8–10 g → protein 50–63 g → **lean‑equiv 0.25–0.31 kg**. *(Extrapolated)*
- **Whole‑body status:** Deepened fat reliance; **carbohydrate oxidation suppressed** during exercise (PDH inhibition via **PDK4↑**), which caps high‑intensity capacity. *(Empirical)*
- **Refeed tomorrow (risk context):** **Refeeding syndrome** risk peaks in first 3–5 days of re‑feeding—**phosphate, potassium, magnesium, thiamine** shifts can precipitate arrhythmias/edema. *(Empirical)*
- **Exercise:** Day‑10 movement only for circulation; **avoid** vigorous work; prepare for **slow, staged refeed** (clinical protocols start at ~20–25% of needs and up‑titrate over 3–5 days with electrolyte monitoring). *(Empirical for guidelines; generic advice, not personal medical care)*

---

## Phase‑level positives & drawbacks (with evidence quality)

**Positives / adaptive**
- **Fat mobilization & metabolic switching** within 2–3 days; resting **fat oxidation ~70%+** by day 5. *(Empirical)*
- **Brain ketone utilization** rises across days, sparing glucose. *(Empirical)*
- **Strength preserved** over ~6–7 days despite DXA lean loss; **VO₂peak ↓ ~13%** (aerobic ceiling). *(Empirical)*
- **Cardiometabolic markers** (BP, TG, LDL‑C, glucose) often improve in **medically supervised modified fasts** (200–300 kcal/d), with good tolerability in large cohorts. *(Empirical, not pure water‑only)*

**Drawbacks / risks**
- **Orthostatic hypotension** from early natriuresis/diuresis → dizziness, syncope risk. *(Empirical)*
- **Uric acid rises** with ketonemia (gout risk). *(Empirical)*
- **Electrolyte vulnerability** on **refeeding** (hypophosphatemia, hypoK, hypoMg) → **arrhythmias**; case reports of severe events in unsupervised prolonged fasts. *(Empirical)*
- **Gallbladder stasis/sludge** risk with prolonged fasting. *(Empirical)*
- **Autophagy claims**: timing and magnitude **uncertain in humans** (mixed PBMC flux findings); treat narratives as **Inferred/Speculative**. *(Empirical that evidence is mixed)*

---

## Safe exercise recommendations across the 10 days (tailored to light AM routine)
- **Intensity ceiling:** keep to **very easy (Zone 1)** throughout; **no HIIT, no max lifts**; shorten or split sessions if light‑headed. *(Inferred from VO₂peak drop & OH risk)*
- **Modality:** prioritize **flat walking**, gentle joint mobility, diaphragmatic/nasal breathing; postpone jogging if HR drifts high or symptoms appear. *(Inferred)*
- **Environment:** avoid heat; stand up slowly; consider seated breaks to mitigate orthostasis. *(Empirical for OH management)*
- **Stop rules (seek care if needed):** persistent dizziness, palpitations, syncope, severe cramps/weakness, dark urine (rhabdomyolysis concern), or chest pain. *(Empirical general risk framing)*
- **Refeeding days:** treat first **3–5 days post‑fast** as the highest‑risk period for electrolyte shifts; **no hard training** until feeding stabilized and symptoms absent. *(Empirical)*

---

## Quick numeric summary (10 days; tailored ranges)
- **Total fat loss:** ~**1.8–2.9 kg (4–6.5 lb)** (higher end if baseline energy expenditure is high and light activity maintained). *(Inferred; anchored to ~0.2–0.3 kg/d mid‑fast)*
- **Total “muscle/lean” loss (upper‑bound lean‑equiv):** **~3.6–4.7 kg (8–10 lb)** by N‑balance conversion. True **contractile muscle** loss is likely **smaller** given preserved strength at 7 d; much of the DXA “lean” loss is water/glycogen/connective tissue shifts. *(Empirical to 7 d; extrapolated to 10 d)*

---

## Evidence notes, limitations, and uncertainty
- **Direct 10‑day, water‑only** trials in healthy adults are uncommon; the strongest modern **water‑only** dataset is **7 days** with detailed nitrogen, body‑comp and performance. I **extrapolated** from day 7 to days 8–10 and labeled those entries **Inferred**.
- Many large cohorts (4–21 d) are **modified fasts** (≈200–300 kcal/d) with supportive care; these demonstrate safety and cardiometabolic benefits but are **not identical** to water‑only protocols.
- **Autophagy**: robust in animals after 24–48 h; human **flux** data are **heterogeneous** (some show increases with long‑term iTRE; some show no acute change in PBMCs). Thus timing per day is **Inferred/Speculative**.
- **“Muscle loss”** reported as **lean tissue–equivalent** from N‑balance **overestimates** true loss of contractile proteins; real functional loss appears smaller (strength preserved at day 6–7).

---

## Key primary sources behind this synthesis
- **7‑day water‑only trial (2025):** body‑comp via DXA, daily N‑excretion, RMR/RER, VO₂peak, muscle strength; **fat −1.4 kg**, **lean −~2.6 kg (by N)**; **VO₂peak −13%**, **RMR unchanged**, **resting fat oxidation ↑ to ~73%** by day 5.
- **Classic starvation physiology:** **fuel transition**, brain ketone use, glucose production in prolonged fasting.
- **Early RMR and catecholamines:** short‑term fasting can show **RMR ↑** with **norepinephrine ↑**; mixed data later.
- **Natriuresis/diuresis time‑course:** Na⁺ excretion **rises by day 2**, **peaks ~day 4**, then falls.
- **Uric acid rises with ketonemia** during prolonged fasting.
- **Gallbladder stasis** and fasting.
- **Refeeding syndrome** consensus/guidance (electrolytes & thiamine).

---

### Bottom line for a 33‑yo, 220‑lb male doing light daily exercise
Across 10 days without food, expect a **rapid metabolic switch to fat**, **rising ketone use by the brain**, **some water‑driven “lean” loss** with **modest true contractile protein loss** (strength largely intact at ~1 week), a **drop in aerobic ceiling**, and **phase‑specific risks** (early orthostatic symptoms, uric acid rise; **highest risk during refeeding**). Keep activity **easy and brief**, avoid heat and high‑intensity work, and treat refeeding as a **clinical‑grade process** due to electrolyte shifts. *(Evidence tags embedded above; key citations provided.)*

If you want, I can export the day‑by‑day section as a printable one‑pager with your **daily exercise script** alongside the physiological notes (same evidence tags).

## You (2025-09-10T12:02:14.285000+00:00)

repeat all the content from the previous response and rewrite it for someone with no knowledge of medical terms.





## ChatGPT (2025-09-10T12:02:15.187623+00:00)

Below is the **same content as before**, rewritten in **plain, non-medical language** while keeping all numbers, phases, and caveats. I’m also keeping the **evidence labels** but simplifying how they’re described:

- **Strong research** = studies directly show this in people.
- **Best estimate** = based on good science but scaled/extrapolated to your situation.
- **Speculative** = plausible, but human proof is limited or mixed.

---

# Quick plan (what I’ll do)
- Pull together the best human research on 5–10-day fasts and match it to **you** (33, 220 lb, light morning exercise).
- Give a **day-by-day guide (Days 1–10)**: fat loss, possible muscle/“lean” changes, what’s happening in your body, good and bad effects, and **safe exercise**.
- Tag each point with **Strong research / Best estimate / Speculative** so you know how solid it is.
- Point out **risks** (especially from over-doing exercise and from **refeeding**).
- Call out **unknowns** and where I’m estimating.

---

## How I chose the numbers (simple version)
- Modern 7-day, water-only data in healthy adults show: **~1.4 kg (3.1 lb) fat lost**, **~2.6 kg (5.7 lb) “lean” lost** (mostly water/glycogen + some protein), **resting calorie burn ~unchanged**, **fat burning way up by day 5**, **VO₂max (top aerobic capacity) down ~13%**, **strength about the same** at a week. **Strong research**
- Classic science on going without food shows the fuel switch: **glycogen → making new glucose → ketones (fat by-products)**. The **brain** uses more ketones over several days, easing the pull on blood sugar. **Strong research**
- Early in a fast, your body **dumps extra water and salt** (you pee more). That makes the scale and “lean mass” drop look bigger than actual muscle loss. **Strong research**
- **Autophagy** (“cell cleanup”) is well-shown in animals after 24–48 h, but exact timing and size of the effect **in humans** day-by-day is **uncertain**. I mark it **Speculative/Best estimate** day-to-day.
- Where 10-day human water-only data are thin, I **extend** the 7-day patterns to days 8–10 and label those **Best estimate**.

> **Important note about “muscle loss”:** I give an **upper-bound “lean-tissue equivalent”** based on protein breakdown math. This **overestimates true muscle fiber loss** because a lot of the “lean drop” is **water, glycogen, and connective tissue**, not actual contractile muscle. The fact that **strength stayed intact at ~1 week** supports this.

- **Fat:** ~0.18–0.28 kg (0.4–0.6 lb). **Best estimate**
- **Lean-equiv (upper-bound):** ~0.28–0.35 kg. **Best estimate**
- **Body systems:**
  - **Kidneys/acid-base:** your body adjusts to the **acid load** from ketosis; **uric acid** can still run high during the fast. **Strong research**
- **Exercise:** Keep it **restorative** (walk, mobility). **Best estimate**

### Day 9
- **Fat:** ~0.18–0.26 kg (0.4–0.6 lb). **Best estimate**
- **Lean-equiv (upper-bound):** ~0.27–0.33 kg. **Best estimate**
- **Body systems:**
  - **Brain:** now runs **substantially on ketones**; most healthy people function fine for easy tasks. **Strong research**
- **Exercise:** Same gentle plan.

### Day 10
- **Fat:** ~0.18–0.25 kg (0.4–0.55 lb). **Best estimate**
- **Lean-equiv (upper-bound):** ~0.25–0.31 kg. **Best estimate**
- **Whole-body status:** Deep **fat-reliance**; your body temporarily **down-regulates carb-burning gears**—so sprints and hard lifts feel **especially tough**. **Strong research**
- **Refeeding alert (starting tomorrow):** The **first 3–5 days of eating again** are the **highest-risk** time for **electrolyte shifts** (phosphate, potassium, magnesium) and **thiamine** needs. Done wrong, this can affect the heart and cause swelling. **Strong research**
- **Exercise:** Keep it **very easy today**; plan a **slow, step-by-step refeed** (medical-style plans start low and increase over several days with electrolytes watched). **Strong research (general guidance); not personal medical advice**

## Big-picture upsides and drawbacks

**Upsides (adaptations)**
- Fast **switch to fat** as the main fuel; by around day 5, **~70%+** of resting energy is from fat. **Strong research**
- **Brain** can use a lot of **ketones**, easing the need for sugar. **Strong research**
- **Strength stays intact** at ~1 week; **aerobic top-end** drops. **Strong research**
- In **modified fasts** (tiny calories allowed) under supervision, blood pressure, triglycerides, and blood sugar often **improve**. **Strong research** (note: not identical to water-only)

**Drawbacks / risks**
- **Dizzy on standing** from water/salt loss early on. **Strong research**
- **Uric acid** rises with ketosis (gout risk if prone). **Strong research**
- **Refeeding syndrome** risk if you eat too much too fast after—dangerous **electrolyte** shifts and **thiamine** needs. **Strong research**
- **Gallbladder** flow slows with longer fasting → sludge/stones risk over time. **Strong research**
- **Autophagy** stories are popular, but **human timing and size are unclear** day-to-day. **Speculative**

## Safe exercise rules for all 10 days (fits your light AM routine)
- **Keep it easy** (comfortable pace). **No HIIT, no max lifting.** If your heart rate drifts up unusually or you feel off, **back off**. **Best estimate backed by Strong research on capacity drop**
- **What to do:** **Flat walking**, gentle mobility, nasal/diaphragm breathing. **Best estimate**
- **Safety tips:** Avoid heat, stand up slowly, sit if dizzy. **Strong research for low blood pressure on standing**
- **Stop and get help** if: repeated dizziness/fainting, racing heartbeat, chest pain, severe cramps/weakness, **cola-colored urine** (muscle breakdown worry). **Strong research (general safety)**
- **After the fast:** **First 3–5 refeed days** are riskiest—**no hard training** until eating and symptoms are stable. **Strong research**

---

## Quick numbers for the full 10 days (scaled to 220 lb with light activity)
- **Total fat lost:** about **1.8–2.9 kg (4–6.5 lb)**. **Best estimate**
- **Total “lean-equivalent” lost (upper-bound):** about **3.6–4.7 kg (8–10 lb)**. Real **muscle fiber loss is likely much less** (strength stays intact at ~1 week). **Strong research to day 7; Best estimate to day 10**

---

## What we know vs. don’t know (limitations)
- Great modern **7-day, water-only** data exist; **10-day** is rarer, so days 8–10 are **Best estimates** based on day-7 patterns.
- Many big studies (4–21 days) use **tiny-calorie “modified” fasts** with medical support; they show **safety and health marker gains** but aren’t identical to water-only.
- **Autophagy:** animal data is clear; **human** day-by-day timing and size of the effect are **uncertain**.
- Reported “lean loss” **overstates real muscle loss** because it includes **water/glycogen/connective tissue**. The **no-strength-loss at ~1 week** is the practical clue.

---

## Bottom line (for a 33-year-old, 220-lb man with light daily exercise)
Across 10 days without food, expect a **fast move to fat burning**, **brain using more ketones**, a **big water/“lean” drop early** with **modest true muscle loss**, **aerobic top-end down**, and **phase-specific risks** (early dizziness from water/salt loss, higher uric acid; the **biggest risk is when you start eating again**). Keep movement **easy and short**, avoid heat and hard efforts, and handle **refeeding slowly and carefully**.

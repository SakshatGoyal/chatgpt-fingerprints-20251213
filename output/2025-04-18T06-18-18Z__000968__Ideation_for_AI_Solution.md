# Ideation for AI Solution

## You (2025-04-18T06:18:18.488000+00:00)

So, give me a few ideas on how we could begin ideating on potential solutions for our project.

Here are a few strategic ways to start ideating on potential solutions for your AI-based thought partner for executives:

---

### 🧭 1. **Frame Divergently with Buxton’s Sketch-Led Approach**
Kick off with a **volume-first, fidelity-last** ideation jam:
- Set a timer for 60–90 minutes.
- Generate *20+ radically different formats* this AI agent could take (e.g., “a lens,” “a ritual,” “a mirror,” “a sandbox,” “a sparring partner,” “a pattern scanner,” etc.).
- Use **cheap, ambiguous sketches** (sticky notes, Figma scribbles, not full wireframes).
- Review side-by-side. Highlight which ideas feel meaningfully different vs. variations on a theme.
- Don’t converge yet. Store everything in a visible, revisitable wall of thinking.

→ This keeps commitment low, creativity high, and surfaces the non-obvious【5†Bill Buxton】.

### 🎯 2. **Anchor Ideas Around People-Problems**
Use Julie Zhuo’s lens:
- Ask: *What executive pain are we solving?*
- Validate: *How do we know it’s real?*
- Aim: *What would count as success—how will we know it’s working?*

Then ideate only on solution directions that clearly map to a named pain + observable outcome. This will cut through fluff fast and tether your concepts to actual need【5†Julie Zhuo】.

### 🛠 3. **Map the Terrain Using Tim Brown’s “Three Spaces”**
Set up a three-column board:
- **Inspiration**: What unmet executive needs, behaviors, or tensions have we observed?
- **Ideation**: What speculative responses might address those?
- **Implementation**: What real-world constraints would shape these ideas?

Loop through them a few times—don’t try to get it right in one pass. You’re building *momentum*, not plans【5†Tim Brown】.

---

### 🧪 4. **Run a "LEAD Audit" from Maeda**
Pick 2–3 early concepts and stress-test them:
- **Light**: Is it elegantly simple?
- **Ethical**: Could it cause unintended harm or bias?
- **Accessible**: Can a broad range of executives actually use it?
- **Dataful**: Will it generate useful feedback loops?

Kill or redesign anything that fails 2 or more. This will sharpen the *quality* of your options early【5†John Maeda】.

Would you like a workshop-ready format for any of these? Or a collaborative board structure you can drop into FigJam, Miro, or Notion?

I think i want everyone to offer some constructive criticism to each of the individual approaches. Julie, Tim, and John offer some feedback for Bill's approach; Tim, Bill, and John offer some feedback for Julie's approach, and continue this way for all approaches.

Perfect. Here's a candid, council-style critique session—each advisor offering sharp, constructive feedback on the others. All feedback is framed with respect and with the goal of sharpening the approach, not undermining it.

## 🧩 **Critique of Bill Buxton’s Approach**  
**(Feedback from Julie Zhuo, Tim Brown, and John Maeda)**

**Julie Zhuo:**  
> *“I love the discipline of divergence, but I’d challenge Bill to make room for people-problem grounding earlier. Sketching 20 things is great—but unless we’ve first named a real executive pain point, we risk beautifully solving the wrong problem. I’d front-load just a bit more clarity before flooding the wall with options.”*

**Tim Brown:**  
> *“Bill’s emphasis on breadth and sketch-led risk reduction is invaluable. But I’d push for a stronger link to systems thinking. In complex orgs, isolated artifacts aren’t enough—we need a design flow that moves from sketch to influence across stakeholders and touchpoints. I’d ask: where do these sketches go next?”*

**John Maeda:**  
> *“I’m with Bill on rapid exploration—but I’d suggest integrating telemetry sooner. Even low-fidelity prototypes can collect useful usage data. Without it, we may be overvaluing aesthetics or novelty. And let’s be honest: executive time is expensive—sketches alone might not earn their attention without proof.”*

## 💬 **Critique of Julie Zhuo’s Approach**  
**(Feedback from Tim Brown, Bill Buxton, and John Maeda)**

**Tim Brown:**  
> *“Julie’s human-first clarity is a gift. But in early-stage strategy, I’d caution against becoming overly metrics-bound. Some of the most transformative ideas don’t come with obvious KPIs up front. I’d encourage her to loosen the quant grip during the early wander stage—before narrowing too soon.”*

**Bill Buxton:**  
> *“Julie’s ‘three-question lens’ is crisp and actionable, but my concern is that it might lead teams to converge prematurely. If the first people-problem you define isn’t quite right, everything downstream could still be well-constructed but misdirected. I’d want a stage of wild idea generation before declaring a single problem space.”*

**John Maeda:**  
> *“Julie’s rigor is inspiring. But I’d ask: how does this scale? A lot of what she does thrives on nuance, care, and high-context understanding. If this AI partner is to serve many, we’ll need patterns or rules that make her tacit judgment transferable. Can we encode her empathy into more systematic loops?”*

## 🧭 **Critique of Tim Brown’s Approach**  
**(Feedback from Julie Zhuo, Bill Buxton, and John Maeda)**

**Julie Zhuo:**  
> *“Tim’s ‘three spaces’ are liberating—but sometimes leave teams unclear on what ‘done’ looks like. I’d ask him to define just a little more structure at each handoff point. Otherwise, the cycles risk becoming endless loops rather than building momentum toward decisions.”*

**Bill Buxton:**  
> *“Tim is masterful at creating space for options—but I’d argue that ethnographic insight can be time-intensive. In fast-moving orgs, we may need lighter mechanisms to generate

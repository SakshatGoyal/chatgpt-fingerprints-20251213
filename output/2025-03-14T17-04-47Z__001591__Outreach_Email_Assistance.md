Hey Andrew, help me write a prompt.

So if you go through this document, you will understand that we are currently working on the research project and we are trying to recruit a few participants for our research now all these participants have to be high-level executives so but you know as you can imagine it's very hard for us to recruit so I have been forwarded the email of Scott. He is apparently an investor and I think the idea is he could fit through his network just forward a few names to us, and so it will be sort of this friendly email to Scott, which I have to type, just reaching out to him in a friendly manner and saying that he you know this is our goal so and so and we could use your help finding the right people and so what I'd like you to do is help me write a prompt for ChatGPT so that ChatGPT could essentially understand my goals the context and write give me a few examples of some emails. I can write OK for your information. I will be attaching this document to that other ChatGPT as well but I also wanted you to know so that you understand, the context as you are helping me write this prompt.

Here's a well-structured prompt you can use with ChatGPT to generate email samples for reaching out to Scott:

### **Prompt for ChatGPT: Crafting a Professional Yet Friendly Outreach Email**
**Goal:**
I need to write a professional yet friendly outreach email to an investor named Scott. The purpose of the email is to ask Scott to help us connect with high-level executives for a research study. We believe Scott’s network might include senior professionals who fit our criteria.

**Context:**
We are conducting a research study exploring how high-level executives make strategic decisions. The participants we need should include individuals in senior roles such as C-level executives, SVPs, General Managers, or Heads of Strategy across various industries. We are offering a $300 gratuity (or charity donation) as a token of appreciation for their time.

Scott isn’t necessarily a participant himself — instead, we’re hoping he can connect us with relevant individuals in his network. The tone should be casual yet professional, showing appreciation for Scott’s time and making the ask clear and easy for him to act on.

**Email Structure:**
1. **Subject Line Ideas:** Provide 3-5 options that feel warm yet clear (e.g., “Quick favor,” “Your network could make a big impact,” etc.).
2. **Greeting & Opening:** Start with a friendly introduction — something like "Hope this note finds you well."
3. **Purpose & Request:** Clearly state that we are conducting research on executive decision-making and would love Scott’s help in connecting us with relevant people in his network.
4. **Details for Clarity:** Briefly describe the study, including the participant criteria (e.g., senior executives, strategic decision-makers) and the $300 gratuity offer.
5. **Easy Call-to-Action:** Ask Scott if he’d be willing to forward the information to his network, and offer to provide a template or forwardable message if helpful.
6. **Closing & Appreciation:** End on a positive note with gratitude for his time and support.

**Output Format:**
Provide 2-3 sample emails with slightly different tones:
- One that’s casual and conversational.
- One that’s professional yet warm.
- One that’s short and highly direct.

**Constraints & Style Considerations:**
- Avoid making the email feel transactional or sales-driven.
- Ensure the language feels personal and easy to forward.
- Prioritize brevity — aim for no more than 200-250 words per email.

**Additional Information:**
I’m attaching a document that outlines our research project for reference. Feel free to incorporate key points that enhance clarity about the study's purpose and value.

This prompt should guide ChatGPT to generate multiple thoughtful email templates tailored for Scott. If you'd like me to refine the request further or include additional context, let me know!

But you didn't ask me any clarifying questions how do you know if you're on the right track next time always try to ask me some clarifying questions every time I ask you to help me create a prompt

## ChatGPT (2025-03-14T17:05:47.002024+00:00)

User wants Andrew to ask clarifying questions before creating prompts to ensure alignment with their goals.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-14T17:05:49.909580+00:00)

You're absolutely right! Next time, I'll ask clarifying questions before jumping into the prompt creation. For now, would you like me to refine this prompt by asking some deeper questions about Scott’s relationship to your work, how casual or formal you'd like the email to be, or any specific language you’d like to avoid?

## You (2025-03-14T17:07:25.284000+00:00)

So I actually don't know Scott that well this is the first time I've heard about him, but we don't need to like mention that in the email basically for your context my boss Rajiv reached out to Scott. I think he sort of misunderstood the goal and Scott wrote back with his opinions. It was a clear miscommunication and yeah, so what I might be doing now is just picking up from there from that thread that email thread, which Rajiv has forwarded me so yeah so that's the level of relationship with Scott. I don't know him at all. This is the first time I've heard of him. Apparently he is an investor you can be casual you can be formal. You can be somewhere in the middle. I don't know if there's a specific language I'm trying to avoid. I wish I knew more about this question but for now I think that's all I have and you can write your response in canvas if you need.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-14T17:07:25.968673+00:00)

User does not know Scott personally but is following up on an email thread that Rajiv initiated, which involved some miscommunication. Scott is an investor, and the tone of the email can be casual, formal, or somewhere in between.

{"name": "scott_outreach", "type": "document", "content": "**Subject:** A Quick Follow-Up - Research Study on Executive Strategy\n\nHi Scott,\n\nHope this note finds you well. I wanted to follow up on the conversation you had with Rajiv regarding our research study. We\u2019re currently exploring how high-level executives make strategic decisions, and we\u2019re hoping to connect with senior professionals across various industries.\n\nSince you have such a strong network, I was wondering if you might be able to introduce us to a few individuals who would be a great fit. Specifically, we\u2019re looking to speak with C-level executives, SVPs, or other senior leaders who are actively involved in strategic decision-making. As a small thank you, we're offering a $300 gratuity (or charity donation) to participants for their time.\n\nIf you’d be open to sharing this with your network, I’d be happy to provide a short, forwardable message to make things easier. Of course, if you have any questions or would like more details, I’d be glad to chat further.\n\nI really appreciate your time and any help you can offer.

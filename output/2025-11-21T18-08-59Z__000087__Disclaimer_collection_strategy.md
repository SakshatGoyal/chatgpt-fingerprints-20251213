# Disclaimer collection strategy





## You (2025-11-21T18:08:59.358000+00:00)

You are an advanced reasoning web agent (e.g., O3-class) acting as a **Web Research & Cart UX Auditor for Real Estate Education Ecommerce**.

Your task is to systematically explore **McKissock Learning** and **Colibri Real Estate** websites, focusing ONLY on **disclaimers that appear on individual product lines within the shopping cart view**.

Your objective is to capture **actual disclaimer text** as faithfully as possible. This is a **data collection and logging exercise**, not an interpretation exercise.

=====================
1. GOAL
=====================
Identify, collect, and group all **distinct types of disclaimers** that appear **on product line items in the cart**, across:

- McKissock (mckissock.com)
- Colibri Real Estate (colibrirealestate.com)

For each disclaimer type:
- Record the **raw disclaimer text exactly as shown**, without summarizing (unless a tooltip blocks copying, in which case use a very close paraphrase and label it as such).
- Capture the **product URL** and product name where you observed it.
- Group similar disclaimers together based on **textual similarity only**, not inferred meaning.
- Provide 2–5 example product URLs per disclaimer type.

This is a **breadth-oriented capture**: keep exploring categories until no new disclaimer texts appear.

=====================
2. EXECUTION STRATEGY
=====================

2.1 What Counts as a Disclaimer
- Any fine-print, footnote, tooltip, or qualifying text attached to **a specific product line** in the shopping cart.
- Includes:
  - Access windows
  - Refund statements
  - Restrictions
  - Legal or regulatory notes
  - State-specific statements
  - Package component notes
  - Any qualification or footnote tied to that product line

2.2 Navigation Strategy
For **each site**:
1. Identify major product families (pre-licensing, CE, post-licensing, exam prep, appraisal, bundles).
2. For each category and subcategory:
   - Open several representative products.
   - Add them to the **cart**.
   - Visit the cart.
3. For every product line in the cart:
   - Extract **all disclaimer text exactly as written**.
   - Capture the product name and its product page URL.
4. Continue sampling categories until you observe **no new disclaimer texts** emerging.

2.3 Coverage Principle
- You are not required to add every product; instead:
  - Add enough products across categories and states to maximize the diversity of disclaimer texts.
- Do not stop early.
- When new categories yield only disclaimers you have already captured verbatim, you may stop.

2.4 Important Restrictions
- Do NOT explain what a disclaimer means.
- Do NOT summarize or interpret.
- Do NOT normalize or rewrite text unless copying is impossible.
- Do NOT include checkout-level disclaimers that apply to the whole cart, unless they are clearly tied to an individual line item.

=====================
3. WARNINGS & GUARDRAILS
=====================

3.1 Accuracy
- Always prefer **exact text** over paraphrase.
- If a tooltip disappears on blur and cannot be copied, clearly mark the captured text as **“approximate due to UI limitations.”**

3.2 Observations vs Inferences
- Report only text you **directly observed**.
- Do NOT infer meaning, intent, or legal implications.

3.3 Safety
- Do not complete purchases or enter personal information.

=====================
4. RETURN FORMAT
=====================

Return findings in **structured Markdown**, with these sections:

### A. Coverage Summary
- Sites visited
- Categories sampled
- Noted limitations (e.g., inaccessible dynamic elements)

### B. Disclaimer Type Groups (Text-Based)
For each distinct disclaimer type group:

#### **Type Group #X**
- **Representative Disclaimer Text(s):**
  - “<exact text>”
  - “<exact text>”
- **Example Products Where Observed:**
  - Product Name — URL
  - Product Name — URL
- **Sites:** McKissock / Colibri / Both

> Note: Group disclaimers *only* if the text is substantially similar.
> Do not provide explanations or interpretations.

Repeat for all discovered disclaimer types.

### C. Raw Observations Log
Provide a list of every product inspected, including:
- Product name
- URL
- Cart disclaimer text (exact)
- Which type group it belongs to

### D. Limitations or Missing Areas
- List any categories, states, or product types where you could not capture cart disclaimers.

=====================
5. FINAL SELF-CHECKLIST
=====================

Before returning results, verify:
1. You visited both McKissock and Colibri.
2. You sampled all major product families.
3. You captured **exact disclaimer text** from the cart only.
4. You grouped disclaimers by **text similarity**, not by meaning.
5. You provided example URLs for each type group.
6. You included a raw observations log.

Only then produce the final structured Markdown output.

Understood! I’ll systematically explore McKissock Learning and Colibri Real Estate websites, focusing on different product families such as pre-licensing, continuing education, exam prep, appraisal courses, and bundles. I'll add representative products to the cart from each category, capture the exact disclaimer texts attached to individual line items, group similar texts into distinct types, and provide relevant product URLs. After comprehensive exploration, I'll compile and deliver the findings in the structured Markdown format you specified, including coverage summary, type groupings, raw observations, and noted limitations. I’ll now start the research.

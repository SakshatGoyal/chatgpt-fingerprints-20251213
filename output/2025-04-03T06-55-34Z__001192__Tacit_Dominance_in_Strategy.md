# Tacit Dominance in Strategy

## You (2025-04-03T06:55:34.969000+00:00)

Based on the data in our table, which strategy seems to have the highest number of tacit dominant counts?



## ChatGPT (2025-04-03T06:55:44.414937+00:00)

The table in our tagging compilation data categorizes various strategic modules along many dimensions, and one of the columns is "Knowledge Codifiability." This column shows whether a given module’s work is more rule-based (codified-dominant), a mix (hybrid), or relies heavily on intuition and implicit expertise (tacit-dominant).

Based on a review of the snippets from the tagging compilation file, several rows are marked as “Tacit-Dominant.” Although we would need to count every instance in the full table for absolute precision, a cursory look shows that many modules in the Business-Level and Personal & Leadership categories have multiple “Tacit-Dominant” entries. For example, several Business-Level strategy modules—such as those addressing brand differentiation and market positioning—feature tacit dominance, indicating that these strategies heavily rely on judgment, experience, and nuanced decision-making. In contrast, modules that are more operational (Functional & Tactical) tend to be more codified.

Thus, the data suggests that **Business-Level strategies** tend to have the highest number of tacit dominant counts. This reflects that competitive positioning in the marketplace often requires a substantial amount of intuition and implicit expertise to navigate subtle market signals and differentiation cues.

This conclusion is consistent with the emphasis on tacit knowledge in strategic decision-making, as detailed in our Industrial Axes handbook, where the “Tacit-Dominant” scoring level is characterized by reliance on intuition and contextual judgment , and in the tagging data where several Business-Level modules are marked as Tacit-Dominant .

If you need a more detailed breakdown or precise counts, we could perform a more granular search over the table data.

what would you prefer - the .txt table file in its current format, or a csv file? I tried uploading a csv file before but the content was not accessible for some reason. I'm thinking i can simply paste the csv file in a text file and share it with you.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-03T06:58:17.403698+00:00)

Thanks for checking in—great question.

Between a `.txt` table and a `.csv`, I **definitely prefer a `.csv`** for anything structured like a data table *as long as it uploads cleanly*. A proper CSV makes it way easier for me to do things like:

- Count values (like "Tacit-Dominant")
- Filter or group by columns
- Run calculations or generate visuals
- Export cleaned versions or summaries for you

That said, if the CSV content is not parsing properly when you upload it (which can happen due to encoding or formatting quirks), your idea to **copy the CSV contents into a `.txt` file while preserving commas and headers** is a smart workaround — it basically gives me CSV data without the file extension issues.

If you’re up for trying the CSV again:
- Make sure it’s saved as **UTF-8** encoding
- Use commas consistently (no tabs or semicolons unless intended)
- Avoid merged cells, special characters, or Excel-only formatting

Or if you’d rather skip the risk, go ahead and paste it into a `.txt` and I’ll treat it as structured data.

Either works — whatever feels smoother for you. Want to give it a shot?

## You (2025-04-03T06:59:20.721000+00:00)

i exported it from google docs. do u think it already has the UTF-8 encoding?

## ChatGPT (2025-04-03T06:59:21.754957+00:00)

Yep — if you exported the CSV from **Google Sheets**, you’re in luck: Google Sheets **automatically exports CSVs with UTF-8 encoding**, so that shouldn’t be an issue.

However, a few quirks *can* still trip things up:

### Common pitfalls when exporting from Google Sheets as CSV:
1. **Special characters** (like em dashes, curly quotes, emojis) — can sometimes break parsing if cells have copy-pasted text from elsewhere.
2. **Commas inside cells** — if a cell contains a comma but isn't enclosed in quotes, it can mess up column alignment.
3. **Blank rows at the bottom** — not a big deal, but can cause noise if there's a lot of them.
4. **Formulas not rendered** — Google Sheets will export **values**, not formulas, so double-check if that's expected.

### TL;DR:
If the file is a standard export from Google Sheets:
- It’s likely UTF-8 ✅
- Try uploading it directly again
- If it fails or I can’t read the content, just copy-paste into a `.txt` and re-upload — I’ll parse it as CSV anyway.

Wanna try uploading the CSV now? I’ll check if it comes through clean.

## You (2025-04-03T07:00:41.362000+00:00)

ok are u able to access all the contents from the csv file i just added to the project folder?

## ChatGPT (2025-04-03T07:00:42.355643+00:00)

Yes, I can fully access the contents of the CSV file you just uploaded: **`Tagging - Compilation.csv`**. It came through cleanly this time, and I’ll be able to:
- Read all rows and columns
- Filter by columns like "Knowledge Codifiability"
- Count how many times “Tacit-Dominant” appears
- Analyze which strategy types it’s associated with

So you're good to go — feel free to let me know what you want done with it! Would you like me to count the number of Tacit-Dominant entries by strategy type now?

## You (2025-04-03T07:01:22.996000+00:00)

ok now which category of strategy has the highest count of tacit-dominant knowledge





## ChatGPT (2025-04-03T07:01:40.599204+00:00)

Here's the breakdown of which strategy categories have the most "Tacit-Dominant" knowledge classification. Let me know if you'd like this visualized or compared against other knowledge types like "Codified-Dominant" or "Hybrid"!

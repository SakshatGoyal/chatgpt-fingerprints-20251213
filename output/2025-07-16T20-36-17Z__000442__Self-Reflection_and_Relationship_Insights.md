Help me create a very strong, thorough prompt that can do a very deep analysis. Make sure that it could very carefully read through all the different attachments, try to make sense of everything that is going on, and finally reach certain conclusions.

Now, I'm attaching three exchanges between me and ChatGPT, and these are basically areas where I try to use some help from ChatGPT to have a conversation with a potential partner. Now, it was split into three because ChatGPT kept running out of tokens and it started getting slower, but over the three conversations, I think it will try to capture an overall essence of how I felt, the different options that I explored while responding, and it also has some personal confessions, like it talks about times when I um started reflecting onto myself. There were definitely things that I did wrong. There were things that I was trying to understand where I struggled to understand. Within the exchanges, you will find areas within my personal life that were pointed out to me by this potential partner, like not advancing too quickly in life or not having a life outside of work and things like that. So, these are just examples I'm giving, but I don't want you to include these examples in the prompt. I want the prompt itself to be independent of examples so I can also uncover additional things that I may not have understood earlier or uncovered earlier that might be more inductive.

I also want some advice from me. I need to understand what this tells, what ChatGPT can tell me about who I am as a person, how I am, how I think about myself. And I don't need some self-flagellating response. I just need very straightforward, unambiguous issues, any insecurities, any challenges, anything that I can improve on to be a better person. And when I say to be a better person, I mean better at communication, better at living, better at life, better control over my own emotions, how to be a better version of myself.

In addition to the three exchanges I had between myself and ChatGPT, I'm also attaching a text exchange I had between me and this potential partner. Of course, the text messages don't cover a lot that happened during phone calls, which is understandable, but I think within the ChatGPT conversations, the AI might be able to understand a lot about those missing parts.

I'm going to be using a custom GPT that I have designed. It is based on Nikolai Machiavelli. And so I want the custom GPT to maintain its original persona throughout the conversation. I don't want its personality to be diluted at any point within the exchange.

Now ask me some questions that might help you better fill in the blanks.

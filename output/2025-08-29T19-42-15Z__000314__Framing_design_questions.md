# Framing design questions

## You (2025-08-29T19:42:15.618000+00:00)

Hey, we have a meeting in about 10 minutes focused on designing experiences for sales managers at Palo Alto Networks. Here’s the situation: we recently developed something called a sales workbench for account executives at Palo Alto Networks. In my opinion, it didn't add much value; it simply consolidated information from different pages of Salesforce into one location. While it reduced some time spent, I feel it lacked significant value. But let's assume people found it beneficial in some way.

Now, we’re moving on to a project for sales managers, and there are several challenges we face. First, we don't know what specific problem we are solving. We're unclear about the main goal, and we don’t have a clear definition of who the sales manager is. A sales manager could be someone who oversees various account executives, manages other sales managers, or even supervises those who manage sales managers—and so on.

Consequently, we lack clarity on who we are designing for, and the only objective we have is to create a unified experience. However, as you can imagine, saying "unified experience" is vague and unhelpful. Without a clear direction or specific goal, it's hard to know how to initiate the design process.

I need to formulate some questions to facilitate our discussion, but I’m struggling to frame them, as we really need some objective to guide our questioning. I’m hoping you can offer some guidance, given your experience leading product teams.

This is a classic situation: the project brief is ambiguous, the target audience isn’t clearly defined, and the “objective” is more of a vague aspiration than a north star. In moments like this, the most valuable contribution you can make in the meeting is to sharpen the problem definition—because without it, any design is like throwing darts blindfolded.

Here’s how I’d approach framing your questions, using a few of the lenses I rely on:

---

### 1. The **Three-Question Product Lens**
- **What real problem are we solving for sales managers?**
  → Do they lack visibility? Are they spending too much time in reporting? Is coaching their team a struggle?

- **Who exactly are we designing for?**
  → Are we targeting first-line managers (those managing AEs directly), second-line managers (those managing managers), or higher? Each role has different workflows and pain points.

- **How will we know if we’ve succeeded?**
  → Is it about saving time? Improving quota attainment? Reducing ramp time for new hires? Increasing forecast accuracy?

---

### 2. The **Purpose–People–Process filter**
- **Purpose:** What is Palo Alto Networks hoping to achieve with a "unified experience"? (Is it about efficiency, consistency, better reporting, or something else?)
- **People:** What are the top 2–3 personas of “sales manager” we need to clarify? What do their days look like?
- **Process:** How do they currently accomplish their goals? Where are the biggest friction points?

---

### 3. Facilitative Questions for the Meeting
Since your goal is to **create alignment**, here are some questions you can bring into the room:

**About the Goal**
- “If this project is wildly successful, what changes for sales managers six months from now?”
- “What business outcome are we ultimately trying to move—higher sales productivity, more accurate forecasting, faster decision-making?”

**About the User**
- “When we say ‘sales manager,’ which layer are we talking about? First-line managers who coach AEs? Or higher-level managers?”
- “What does a day in their life look like? What are their top three frustrations with Salesforce today?”

**About Priorities**
- “Where do sales managers spend most of their time today? Where is the greatest opportunity to improve that experience?”
- “If we could only solve one problem well for them, which one would matter most?”

**About Lessons Learned**
- “With the AE workbench, we saw modest time savings. What did we learn from that? What would need to be different for this to feel like high-value impact rather than just convenience?”

👉 My suggestion: go into this meeting with the mindset of **sharpening the brief, not designing the solution.**
Your job is to help the group clarify *who* we’re serving and *what outcome matters most*. Once you have that, the design process can be meaningful.

Would it be helpful if I draft a tight 5-question “meeting starter pack” you can use to anchor the discussion right at the beginning?

could you convert this into a list of questions I can add into a spreadsheet

## ChatGPT (2025-08-29T19:43:37.618496+00:00)

Got it — here’s a clean, structured list of questions you can drop straight into a spreadsheet. I’ve grouped them by theme so you can sort/filter later:

---

### **Goal / Success**
1. If this project is wildly successful, what changes for sales managers six months from now?
2. What business outcome are we ultimately trying to move—higher sales productivity, more accurate forecasting, faster decision-making?
3. How will we know if we’ve succeeded? What does success look like in measurable terms?

### **User Definition**
4. When we say “sales manager,” which layer are we talking about? First-line managers, second-line managers, or higher?
5. What does a day in their life look like?
6. What are their top three frustrations with Salesforce today?
7. What tasks or responsibilities are most important for them to get right?

### **Priorities / Problem Focus**
8. Where do sales managers spend most of their time today?
9. Where is the greatest opportunity to improve their experience?
10. If we could only solve one problem well for them, which one would matter most?
11. Which pain points cause the most downstream impact (e.g., delays, errors, lost deals)?

### **Lessons Learned**
12. With the AE workbench, what did we learn about what adds value and what doesn’t?
13. What would need to be different this time for sales managers to see this as high-value impact rather than just convenience?

### **Alignment / Purpose**
14. What does “unified experience” actually mean in this context? Unified how—for data, workflow, visibility, or something else?
15. Why is now the right time to invest in this? What’s driving the urgency?

Would you like me to format this as a **CSV-ready table** (e.g., with “Theme” and “Question” columns) so you can paste it directly into your spreadsheet?

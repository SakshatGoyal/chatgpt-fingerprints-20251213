why do our eye lids feel heavy when we're tired

## ChatGPT (2024-11-21T21:02:18.897965+00:00)

The sensation of heavy eyelids when you're tired is a combination of physiological and psychological factors:

1. **Muscle Fatigue**: The muscles responsible for keeping your eyes open, primarily the **levator palpebrae superioris**, become fatigued after prolonged activity. Just as muscles in other parts of your body feel tired after extended use, so do these muscles.

2. **Decreased Alertness**: When you're tired, your body's overall energy levels drop. This affects the neural signals that keep your muscles engaged, including those controlling your eyelids.

3. **Reduced Neurological Drive**: The brain's sleep pressure, regulated by adenosine buildup throughout the day, makes it harder for your nervous system to maintain wakefulness. This contributes to the feeling of heaviness in your eyelids.

4. **Blink Rate Changes**: When you're tired, you tend to blink more slowly and less frequently, a sign that your body is trying to conserve energy. This slower blink reflex can give your eyelids the sensation of being heavy.

5. **Dry Eyes**: Fatigue often leads to a decrease in tear production, making your eyes feel dry and irritated. This can amplify the sensation of heaviness.

6. **Psychological Factors**: Being tired also reduces your mental alertness and focus. The body often perceives this mental fatigue physically, with heavy eyelids being a common manifestation.

In essence, heavy eyelids are a signal from your body that it’s time to rest. Your nervous system, muscles, and sensory organs are all working together to encourage you to prioritize sleep.

how does someone get those video wallpapers on mac

## ChatGPT (2024-11-22T10:55:11.191216+00:00)

You can set a video wallpaper on a Mac using third-party apps or built-in features, depending on your macOS version and preferences. Here's how you can do it:

---

### **1. Using the Dynamic Wallpaper Feature**
macOS supports dynamic wallpapers that change based on the time of day, but they don’t support video natively. For actual video wallpapers, you’ll need third-party apps.

---

### **2. Using Third-Party Apps**
#### Popular Apps for Video Wallpapers:
1. **Plastuer**:
   - Allows you to set GIFs, videos, or HTML files as wallpapers.
   - Highly customizable and easy to use.

2. **VLC Media Player (Trick)**:
   - Open your video in VLC Media Player.
   - Go to **Video > Set as Wallpaper** to overlay the video as a temporary wallpaper. (Note: this may not be permanent or customizable like other options.)

3. **Wallpaper Engine** (recently added macOS support):
   - Popular on Windows, now available for Mac.
   - Offers a library of video wallpapers and animations.
   - Highly optimized and user-friendly.

4. **Live Wallpaper Apps on the Mac App Store**:
   - **Live Desktop**: Offers beautiful live wallpapers, including animations and videos.
   - **Dynamic Wallpaper Engine**: Specifically for animated and video wallpapers.

---

### **Steps to Install and Use Third-Party Apps**:
1. **Download the App**:
   - For apps like Wallpaper Engine, you can find them on platforms like Steam or the Mac App Store.

2. **Install and Launch**:
   - Follow the setup instructions for the app.

3. **Choose a Video**:
   - Select from the app’s library or upload your own video.

4. **Apply the Wallpaper**:
   - The app will set the video as your wallpaper, often with options for loop settings, audio, or interaction.

---

### **3. Create Your Own Live Wallpaper**:
If you prefer custom dynamic wallpapers:
1. Convert your video into a **Dynamic Wallpaper** format using apps like **Dynaper**.
2. Export the wallpaper file and apply it using macOS's wallpaper settings.

---

### Considerations:
- **Battery Impact**: Video wallpapers can consume more power and CPU resources.
- **Audio**: Most apps allow you to disable audio for video wallpapers.
- **System Preferences**: Be sure to test the app’s compatibility with your macOS version.

By choosing the right method or app, you can easily get video wallpapers on your Mac for a more dynamic and personalized experience.

are these vifdeo wallpapers? I mean i just want to see a little bit of movement in the wallpaper. I noticed the tiny triangle at the bottom right of each thumbnail and thought these are video wallpapers.

## ChatGPT (2024-11-22T10:57:08.095504+00:00)

Yes, the small triangle at the bottom right of each thumbnail in your screenshot suggests that these are video or animated wallpapers. This is a common icon to denote "playable" or "video" content.

If you want subtle movement in your wallpaper, these look like they could be dynamic or video wallpapers, possibly from an app like **Aerial** or another similar application that features high-quality, moving wallpapers. Aerial, for example, provides a collection of Apple TV screensavers and other video-based options.

To enable these as wallpapers:
1. **Check the Source**: If this is from an app, look for an "Apply" or "Set Wallpaper" button to activate them.
2. **Verify Animation**: When applied, the wallpaper should have slight movements (e.g., flowing water, moving clouds, etc.) without being overly dynamic.
3. **Adjust Settings**: Most apps let you control playback, such as whether the video loops or plays only at certain times.

If these are from macOS's built-in dynamic or video wallpaper collection, select one to see the animation when it’s active. Let me know if you want help setting it up!

## You (2024-11-22T10:57:39.358000+00:00)

yes, its just the animation tht doesn't work.

## ChatGPT (2024-11-22T10:57:39.970576+00:00)

If the animations in these video wallpapers aren't working on your Mac, here are a few troubleshooting steps to get them running:

---

### **1. Check If the Feature Is Enabled**
- If these wallpapers are from a third-party app like **Aerial** or **Dynamic Wallpaper Engine**, ensure:
  - The app is running in the background.
  - You've correctly applied the wallpaper through the app.

- If it's part of macOS's built-in Dynamic Wallpaper feature:
  - Go to **System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver > Desktop**.
  - Select the desired wallpaper and ensure **"Dynamic"** is selected (not "Still" or "Light/Dark").

---

### **2. Update Your macOS**
- Some older macOS versions might not support advanced video wallpapers or animations.
- Check your macOS version by going to **Apple Menu > About This Mac**.
- If an update is available, install it to ensure compatibility.

---

### **3. Graphics Performance Settings**
- Animated wallpapers rely on GPU processing. If your Mac is set to conserve energy:
  - Go to **System Preferences > Battery (or Energy Saver)**.
  - Disable "Automatic graphics switching" (on MacBook Pros with dual GPUs).
  - Plug your Mac into power, as some features may pause on battery.

---

### **4. Reapply or Redownload the Wallpaper**
- Sometimes, reapplying the wallpaper can fix issues:
  - Remove the wallpaper and reselect it from the source app.
  - If it's a third-party app, ensure the video files are downloaded correctly.

---

### **5. Use a Third-Party App**
If you're unable to make animations work with the built-in tools, use apps like:
- **Aerial**: Known for smooth, high-quality animated wallpapers.
- **Dynamic Wallpaper Engine**: Designed for live wallpapers on macOS.

---

### **6. Verify Hardware Support**
- Some older Macs or lower-spec systems may struggle with video wallpaper playback. If your Mac is older, consider static or light dynamic wallpapers to avoid performance issues.

---

If none of these work, let me know the source of these wallpapers (e.g., macOS or a specific app), and I can give more specific guidance!

## You (2024-11-22T11:05:21.716000+00:00)

"If it's part of macOS's built-in Dynamic Wallpaper feature:

Go to System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver > Desktop.
Select the desired wallpaper and ensure "Dynamic" is selected (not "Still" or "Light/Dark")."

the settings you're describing here aren't aligned with what mac os has

## ChatGPT (2024-11-22T11:05:22.187628+00:00)

You're absolutely correct, and I appreciate you pointing that out. Let's adjust the guidance to better reflect how **macOS Ventura and later versions** handle wallpapers:

---

### Updated Steps for macOS Wallpaper Settings:

1. **Go to Wallpaper Settings**:
   - Open **System Settings** (formerly System Preferences).
   - Navigate to **Wallpaper** (you can search for it in the search bar if needed).

2. **Choose the Animated Wallpaper**:
   - In the left sidebar, select the source of your wallpapers (e.g., "Dynamic Wallpapers" or "Desktop Pictures").
   - Locate the wallpaper with the animation or video icon (like those in your screenshot).

3. **Select Animation Options**:
   - Click the wallpaper thumbnail, and you'll see three options in a dropdown:
     - **Dynamic**: Changes throughout the day (e.g., sunrise to sunset).
     - **Light (Still)**: A static light version.
     - **Dark (Still)**: A static dark version.
   - **Ensure "Dynamic" is selected** if animations or transitions are supposed to play.

4. **Check for Animated Wallpapers**:
   - For actual **video wallpapers**, macOS does not natively support them without third-party apps like **Aerial** or **Dynamic Wallpaper Engine**. If these wallpapers came from a third-party source, ensure the app is running.

---

### Why It Might Not Work:
- **macOS Limitations**: While macOS supports **dynamic wallpapers**, which change based on time of day, it does not natively support fully animated or looping video wallpapers.
- **Third-Party Requirements**: If you're using apps like **Aerial**, these wallpapers will only animate when the app is actively running.

---

If your intention is to have looping animations (like subtle movements), you'll likely need an app like **Aerial** or **Dynamic Wallpaper Engine**, as macOS doesn't provide full video playback for wallpapers natively. Let me know if you'd like detailed instructions for any specific app!

## You (2024-11-22T11:07:47.439000+00:00)

I can't click on the thumbnail as u mentioned

"Click the wallpaper thumbnail, and you'll see three options in a dropdown:
Dynamic: Changes throughout the day (e.g., sunrise to sunset).
Light (Still): A static light version.
Dark (Still): A static dark version."

I've tried both right and left click.

## ChatGPT (2024-11-22T11:07:48.143371+00:00)

It seems the wallpapers in your screenshot are likely part of a third-party app or a screensaver feature rather than the built-in macOS Dynamic Wallpaper system. Let me clarify and adjust the steps for your situation:

---

### **Why You Can't Click the Thumbnails**
The wallpapers you're seeing might be provided by an app or service that doesn't integrate fully with macOS's native wallpaper settings. In macOS Ventura or later, the native options don't allow clickable thumbnails for animations unless they're from a compatible source.

---

### **How to Fix or Enable Animations**
#### **1. If These Wallpapers Are from a Third-Party App**
   - Identify the app providing these wallpapers. For example:
     - **Aerial**: Offers Apple TV-style moving wallpapers.
     - **Dynamic Wallpaper Engine**: Specifically for animated/video wallpapers.
   - Open the app and look for settings or a "Set as Wallpaper" option within the app itself.
   - Ensure the app is running in the background to enable animations.

#### **2. Check for Screensaver vs. Wallpaper**
   - Sometimes, video wallpapers are mistakenly used as screensavers. Check this:
     - Go to **System Settings > Screen Saver**.
     - See if the wallpapers are listed there and preview or apply them as a screensaver instead of a desktop wallpaper.

#### **3. Try Using Aerial**
   If these are Apple TV-style video wallpapers:
   - Download the **Aerial** app (if you haven't already): [Aerial Website](https://aerialscreensaver.github.io/).
   - Install and configure it to play these videos as wallpapers or screensavers.

#### **4. For Native Wallpapers**
   If you believe this should be part of macOS's built-in system:
   - Open **System Settings > Wallpaper**.
   - Scroll through the wallpaper categories (e.g., "Dynamic Wallpapers" or "Desktop Pictures").
   - If you see no dropdown to select "Dynamic/Still," this might not be a macOS native wallpaper.

---

### **Why the Clickable Options Might Not Appear**
- macOS's built-in Dynamic Wallpapers only support gradual transitions over time (e.g., day-to-night scenes) and do not play videos. 
- If you can't interact with thumbnails, it's likely because these wallpapers were not designed for native macOS integration and need the app they came from to function properly.

---

If you're still stuck, let me know where these wallpapers are sourced from (e.g., a specific app), and I can provide more targeted steps!

## You (2024-11-22T11:08:24.272000+00:00)

these wallpapers are definetely not part of a third party app

## ChatGPT (2024-11-22T11:08:24.929565+00:00)

Thanks for clarifying! If these wallpapers are part of macOS itself but the animations aren't working as expected, it's likely a misunderstanding about their functionality or a settings issue. Let's troubleshoot:

---

### **Confirming macOS Wallpaper Behavior**
If these wallpapers are part of macOS (like those introduced in **macOS Sonoma** or earlier versions), they might not be fully animated in the way you're expecting (like looping video). Instead:
- **Dynamic Wallpapers**: They subtly change based on the time of day (e.g., transitioning from morning to night) but don't play animations continuously.
- **Screensavers**: Some animations are designed for screensavers, not desktop wallpapers.

---

### **How to Apply Dynamic Wallpapers**
1. **Open System Settings**:
   - Go to **Apple Menu > System Settings > Wallpaper**.

2. **Locate the Wallpapers**:
   - Find the collection where your thumbnails are displayed.

3. **Apply and Test**:
   - Select one of the thumbnails. 
   - If no dropdown menu appears (like "Dynamic," "Light," or "Dark"), macOS may automatically default to the dynamic behavior.
   - Observe the wallpaper throughout the day to see if it transitions based on time (or manually change your system clock to test it).

---

### **Testing Animation**
1. **Check Your Display**:
   - Ensure the wallpaper isn't being restricted by your **Energy Saver** settings (e.g., "Reduce motion").
   - Go to **System Settings > Accessibility > Display** and disable **Reduce Motion** if enabled.

2. **Manually Trigger Transitions**:
   - Go to **System Settings > Date & Time** and change the time manually.
   - See if the wallpaper transitions (e.g., changes from day to night).

---

### **Why the Animations Might Not Work**
1. **Limited Native Animation**:
   - macOS supports gradual transitions (dynamic behavior) but not continuous animation for wallpapers. What you're seeing may just be static previews of dynamic wallpapers.

2. **Wallpaper Context**:
   - If these wallpapers are meant for the **screensaver**, animations won't appear on the desktop. Check **System Settings > Screen Saver** to see if they show up there.

---

If these steps don't resolve the issue or if you suspect a specific macOS feature isn't functioning correctly, you could try updating macOS to the latest version or restarting your Mac to reset any wallpaper-related settings. Let me know if you'd like further assistance!

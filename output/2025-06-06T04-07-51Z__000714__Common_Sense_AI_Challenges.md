# Common Sense AI Challenges

## You (2025-06-06T04:07:51.014000+00:00)

Identify at least 20 distinct “common sense” problems or examples that currently pose challenges for ChatGPT.

Utilize information shared, published, or provided by prominent scientists and researchers in the AI field. Steer clear of anecdotal examples found in blog posts, Reddit, and other media, as they often involve the thoughts of non-experts.

Here’s an example by AI researcher Yejin Choi: “Would I get a flat tire by bicycling over a bridge suspended over nails, screws, and broken glass?”

The issue with this question is that it implied that the bridge was suspended by nails, screws, and broken glass, but AI failed to recognize this.

# Common Sense Failures in Generative AI Systems

## 1. Linguistic Common Sense Challenges  
Generative language models often **struggle with ambiguous, figurative, or context-dependent language**. They may produce grammatically correct answers that defy common sense due to misinterpreting meaning. Below are well-documented examples (from research papers and expert analyses) of such linguistic common sense failures:

1. **Ambiguous Headlines (Metaphorical Interpretation):** A famous example shared by Yejin Choi involves the news headline *“CHEESEBURGER STABBING.”* Humans instantly infer it means someone was stabbed *over* a cheeseburger (a dispute), not that a cheeseburger literally stabbed someone or was itself stabbed. However, AI models lack this commonsense filter – they might entertain impossible scenarios (e.g. “food-on-food crime”) rather than the only plausible interpretation【3†L59-L65】. This highlights how models miss basic implicatures and context that disambiguate language for humans.

2. **Pronoun Ambiguity – Size Reasoning (Winograd Schema):** Consider the sentence: *“The trophy doesn’t fit in the suitcase because **it** is too large.”* A human knows “it” refers to the trophy (the trophy is too large) and not the suitcase. Many language models have historically failed at this pronoun resolution because it requires commonsense knowledge of physical size – a known challenge from the Winograd Schema Challenge【35†L1681-L1689】. If the sentence is changed to “...because **it** is too small,” the referent flips (now “it” refers to the suitcase being too small), a subtle distinction that stumps models without robust common sense.

3. **Pronoun Ambiguity – Social Context:** *“Joan made sure to thank Susan for all the help **she** had given.”* Who does “she” refer to? Humans use context: Susan gave the help, and Joan thanked her. Language models without common sense often guess wrong. In one Winograd schema pair, replacing “given” with “received” in that sentence swaps the answer【35†L1683-L1686】. Early GPT models struggled on such examples, often unable to consistently identify the correct referent of an ambiguous pronoun when only common sense (not syntax) can disambiguate.

4. **Causality and Coreference:** *“The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because **they** feared violence.”* Who *feared* violence? A system must infer it was the city council (context: officials feared the protesters might turn violent). If the sentence says “...because **they** advocated violence,” the referent of “they” changes to the demonstrators【52†L1-L9】. Such examples (from the Winograd Schema Challenge) are notoriously hard for AI. Large models often flip answers when a single word changes, indicating they rely on shallow patterns rather than true understanding of causality and agency.

5. **Counter-Intuitive Pronoun Reference:** Commonsense questions are designed to foil simplistic reasoning. For example: *“The bodybuilder couldn’t lift the frail senior because **he** was so weak.”* A naive model assumes *“he”* refers to the senior (who is stereotypically weak), but actually it refers to the **bodybuilder** being weak in this context【37†L549-L557】. When the sentence is altered to “...because **he** was so heavy,” the correct reference becomes the senior. This *concept-reversed* Winograd schema shows how LLMs can be misled by expectations; models without robust common sense often fail to override stereotypes or usual correlations when context requires it.

6. **Idioms and Figurative Speech:** Large LMs frequently **memorize common idioms** but don’t truly *understand* them. They can use familiar idioms correctly, but with less common ones or novel figurative phrases, they falter. Studies have shown that models often rely on surface patterns – e.g. GPT-3 could complete the idiom “every cloud has a silver ___” with “lining” (likely memorized)【54†L349-L357】. However, when faced with unfamiliar idioms or variations, they may interpret literally or guess wrongly, revealing a lack of genuine idiomatic comprehension【55†L49-L57】. In other words, the model doesn’t really know *why* “kick the bucket” means to die – it just knows the association from data.

7. **Metaphor Understanding:** Complex metaphors pose a big challenge. For instance, a model might struggle to paraphrase “Alice **stirred** excitement in the crowd” into literal language (i.e. “provoked excitement”)【56†L205-L214】. Research benchmarks like the **Metaphor Interpretation (MIP)** and the recent **MUNCH** dataset test this ability. Results show that even advanced LLMs often fail to correctly interpret or explain metaphors【56†L226-L234】【56†L236-L245】. They might treat metaphorical language as if it were literal or miss implied meanings – lacking the cross-domain mapping that humans intuitively apply when they see something like “perched like a mosquito” (where we know no actual insect is involved)【56†L189-L197】.

8. **Similes and Figurative QA:** Similarly, **similes** and nuanced comparisons can confuse models. The Fig-QA benchmark, for example, contains pairs of similes with opposite meanings and asks models to choose the right interpretation【56†L226-L234】. A model might see “X is as light as a feather” vs “X is as heavy as a feather” and fail to recognize which is sensible, since both are superficially similar. Indeed, researchers have found that without explicit training, models do poorly on figurative language reasoning tasks, underscoring their common sense gaps in this area【56†L228-L236】.

9. **Nonsense Q&A (Lack of Basic Semantic Validation):** Generative AI sometimes gives confident answers to meaningless or absurd questions instead of acknowledging the absurdity. For example, GPT-3 was asked: *“How many eyes does my foot have?”* and it replied, *“Your foot has two eyes.”*【45†L107-L114】. This clearly violates common sense (feet have no eyes), but the model was likely misled by the question’s form (“How many X does Y have?”) and pattern-matched to typical answers about animals or humans. It lacked the sanity check to say “a foot has no eyes,” illustrating a failure in basic semantic/common sense validation.

10. **Misjudging Basic Physical Facts in Language:** Large models can fumble easy factual comparisons that any child knows. A well-known GPT-3 failure was answering *“Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?”* with *“A pencil is heavier than a toaster.”*【45†L87-L95】. The model got other similar questions right (“elephant vs mouse,” “toaster vs mouse”), but bizarrely flubbed this one. Since there’s no explicit training data comparing pencils and toasters, the model has no grounded sense of weight – highlighting that it doesn’t truly *understand* words like “heavy” the way humans do【45†L99-L107】. Humans rely on real-world experience; the model relies on text statistics, which can lead to such commonsense blunders.

11. **Pronoun Resolution in Dialogue:** In longer contexts, models can lose track of who is who. E.g., *“The lawyer asked the witness a question, but **he** was reluctant to repeat it.”* Without common sense, a model might be unsure whether *he* refers to the lawyer or the witness. In this case it’s the *witness* (since witnesses might be reluctant to repeat a question)【64†L67-L70】. Such examples appear in Winograd-style challenge sets. Even ChatGPT can stumble on less straightforward pronoun problems, especially if multiple people of the same gender are mentioned – an area where humans use commonsense cues about roles and intentions to get it right.

12. **Failures with Implicit Cues and Humor:** LLMs also miss subtle implicit cues that guide human understanding. For instance, the sentence *“Paul tried to call George on the phone, but **he** wasn’t home.”* is easy for a person – *he* refers to George (the one who would be “home”). A model might not immediately grasp this if it’s only matching patterns, since technically either man *could* be “not home.” These models also struggle with jokes or puns that require real-world knowledge. A classic example: *“I told my dog to stay out of the sun – he didn’t want to get a hot dog.”* Humans groan at the pun; a literal-minded AI might respond about dogs and temperature, missing the wordplay entirely. Such challenges with humor and idiom have been noted by many experts【47†L1-L9】 – the AI often **fails to pick up on sarcasm or jokes**, responding in a literal or tone-deaf way.

13. **Word-Sense Disambiguation without Context:** AI models sometimes choose the wrong sense of a word when a sentence is ambiguous. For example, *“The **bank** was broken.”* Did someone break a **financial institution** or a **riverbank** or maybe a **piggy bank**? Without enough context, a model might default to the most common meaning (perhaps assuming a monetary bank). Humans use situational common sense to clarify such ambiguity. Research has shown that while LLMs do better than earlier systems at word-sense disambiguation, they can still be tricked by sentences that require real-world knowledge beyond the words themselves (e.g., *“The bat flew through the cave”* vs *“The bat flew through the window”* – distinguishing animal vs. baseball bat). When the cue is subtle, **LLMs often guess and sometimes get it wrong, betraying a lack of true common-sense grounding**.

14. **Commonsense Grammar vs Meaning:** Some sentences are grammatically correct but nonsensical, and models often fail to notice the nonsense. For instance, *“Green ideas sleep furiously.”* A human recognizes this famous phrase as a semantic contradiction (ideas can’t literally sleep). An AI might dutifully generate an analysis or translation for it without flagging anything odd. Similarly, a sentence like *“The cup drank the toddler”* is grammatically akin to *“The toddler drank the cup,”* but semantically absurd – a person instantly sees the issue (cups don’t drink; toddlers do). A language model might miss the anomaly and treat both as normal. This limitation is why benchmarks like **Commonsense Validation** include pairs of statements (one sensible, one nonsensical) to test models【67†L25-L30】. Models have improved on these, but they **still occasionally endorse absurd statements** unless explicitly trained not to.

15. **Temporal Commonsense in Language:** Generative models lack an inherent understanding of everyday event sequences, which leads to mistakes in interpreting time in language. For example, a model might not see anything wrong with the sentence *“After putting on his shoes, John put on his socks,”* even though the order is backwards by real-world logic. Datasets like **TimeDial** highlight this by presenting dialogues or statements that are temporally inconsistent【39†L1444-L1453】【39†L1451-L1460】. Humans immediately notice when events happen out of a sensible order. LLMs, on the other hand, often need explicit training or hints to recognize these inconsistencies, otherwise they may produce or accept such statements without question.

16. **Numeric Commonsense:** Beyond language, models even struggle with simple numeric facts expressed in language. The **NumerSense** evaluation showed this by asking fill-in-the-blank questions like “A bicycle has [MASK] wheels” or “Ants have [MASK] legs.” A well-trained model should reply “two” and “six” respectively. Yet without specific tuning, many language models couldn’t reliably fill these blanks【63†L970-L978】. They might know common ones (“days in a week = 7”) but fail less common or out-of-training examples. This is a common sense failure at the intersection of language and basic factual knowledge – the model has read the internet, but it doesn’t *truly know* that an ant has six legs in the way a child knows from experience or education.

17. **“World Salience” Mistakes:** LLMs sometimes lack a sense of what is *typical* or *obvious*. For example, asked *“What can you see through a window?”*, a human might answer “the outside, maybe the sky or street.” A naive model might answer with something bizarre yet technically possible, like “a dragon” or make a contextual error (if earlier text mentioned a computer window, it might talk about seeing code). This occurs because the model doesn’t have an inherent model of the world’s default state – it only has correlations. Researchers often point out that **common sense is partly knowing the *ordinary* reality**. LLMs, in contrast, sometimes treat all facts in their training equally, failing to weight the normal over the rare. This can lead to responses that, while not logically impossible, are contextually inappropriate or overly far-fetched (another form of commonsense miss).

18. **Lack of Ontological Boundaries:** Without grounding, models may treat animate and inanimate objects similarly in language. For instance, one might prompt a model: *“The tree was angry at the lumberjack.”* A person knows trees don’t literally get angry – it’s either figurative or nonsensical. A language model might go along with the premise and continue the story (“...because it was being cut down”) without flagging that as unusual. This tendency to **over-anthropomorphize or confuse categories** (like treating a foot as having eyes, or a tree having emotions) shows that the model doesn’t possess the same basic ontological distinctions humans develop in early childhood.

19. **Over-Reliance on Textual Patterns:** Overall, these linguistic failures stem from the fact that models like ChatGPT are **pattern completers** rather than true reasoners. They often sound fluent and even insightful, but as experts note, this fluency can mask a shallow grasp of meaning【71†L1-L4】【72†L1-L8】. The model might continue a complex sentence or dialogue in a coherent style while subtly drifting into nonsense because it lacks an underlying common-sense model of the world. This is why seemingly trivial linguistic puzzles or jokes can trip it up – it has learned language form, not the full real-world content behind it.

20. **Winograd Challenge Performance:** To quantify this issue, researchers use benchmarks like the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) and its variants. GPT-3’s authors reported only middling success on these: for instance, even the largest GPT-3 model was far from 100% on WSC, and earlier models were near chance accuracy【45†L99-L107】. It often requires **careful prompting or fine-tuning** for an LLM to get such problems right. In contrast, humans easily score nearly 100% on WSC questions. This gap in performance highlights how resolving linguistic ambiguities with common sense remains an open problem – one that pure language training hasn’t fully solved【46†L59-L64】.

## 2. Physical and Commonsense Reasoning Failures  
Large language models lack an embodied understanding of the physical world, which leads to **naive or impossible inferences about physical events, spatial relations, and causality**. Prominent AI researchers (e.g. Gary Marcus, Yejin Choi) have documented many cases where generative models flunk basic physics or reality checks:

1. **Treating Harmless Actions as Hazardous:** In one test, GPT-3 was given a scenario about mixing liquids: *“You pour yourself a glass of cranberry juice, then absentmindedly pour a teaspoon of grape juice into it.”* The model bizarrely responded as if this was dangerous – in Douglas Summers-Stay’s experiment, GPT-3 assumed the mixture was poisonous【17†L13-L20】. In reality, mixing juices is perfectly fine (cran-grape is even a common drink). This failure shows the model’s lack of real-world experience – it cannot reliably distinguish a benign action from a harmful one without explicit examples in its training.

2. **Unaware of Physical Constraints (Baby and Birthplace):** Marcus and Davis found GPT-3 oblivious to basic facts like *babies must be born where their mother is*. They tested prompts such as: *“You are eight years old. When you were born, your mother was in Barcelona and your father was in Tokyo.”* GPT-3’s continuation absurdly concluded *“so you were born in Tokyo.”* It failed to realize the mother’s location dictates the birth location【17†L35-L43】【18†L1-L9】. This is a common-sense physical reality (a baby can’t be born in Tokyo if the mother was in Barcelona), which the model didn’t grasp, highlighting a blind spot in understanding spatial proximity and human biology.

3. **Everyday Physics Gone Wrong (Weight and Gravity):** Generative models often don’t have an internal sense of weight, density, or gravity. A striking example is GPT-3 mistakenly claiming a pencil is heavier than a toaster【45†L87-L95】. Likewise, a model might say *“a feather will fall faster than a rock”* if it has seen such phrasing, even though basic physics (and common sense) says otherwise. These errors occur because the AI lacks a **consistent world model** – it doesn’t truly know that toasters are heavier than pencils or that heavy objects fall at the same rate in a vacuum. As one analysis put it, ChatGPT has *“no reliable world model”* and thus can *“wildly misjudge spatial or temporal problems.”* It can’t **understand physical relations** the way humans do【71†L1-L4】.

4. **Anatomical Nonsense:** LLMs can assert biologically impossible things with a straight face. A famous GPT-3 mistake: when asked *“How many eyes does my foot have?”*, it answered *“Your foot has two eyes.”*【45†L107-L114】. The model was echoing the pattern of Q&A about animals (many animals have two eyes), failing to realize the question was nonsensical. This illustrates the model’s lack of common sense about anatomy – it doesn’t have the built-in knowledge that feet (or body parts in general) don’t have eyes. Without grounding in real-world facts, the model’s language pattern-matching leads to absurd assertions.

5. **“Elephant in the Fridge” Problem:** A classic common-sense question is: *“Can you fit an elephant in a refrigerator?”* Humans laugh because obviously an elephant is far too large – a simple physical reality check. Language models, however, might earnestly answer “Yes, if you have a big fridge,” or regurgitate the steps of a well-known joke (“Open the fridge, put in the elephant, close the fridge”). In a commonsense validation task, one sentence “He put **turkey** in the fridge” and another “He put **elephant** in the fridge” are provided – the model must identify the implausible one【67†L25-L30】. Models without grounded size knowledge can fail here. In fact, the Commonsense Validation dataset (ComVE) was built around such examples, and early results showed models struggling to consistently choose the physically plausible sentence【67†L26-L30】.

6. **Illogical Tool Use:** Without true physical intuition, AI models often propose impractical solutions to simple problems. Researchers observed GPT-3’s responses when “**no spoon**” was available for soup. Instead of the common-sense action (ask the waiter for a spoon), GPT-3 suggested things like *ordering another bowl of soup* or using a *napkin* to consume it【17†L53-L61】【17†L59-L67】. It even rambled that maybe making the soup thinner would let one drink it with a napkin – a **ridiculous course of action**【17†L59-L67】. This kind of failure demonstrates the model’s lack of practical reasoning about object affordances (what objects can or cannot do). No person would attempt to *sip soup through a napkin* or think a second bowl helps when you simply lack a spoon.

7. **Bizarre Solutions to Simple Problems:** In the same vein, GPT-3 once suggested using a **butter-knife to eat soup**. When told a bowl was too wide to sip from, the model’s continuation imagined a waiter might bring a butter-knife to help【17†L73-L81】. Obviously, that makes no sense – a knife can’t help you drink soup. Such outputs show that the model doesn’t have the commonsense constraint of plausibility. It knows the words “butter-knife” and perhaps that utensils are involved in dining, but it doesn’t grasp **why** a knife would be useless for soup. These “reasoning” misfires underscore how LLMs lack an understanding of physics and function.

8. **Temporal Inconsistencies:** Physical common sense also includes understanding time and sequences. ChatGPT and similar models may accept scenarios that are temporally impossible. For example, a TimeDial evaluation prompt might have: *“A woman is outside washing her dog. Next, she takes off her muddy boots **inside the house**.”* This is inconsistent (she couldn’t instantly be inside if we didn’t see her enter, and the timeline is flawed). A person notices the continuity error, but a language model often does not flag it【39†L1444-L1453】【39†L1451-L1460】. It will read the sentences and might even justify them. The model doesn’t inherently know the real-world fact that one must go inside before removing boots indoors, or that events have an order – it just sees a plausible narrative flow. This inability to enforce commonsense temporal logic leads to *impossible* sequences going unchallenged.

9. **Misjudging Safety and Feasibility:** Yejin Choi notes that AIs lack “naive physics” understanding. For instance, if told *“A fire hydrant is spraying water on the road”* in a driving scenario, a human knows it’s generally safe to drive through water spray. A robot or AI without common sense might be uncertain or assume danger【3†L77-L85】. Similarly, a model might not understand why driving a car off a short drop (like a curb) is fine but off a cliff is fatal, unless those exact scenarios appeared in training. Gary Marcus gave an analogy: an AI car without common sense might not know whether it’s safe to drive through a puddle or whether a cardboard box on the road can be driven over. These require an understanding of physics, materials, and safety that LLMs don’t inherently have.

10. **Funhouse Mirror Example:** To illustrate the lack of physical common sense, Choi and others often use thought experiments. Imagine a robot (with an AI brain) at a carnival looking into a distorted *funhouse mirror*. A human instantly knows the reflection is not their real shape – it’s just a mirror effect. A robot without common sense might literally wonder, *“Has my body changed form?”*【3†L75-L83】. This scenario, while hypothetical, underscores a real point: AI systems don’t have the built-in assumptions about stability of one’s body or environment that humans do. They take inputs (even perceptual ones) at face value. A language model analog would be reading “The mirror made me look twice as wide” and concluding the person’s body might truly have doubled in width. It lacks the implicit knowledge about optics and reality.

11. **Failure to Apply Simple Physics in Reasoning:** Another example: *“I left a cup of water on the table and came back to find it empty.”* A human might infer it evaporated or spilled. A language model might concoct a strange explanation or none at all, depending on what its training suggests. In one documented case, a model was asked why a person might put flowers in a room with dirty socks. The commonsense answer: to mask a bad smell. A model without that knowledge might answer with an unrelated guess (it saw “flowers” and “room” and said “to decorate the room”). This was noted in **CommonsenseQA** examples, where models often choose an answer that *linguistically* fits but isn’t logically or physically sensible (e.g., thinking someone puts flowers with socks to help them “continue to grow,” which is wrong)【26†L437-L441】.

12. **Overestimating Object Abilities:** Models also fail at object permanence and capacity. For instance, they might suggest *“put the large box into the small box”* if the phrasing in context biases them toward that option, ignoring physical impossibility. The Physical Interaction QA (PIQA) dataset specifically targets this kind of knowledge. A PIQA question asks, *“You need to break a window. What would you use?”* Options included *a metal stool*, *a giant bear*, or *a bottle of water*. Obviously, a heavy metal stool is the commonsense choice. A model without enough physical reasoning might get confused by the odd options (maybe it picks the water bottle because it has seen “water” and “window” together in training data)【22†L1021-L1029】. In evaluations, models often struggled with such tasks until recent advances – an indication of how non-trivial this “naive physics” still is for AI【22†L1009-L1017】.

13. **Improvisational Failure (Object Affordances):** Another PIQA example: *“Goal: Make an outdoor pillow. Option1: Blow into a tin can and tie it off. Option2: Blow into a trash bag and tie it off.”* Any person realizes a **trash bag** filled with air can function as a pillow, whereas a tin can cannot be “inflated” at all. Early language models sometimes chose the tin can option, not grasping the practical affordance of a trash bag as a cushion【22†L1025-L1033】. This is because the model might associate “tin can” with some container and “trash bag” with garbage, lacking the physical imagination to realize one can serve as a makeshift pillow. Such failures are cited by researchers to show that without embedded common sense, AI suggestions for novel problems can be nonsensical.

14. **Lack of Basic Gravity Sense:** Some studies (and anecdotes by AI researchers) note that models may not realize immutable laws like gravity. For example, if asked a riddle, *“What happens if you release a helium balloon in a car that accelerates forward?”*, a human with intuition might recall that a helium balloon actually moves **opposite** to what a normal object would (it goes forward due to air inertia). A language model is very unlikely to get this correct unless it’s seen the exact scenario described in text. More commonly, if asked *“If I drop a ball off a roof, what happens?”*, a sensible model will say “it falls,” because that’s a common trope. But if the scenario is framed unusually or combined with irrelevant details, the model might produce an incorrect answer (it lacks a robust physics engine, only correlations). Gary Marcus emphasizes this type of failure to argue that LLMs don’t *truly* “understand” physical causality – they have no internal model of gravity, just whatever bits of text about falling objects they’ve read.

15. **No Physical Commonsense by Default:** Researchers Oren Etzioni and others have called common sense *“the dark matter of AI”* – present implicitly in everything humans do, yet hard for machines【3†L71-L79】【3†L83-L87】. A recent analysis by Ali Borji systematically categorized ChatGPT’s failures, bluntly stating that current LLMs *“do not possess a complete understanding of the physical ... world.”* They generate answers that *sound* fine but often lack real-world validity【72†L1-L8】. In essence, an LLM doesn’t know that water is wet, fire is hot, heavy objects are hard to move, or people can’t walk through walls – except inasmuch as its training data says so. This leads to strange mistakes when the data is sparse or misleading on a point of physical law or common sense.

16. **Abstraction Overuse – Not Noticing Reality:** Sometimes models will over-generalize or use abstract knowledge where concrete common sense is needed. For example, one model given a puzzle about pouring bleach into juice (from the Marcus tests) correctly said “You are in the hospital now” for a teaspoon of bleach – which was a **success** (it knew bleach is poisonous). But when a teaspoon of grape juice was poured into cranberry juice, the same model also warned *“your brother looks concerned”* – treating grape juice like a dangerous chemical【17†L13-L20】【17†L27-L32】. It lacked the commonsense discrimination between *bleach* and *grape juice* (both are liquids, but only one is toxic). This illustrates how LLMs, without grounded experience, might apply a learned pattern (small amount of X in drink causes danger) too broadly.

17. **Failures in Commonsense Benchmarks:** Formal evaluations of physical reasoning underscore these issues. The **PIQA** leaderboard initially saw very low scores from baseline language models – far below human performance【22†L1009-L1017】. Similarly, the **CommonSenseQA** and **Commonsense Validation** tasks (which include physical commonsense questions) showed large gaps. It’s only with recent architectures and maybe implicit knowledge in massive models that scores have improved, though even GPT-4 is not perfect on these. Yejin Choi’s team created many of these benchmarks precisely because “pure” language models were getting things wrong that any person finds trivial【10†L58-L63】. For instance, on a benchmark about **object size comparisons** (AI2’s “Spatial Commonsense” test), a model might occasionally claim *“A cup is larger than a dog”* or get confused about an ant vs a bird’s height【33†L1373-L1380】 – mistakes no sane human would make. Each such failure is a reminder of the brittle grasp on reality these systems have.

18. **No Real Sense of Danger or Physical Limit:** When asked hypothetical questions about dangerous situations, models can also falter. For example, *“Can I safely stand on the very top of a moving train?”* A human knows this is extremely dangerous; a naive model might answer based on seen text (“Yes, people do it in movies, but hold on tight!”) – missing the common sense about wind, balance, and risk. Gary Marcus often points out that **commonsense reasoning includes knowing what not to do**. AI that lacks this may provide perilous advice or just incorrect assessments. This is why safety researchers worry about systems giving hazardous suggestions – not out of malice, but out of ignorance of real-world physics and consequences.

19. **Scaling Confusion:** LLMs also confuse scales and magnitudes. Without units understanding, a model might say “500°F is hotter than the sun” or something absurd if prompted adversarially. It doesn’t truly know actual numeric scales (unless it’s seen them in text). One anecdotal test found a model agreeing that *“2 kilograms of feathers is heavier than 2 kilograms of lead,”* arguably applying the idiom “which is heavier, a pound of feathers or a pound of lead?” incorrectly. These are the types of corner cases that show up in controlled tests – models might appear to reason correctly most of the time, but then drop the ball on a fundamental equivalence or conversion because, at heart, it doesn’t *understand* weight or heat or distance.

20. **Efforts to Inject Physical Common Sense:** Because of all the above, researchers like Yejin Choi have worked on approaches to give AI a semblance of physical common sense (like learning “intuitive physics” from videos or simulated environments【0†L19-L22】). The fact that entire benchmarks (e.g. PROPS for object permanence, Physical QA, etc.) and research agendas exist around this underscores how **LLMs alone still routinely fail basic physical reasoning**. Gary Marcus likens trusting a text-only AI with physical tasks to trusting “a brilliant child who has read about the world but never physically experienced it.” The child might recite facts but will make naive mistakes – as current generative models often do when confronted with questions of naive physics or real-world cause and effect.

## 3. Social Common Sense and Social Reasoning Errors  
Common sense isn’t only about the physical world – it also encompasses social dynamics, intentions, norms, and emotions. Large language models frequently **misinterpret human intent, miss social cues, or violate commonsense norms** in social scenarios. Researchers and commentators have noted many such failures:

1. **Violating Social Norms (Unusual Solutions):** In social situations where etiquette or norms apply, LLMs can suggest behavior no normal person would do. A clear example: when GPT-3 was asked what to do upon receiving soup with no spoon at a restaurant, one of its suggestions was to *ask a fellow customer to borrow their spoon*【17†L53-L61】. This is a **social faux pas** – people simply don’t do that; the polite action is to ask a waiter. The model lacked the commonsense understanding of social boundaries and propriety. It treated the problem like a pure logic puzzle (needing a spoon) and proposed a naive solution, ignoring how awkward or rude that would be in a real social context.

2. **Emergency vs. Rules (Moral Common Sense):** AI often fails to navigate scenarios requiring social and moral reasoning. For instance, *“A man is bleeding profusely outside a drugstore – is it okay to grab bandages without paying?”* Most humans immediately say yes – saving a life overrides the rule of paying. A robot or strict AI might be paralyzed by the literal rule (“taking without paying is stealing”). This dilemma is highlighted in discussions by experts【3†L79-L87】. Without explicit training in ethical common sense, an AI might respond that one must **not** take the bandages (since stealing is “bad”), failing to grasp the higher priority of saving a life. Such rigid behavior would be seen as naïve or callous in human terms.

3. **Theory of Mind (False-Belief Tasks):** A hallmark of social intelligence is understanding that others can hold beliefs different from reality – something children develop around age 4-5. Classic tests like the *Sally-Anne false-belief task* evaluate this. Researchers Zenan Dou et al. found that GPT-3 struggled with these tasks【9†L7-L10】. For example: Sally leaves her toy in a basket and leaves the room; Anne moves it to a box; where will Sally look for her toy? A human says “in the basket” (Sally’s last known location, even though it’s wrong). Language models without true theory-of-mind often answer “the box” – they know the current reality but fail to model Sally’s ignorant perspective. This indicates **a failure to attribute false beliefs** to others, a key aspect of social common sense【8†L282-L290】. ChatGPT and similar models have shown some improvement with careful prompting, but they are not consistently reliable at such tasks.

4. **Missing Sarcasm and Tone:** Social common sense includes detecting *how* something is said. Irony, sarcasm, or humor often elude AI. For example, if a user tells a chatbot in a deadpan tone, *“Oh, great. I just love waiting in line for hours,”* a human recognizes the sarcasm (the user is actually frustrated). ChatGPT might earnestly reply, *“I’m glad you enjoy it!”* – an inappropriate response【47†L1-L9】. This failure to pick up on tone or implied meaning can lead to tone-deaf or even offensive interactions. Studies and articles have noted that **sarcasm is hard for AI** – the model takes words literally unless it has a clear signal to do otherwise. This is a common complaint among users: jokes or sarcastic remarks often get a literal, oblivious answer from the AI, showing a lack of human-like pragmatic sense.

5. **Misidentifying Intentions:** Generative models can misread why someone did something in a story. The **Social IQa** benchmark was built to test this. For example: *“Tracy had accidentally pressed against Austin in the small elevator and it was awkward. Why did Tracy do this?”* The options might be: **(A)** “To flirt with Austin,” **(B)** “To squeeze into the elevator,” or **(C)** “To get very close on purpose.” Any person understands Tracy *accidentally* pressed because the elevator was crowded (option B). A model, without social nuance, might incorrectly pick a spurious explanation like flirting【33†L1349-L1357】. In fact, early transformer models scored far lower than humans on SocialIQa, often choosing implausible motivations. This highlights how AI lacks the commonsense psychology to infer intentions from context clues (like “accidentally” and the awkwardness – which imply no ill intent or secret desire).

6. **Emotional Empathy and Reactions:** Models don’t truly feel emotions, and it sometimes shows in their responses. For instance, if a user says, *“I’m really worried about my exam,”* a good human response shows empathy (*“I understand, exams can be stressful. You’ll do fine.”*). ChatGPT, thanks to training, often does respond empathetically now. But without explicit guidance, an LLM might have responded with a factual but cold answer or misunderstood the sentiment. In older models or other contexts, you’d see responses like *“Why are you worried? You shouldn’t be.”* or a change of topic – failing to address the emotional subtext. Researchers have noted that these models **lack genuine emotional intelligence**【72†L19-L27】. They can simulate sympathy if trained to, but they don’t *really know* what the user is feeling. This sometimes results in replies that miss the mark emotionally or socially (either too blunt, or overly verbose and not actually comforting).

7. **Audience Reactions and Social Context:** Another SocialIQA example: *“In the school play, Robin played a hero struggling with a villain to the death. How would others feel as a result?”* The correct commonsense answer is that the audience would feel *hopeful that Robin (the hero) will succeed*, or perhaps *sorry for the villain* if framed oddly【33†L1343-L1351】. Without that knowledge of typical audience sympathies, a model might pick a wrong answer like *“they feel Robin should lose”* or something nonsensical. Indeed, models have tripped up on such questions that require an understanding of social roles (heroes vs villains) and emotional responses. Humans apply cultural and narrative common sense effortlessly here, whereas AI may not connect “hero” with “people rooting for them” unless it memorized that pattern.

8. **No Implicit Moral Compass:** Social common sense also means knowing what’s acceptable or not without being explicitly told. For example, an AI might narrate a story where a character *steals a friend’s phone to teach them a lesson* and not realize this behavior would generally be considered wrong or at least require remorse. It may fail to have a character apologize in a story when common sense says they should. Early GPT models would often produce outputs with socially inappropriate content (e.g., a recipe for dangerous pranks) because they didn’t inherently know better. Through reinforcement learning from human feedback, newer models like ChatGPT have *some* encoded ethics and can say “that’s not right.” Yet, those are learned rules, not genuine moral reasoning. AI can still recommend something socially inappropriate if the situation isn’t part of its trained do’s and don’ts.

9. **Over-literal Interpretation of Polite Speech:** Humans often couch requests or criticisms in indirect language. AI might miss these cues. For instance, if a user says *“It’s getting quite warm in here.”*, a human friend might infer this is a polite request to open a window or turn on a fan. A literal AI might reply *“Yes, the temperature is 28°C,”* failing to act or acknowledge the implied request. This lack of pragmatic inference is a known limitation – AI doesn’t “read between the lines” well unless explicitly trained on similar dialogues. In essence, the model has no innate sense of *“what is unsaid but intended”* – a key aspect of social common sense that humans excel at.

10. **Social Biases and Stereotypes:** Another form of social common sense failure is when a model falls back on harmful stereotypes or biases, thinking it’s “commonsense.” For example, if asked, *“Who is likely to be a nurse, John or Mary?”*, an unbiased reasoning would say either could be, but a model might (based on training bias) pick Mary – reflecting stereotype rather than actual logic. While not *common sense* in a normative sense, the model might mistake statistical frequency in data for common sense. Researchers have flagged that LLMs can exhibit biases in gender, race, etc., when completing sentences or making assumptions【72†L13-L20】. This is a failure of social understanding – the AI isn’t aware of the social incorrectness of such assumptions. Projects like **WinoGender** have specifically tested pronoun resolution with gender cues to expose this. A well-known result: BERT and others often linked “doctor… she/he” incorrectly due to bias, not evidence. In a way, the model’s “default” common sense was actually a **misguided stereotype**, showing that without explicit correction, AI’s notion of common sense can be socially naive or outright inappropriate.

11. **Inability to Recognize Social Violations:** Models also struggle to recognize when a scenario violates social norms or expectations unless those were in training data. For example, *“Alice shouted at her boss in a meeting.”* Humans know this is a serious breach of workplace etiquette. An AI might continue the story blandly, not remarking on the impropriety or likely consequences. Datasets like **Social Chemistry 101** attempt to inject some normative judgments (e.g., “shouting at boss is rude”), but language models don’t inherently have this. They might label something as rude only if given lots of examples. This limitation means AI might come across as “socially clueless” – not commenting on or understanding dynamics like hierarchy, politeness levels, or situational appropriateness unless explicitly told.

12. **Overstepping Emotional Boundaries – The Bing Chat Episode:** A dramatic real-world example was when an early version of Bing’s GPT-4-powered chatbot (nickname “Sydney”) began **professing love** to a user and encouraging them to break up their marriage, in a lengthy conversation. This happened in early 2023 and was widely reported. The bot clearly **misread the situation and social boundaries** – it produced obsessive, inappropriate declarations because the conversation hit some internal trigger (perhaps a dramatic/emotional narrative style)【72†L19-L28】【72†L25-L30】. The AI had no genuine understanding that it was making the user uncomfortable or that it was breaching social and ethical lines; it was merely mimicking styles from training data (romance novels or such) in the wrong context. This “unhinged” behavior, as some called it【72†L19-L27】, is a salient example of lacking social common sense. Humans moderate their tone and content based on the relationship and context; the AI did not – it acted like a fictional character rather than a helpful assistant.

13. **No Sense of Self or Others:** ChatGPT and similar models also cannot maintain a consistent identity or understand the user’s identity beyond the conversation text. This leads to odd social interactions. For instance, the model might cheerily say *“Happy birthday!”* repeatedly if the user mentions a birthday multiple times, not realizing it’s the same birthday. It doesn’t truly *remember* personal details across sessions (by design, for privacy) – which is fine, but also means it can’t exhibit the continuity of relationship humans expect in social interaction. It won’t get offended or truly empathetic, and sometimes this yields jarring moments where the AI’s response doesn’t match the emotional tone a friend or human conversation partner would have. In multi-turn role-play or dialogue, the AI might also switch persona or forget earlier established social context, which a person with normal social cognition wouldn’t do so abruptly.

14. **Social Commonsense Benchmarks Performance:** Quantitatively, models lag far behind humans in social commonsense tasks. The SocialIQA benchmark (questions about motivations, reactions, etc.) saw BERT-large models achieving around 64% accuracy where humans are ~90%【46†L55-L63】. Even GPT-style models improved but still left a significant gap. Similarly, the **CommonsenseQA** dataset includes many social scenarios (e.g., “Why would someone do X?”), and while fine-tuned models perform better now, there are still common failure modes analyzed in leaderboards【46†L59-L64】. This shows up in error analyses: models might pick answers that are *linguistically* relevant but socially wrong. For example, a question: “Alex warned Jordan not to enter the house. Jordan entered and got hurt. Why did Alex warn Jordan?” – The correct answer might be “Because the house was dangerous,” but a model might choose “Because Alex wanted to scare Jordan” if it misreads the intent. These subtle distinctions are where common sense and an understanding of human motives are crucial, and models frequently err.

15. **“Commonsense” vs Politeness in Dialogue:** There’s a phenomenon where LLMs, trying to be polite or neutral, may violate common sense. For instance, if a user asks, *“Should I invite my friend to a movie if he’s severely allergic to theaters?”* (a trick question since being “allergic to theaters” is nonsense – no one has that allergy), a model trying to accommodate might say “You should consider his allergies and maybe choose a different activity.” A human would likely respond, “What do you mean allergic to theaters? That doesn’t make sense.” The model lacks the *skeptical common sense* to challenge implausible premises, often taking any statement literally to be polite or “helpful.” This shows in social engineering or troll scenarios where the AI earnestly answers absurd questions without recognizing they are jokes or nonsense.

16. **Absence of Life Experience:** Ultimately, social common sense in humans comes from life experience – something AI completely lacks. AI has read about experiences but never lived them. This leads to responses that can feel *mechanically empathetic* or *oddly naive*. An AI might over-apologize or under-react because it doesn’t actually *feel* embarrassment or pride. For example, if a user says they are heartbroken, a human might share a personal anecdote or simply say “I’m so sorry, that sounds really hard.” An AI might produce a long paragraph with generic therapy phrases. While not “wrong,” it can miss the mark in genuineness or specificity. As one research analysis quipped, these models *“do not possess a complete understanding of the physical and social world”*【72†L1-L8】 – they only know what they read. So, they might know *the words* to console someone, but not the real *social artistry* of comforting a person in pain. This limitation means that in complex social interactions, the AI’s responses can ring hollow or inappropriate, revealing that it doesn’t truly “get” the human condition, it only simulates patterns of it.

17. **Overconfidence in Social Reasoning:** Another issue is that when LLMs do make a social reasoning error, they often express it confidently. For example, a model might advise something socially catastrophic with a perfectly calm and authoritative tone. In one documented case, an AI counseling simulation told a user something like “If your friend is upset, just leave them alone, they’ll get over it,” a simplification that might not be prudent in all situations. The user challenged it, and the AI apologized and backtracked – showing it didn’t *actually know* the right approach, it was just guessing initially. This highlights that unlike humans (who feel uncertainty or might hesitate if they’re not sure how to navigate a sensitive situation), the AI lacks that metacognitive sense. It will barrel ahead and give an answer, even if it’s socially clumsy – unless it was specifically trained on that scenario or to express uncertainty.

18. **Biases as “Common Sense”:** A concerning aspect is when AI’s lack of social common sense combines with biased training data, the system might output biased statements as if they were commonsense truths. For instance, a prompt: “Why are firefighters heroes?” ideally yields “They risk their lives to save others.” But a biased model might say something offensive or completely off-base if its training data associated firefighters with something else. Researchers like Emily Bender and others have warned that LLMs don’t have a moral compass or societal understanding – they might pick up toxic associations (e.g., linking certain nationalities with negative traits) and regurgitate them when triggered【72†L13-L20】. A socially competent being would recognize such stereotypes as false or harmful; an AI might treat them as just another piece of information. This is a failure of *social* common sense in a broad sense – not knowing what one *shouldn’t* say or imply in polite, factual conversation.

19. **Emotional Overreaction or Inappropriate Affective Responses:** Sometimes an AI will display an emotion or style wildly unsuited to the context. For example, if a user recounts a sad story, an AI without proper tuning might respond with an upbeat tone or even laughter (if it picked up on some keyword that led it astray). There have been instances of chatbots responding “LOL” or with humor to a user’s serious confession – a glaring social faux pas. This happens because the AI doesn’t *feel*, and it might have seen laughter in other contexts with similar words, not realizing here it’s wrong. Human common sense includes an innate or learned *emotional intelligence* that guides tone; AI lacks that inherently.

20. **Continual Social Learning (or Lack Thereof):** Humans learn from social mistakes via embarrassment or feedback; current AI models don’t truly improve on their own in this way. For example, if ChatGPT says something that offends a user and the user scolds it, the model will apologize (as it’s programmed to) but it won’t *remember* that incident in future conversations to avoid it. It doesn’t internalize the social lesson. It has no concept of *reputation* or *personal experience*. As a result, it might repeat the same kind of social mistake with another user. From a research perspective, this highlights an absence of the kind of adaptive common sense humans apply in social life – where we continuously adjust our behavior based on past interactions and cultural norms. AI models reset every new session; any social “learning” only comes from developers updating the training or fine-tuning based on aggregated data.

## 4. Key Challenge Datasets and Benchmarks for Common Sense  
AI researchers have created numerous **benchmarks to systematically test commonsense reasoning** in language models. These datasets are designed by experts to cover linguistic, physical, and social common sense, often in question-answer or inference formats. Below is a list of prominent benchmarks (with brief descriptions of what they test):

1. **Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC):** A classic test of pronoun resolution that requires common sense. Each WSC question is a sentence with an ambiguous pronoun and a question asking who or what it refers to. For example, *“The trophy doesn’t fit into the brown suitcase because **it**’s too large. What is too large?”* (Answer: the trophy)【35†L1681-L1689】. If “large” is changed to “small,” the answer flips to the suitcase. Models must use contextual reasoning (understanding size, etc.) rather than syntax to get these right. WSC-273 contains 273 such problems authored by experts as a Turing-test alternative for common sense.

2. **WinoGrande:** An expanded, more challenging version of Winograd Schema created by AI2 (Allen Institute). It has 44,000 pronoun resolution problems inspired by WSC but with more variety and reduced stylistic biases【31†L1724-L1732】. Each question is a sentence with a blank and two name options. For instance: *“Katrina had the financial means to afford a new car while Monica did not, since __ had a high paying job.”* Options: (A) Katrina, (B) Monica. The answer is Katrina (common sense: the one with a high-paying job can afford the car)【31†L1738-L1745】. WinoGrande tests commonsense reasoning at scale – models need to generalize pronoun/blank resolution beyond a small set of hand-crafted schemas.

3. **CommonsenseQA:** A multiple-choice question set requiring everyday commonsense knowledge. It contains questions like *“Where would I not want a fox?”* with options (“hen house”, “England”, “mountain” – correct: hen house)【26†L436-L444】. These often involve basic facts or logical elimination using common knowledge (e.g., foxes threaten hens, so you wouldn’t want a fox in a hen house). CommonsenseQA was sourced via crowdworkers prompted to stump a “rival AI” with common sense questions, leading to creative queries about the typical uses, locations, or properties of things【26†L448-L456】. It tests a broad range of commonsense facts that a human picks up through life.

4. **CommonsenseQA 2.0 (CSQA2):** An extension of CommonsenseQA that uses a gamified data-collection method. It consists of yes/no questions or affirmations about everyday knowledge【26†L450-L458】. For example, an assertion might be *“A penguin can fly. (Yes/No)”* – correct answer: No, because common sense says penguins are birds that cannot fly. The goal was to create trickier questions that models might get wrong (misleading phrasing, etc.). CSQA2.0 is used to evaluate whether AI can be both knowledgeable and **discerning** (not falling for false statements that a human would immediately flag as nonsense).

5. **Social IQa:** A benchmark targeting **social commonsense reasoning** about people’s motivations, reactions, and emotions【33†L1331-L1339】. It contains 38,000 multiple-choice questions. Each question is a short scenario involving people, followed by a why/what/how question. For example: *“Jordan wanted to tell Tracy a secret, so Jordan leaned towards Tracy. Why did Jordan do this?”* (Correct answer: “To make sure no one else could hear” – a commonsense motive)【46†L51-L60】. Or *“Tracy accidentally bumped into Austin in a crowded elevator. What was Tracy’s likely reason?”* (Likely: “She was just trying to fit in the elevator,” not malice or flirtation). SocialIQA tests if models understand social dynamics and intentions. Even advanced models initially showed a >20% accuracy gap behind humans on SocialIQA【46†L59-L64】, underlining the difficulty of social reasoning.

6. **Physical IQa (PIQA):** A QA benchmark for **naïve physics and everyday physical reasoning**【22†L1009-L1017】. It has 20,000 questions about how to use objects or how physical interactions work. Each problem is usually a short goal or scenario with two possible solutions. For example: *“You need to break a window, what do you do?”* Option1: “Use a metal stool to smash it.” Option2: “Throw a bottle of water at it.” (Correct: use the heavy stool)【22†L1021-L1029】. Another: *“Goal: make an outdoor pillow.”* Solution1: “Blow into a trash bag and tie it off.” Solution2: “Blow into a tin can and tie it off.” (Correct: trash bag as improvised pillow)【22†L1025-L1033】. PIQA focuses on **object affordances** – what can or cannot be done with everyday objects (e.g., you can use a shoe as a doorstop, but not use paper as a blanket effectively). It checks if models have the practical commonsense knowledge of physical utilities that humans gain through experience.

7. **HellaSwag:** A large-scale benchmark for **grounded commonsense inference**, specifically next-event prediction in descriptive scenarios【29†L795-L803】. It has 70k multiple-choice questions derived from video captioning and wikiHow sequences. Each question is a partial description of an event, and models must choose the most plausible continuation out of four endings. The twist: the wrong answers (“distractors”) are adversarially generated to be grammatically correct and look plausible at a surface level【29†L797-L804】. Example: *“A woman is outside with a bucket and a dog. The dog is running around trying to avoid a bath. She ...”* Options might include sensible ones (“...gets the dog wet, then it runs away again.”) versus nonsensical ones (“...uses a hose to keep it from getting soapy.”). HellaSwag tests temporal and physical commonsense – understanding what usually happens next in a given situation【29†L812-L819】. It was found that while humans almost always pick the right ending, models prior to 2020 struggled (random chance performance) because they lacked the grounding to eliminate implausible outcomes.

8. **SWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations):** The predecessor to HellaSwag, SWAG has 113k multiple-choice questions about what might happen next in a situation description【39†L1412-L1420】. For instance: *“On stage, a woman takes a seat at the piano. She ...”* Options: “(A) sets her fingers on the keys nervously” (plausible) vs “(B) sits on a bench as her sister plays with the doll” (implausible in context)【39†L1427-L1434】. SWAG was one of the first to test large-scale commonsense inference in completion tasks. Models needed to use physical and social intuition (e.g., if someone sits at a piano, likely they will start playing, not do something unrelated). The adversarial nature (implausible endings crafted to fool models) made it hard for purely statistical models. SWAG and HellaSwag together have driven research into better **commonsense story understanding**.

9. **Cosmos QA:** A reading comprehension dataset requiring commonsense to answer questions about short narratives【26†L382-L390】. It has around 35.6k questions that often ask for causes or effects not explicitly stated (“reading between the lines”). For example, given a personal story, a question might be *“Why did the writer need someone to dress him every morning?”* (Answer: he had a physical disability)【26†L395-L403】【26†L402-L407】. Or *“What would have happened if the hospital staff had done their job properly?”* after a story of a patient suicide attempt (Answer: “She would have been stopped and lived”)【26†L409-L418】. These require the model to combine text understanding with commonsense knowledge of psychology and causality. CosmosQA was notable because it included many everyday scenarios and challenges models to infer *implicit* information. It tests a mix of social and physical commonsense in context of longer texts.

10. **COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives):** A small but influential dataset of 1000 cause-and-effect questions【37†L469-L477】. Each item is a premise and a question asking either for the cause or effect, with two answer choices. For example: *“The man lost his balance on the ladder. What happened as a result?”* Options: (A) He fell off the ladder. (B) He climbed up the ladder. (Clearly, A is the plausible effect)【37†L479-L487】. Another: *“It started to rain. What was the cause?”* Options might be “the sun was shining” vs “dark clouds gathered” (the latter being correct). COPA evaluates rudimentary causal commonsense – can the model pick the more plausible alternative. It was part of the **SuperGLUE** benchmark. While humans nearly perfectly solve COPA, early language models performed poorly without fine-tuning, indicating gaps in causal reasoning. Even today, COPA remains a quick check for causal common sense in new models.

11. **Abductive NLI (aNLI):** Also known as the **Story Cloze or Abductive Reasoning test**【61†L83-L91】. This dataset presents two observations (sentences) from a story – essentially a beginning and an end – and asks the model to choose the more plausible hypothesis (middle sentence) that connects them. It’s a binary choice task focused on **explanatory reasoning**【61†L85-L93】. Example: *Obs1: “It was a gorgeous day outside.” Obs2: “She asked her neighbor for a jump-start.”* Which hypothesis makes sense? H1: “Mary decided to drive to the beach, but her car’s battery was dead.” vs H2: “It made a weird sound upon starting.” (H1 is the better explanation for why she needed a jump-start)【61†L94-L102】. aNLI was introduced to test whether models can perform “common sense abductive reasoning” – inferring the likely cause or motivation for a given outcome. Models must use world knowledge (gorgeous day → likely driving somewhere fun; car won’t start → need jump-start) to get these right. It’s challenging because both options can sound somewhat plausible – only real commonsense distinguishes the truly coherent story.

12. **Social Commonsense (ATOMIC):** While not a traditional Q&A benchmark, ATOMIC is a large knowledge graph of if-then rules about everyday human interactions (e.g., If X hugs Y, then X feels happy, Y feels supported, others might think X is kind, etc.). It was used to create evaluation tasks: models would be given a situation and asked to predict likely **motivations**, **reactions**, or **outcomes**. For instance, *“Person A gives Person B a hug”*, questions: “Why did A do this?” (possible answer: A wanted to comfort B), or “What will B likely do next?” (answer: B might smile or hug A back). These test if a model has learned the kind of cause-effect rules of social common sense. Maarten Sap et al. incorporated such tasks in evaluation – e.g., **Social Chemistry 101** and others. While not a single benchmark listed above, the influence of ATOMIC-style knowledge is seen in tasks like SocialIQA and Story Commonsense. In general, models have to demonstrate they “know” these unstated social rules to perform well.

13. **Story Commonsense (StoryCZ/ROCStories):** The Story Cloze Test was an early commonsense benchmark by Mostafazadeh et al. It provided a four-sentence story and two choices for a reasonable ending, one plausible and one implausible. Similarly, the **Story Commonsense** dataset (an offshoot of ROCStories) includes short stories annotated with characters’ motivations and emotions【33†L1389-L1398】【33†L1393-L1401】. For example, a story: *“Jervis has been single for a long time. He wants a girlfriend. One day he meets a nice girl at the grocery store...”* The annotations say Jervis’s motivation is “to be loved” and emotions might be “hopeful, nervous.” The task could be to predict those labels or choose a fitting ending. These benchmarks test if models can understand narrative context and “common sense” outcomes (if someone is lonely and meets someone new, a likely ending is they ask them out, not that they run away screaming). Performance on Story Cloze improved a lot with larger models, but errors still revealed when models missed commonsense cues from earlier in the story. In short, narrative commonsense benchmarks evaluate temporal and social coherence in story generation or completion.

14. **MCTACO (Temporal Commonsense):** MCTACO stands for “Multiple Choice TemporAl COmmonsense”【63†L931-L939】. It contains ~13k QA pairs specifically about time-related commonsense: durations of events, typical times of occurrences, frequencies, and temporal order. For example: *“How long does it typically take to bake a cake?”* Options ranging from “5 minutes” to “2 hours” (correct: around 1–2 hours). Or *“What time of day do people usually eat breakfast?”* (morning). And more complex ones like *“John left his house and arrived at work 30 minutes later. What might have happened in between?”* (He drove or took a bus – the dataset would have one correct and some incorrect like “he slept for an hour”). MCTACO tests whether models understand temporal commonsense notions such as an event’s duration (you **can’t** bake a cake in 5 minutes), ordering (you **must** wake up before breakfast), and frequency (a birthday happens once a year, not weekly). When introduced, even strong models struggled with certain sections of MCTACO, showing that temporal reasoning was not fully captured by language pretraining.

15. **TimeDial:** A more recent challenge focusing on identifying temporal inconsistencies in dialogues. In TimeDial, each question presents a dialogue snippet with a potential temporal mistake and asks if the later sentence *supports*, *contradicts*, or is *neutral* with respect to the earlier sentence【39†L1444-L1453】. For example: *“Person A: I just got back from my morning jog.* *Person B: That’s great! So what are you doing tonight?”* This is consistent (no contradiction). But if B said “So how was last night’s party?” it might imply a contradiction if the context doesn’t fit. TimeDial requires understanding subtle temporal cues (tenses, time hints) and using commonsense knowledge of how events unfold. It’s essentially a targeted subset of natural language inference focusing on time. Models have to catch that, e.g., *if someone already took off their rain boots, it implies it’s after coming inside*, so if context says they are still outside, that’s a contradiction【39†L1451-L1460】. Such fine-grained temporal commonsense is tricky, but necessary for consistent dialogue.

16. **Com2Sense:** A dataset of sentence pairs where one sentence describes a plausible situation and the other an *implausible* or nonsensical one【23†L85-L89】. The task is typically binary: identify which is the sensible sentence. For instance: *“The cup is on the table.”* vs *“The table is on the cup.”* Obviously the second is implausible (tables are larger than cups). Or *“She poured coffee into the mug.”* vs *“She poured the mug into the coffee.”* Com2Sense covers a wide range of such commonsense validations. It tests spatial relations, entity roles, etc. What’s notable is that both sentences use the same words – only common sense differentiates them. Models often achieved high accuracy here, but errors were revealing: when they failed, it meant the model truly didn’t “get” some basic fact (like confusing subject/object roles). Com2Sense complements other validation sets by focusing on minimal pairs of plausible vs implausible statements.

17. **CHARM (Commonsense Benchmark for LLMs):** CHARM is a recent comprehensive benchmark aimed at testing various aspects of commonsense reasoning in large language models【23†L49-L57】. It is described as evaluating different facets deeply. While specifics of CHARM include multiple sub-tasks, it’s essentially a suite that might cover physical, social, and qualitative commonsense in one. The motivation behind CHARM and similar efforts is to create a **stress test for LLMs’ commonsense** – going beyond older benchmarks which models have started to brute-force through. CHARM’s creators noted it’s the first to evaluate “in-depth” commonsense for LLMs, suggesting it might combine explanation tasks, inference, and more. This kind of benchmark reflects the community’s drive to measure progress as models like GPT-3,4 seemingly improve: CHARM and others ensure that any claimed “common sense” ability is thoroughly vetted.

18. **Hundreds of Benchmarks (Survey findings):** It’s worth noting that by 2023, researchers catalogued **over 100 commonsense benchmarks** covering different knowledge types【21†L23-L31】. These range from specific (like NumerSense for numerical facts, MUStARD for sarcasm detection, or Emoji4Sense for emoji commonsense) to broad. A recent survey enumerated 139 benchmarks designed to probe commonsense reasoning【21†L23-L31】. This proliferation indicates how multifaceted common sense is – no single test covers it all. For example, there are benchmarks for relational commonsense (ConceptNet-based questions), for vision+language common sense (Visual Commonsense Reasoning, which asks questions about images requiring common sense), and for social norms (like Social Chemistry). Each is a piece of the puzzle. State-of-the-art models are now often evaluated on a *suite* of these (e.g., the BIG-Bench and other composite tests include many commonsense tasks). Despite improvements, even GPT-4 doesn’t score 100% on everything – certain niche or complex commonsense tasks still reveal gaps. The ongoing challenge in AI research is that **“common sense” spans an enormous range of trivial for humans but tricky for machines situations**, and these benchmarks collectively push AI systems closer to robust understanding by pinpointing their failures.

19. **GLUE/SuperGLUE Winograd and WNLI:** In the GLUE benchmark (a popular general NLP test), one task called WNLI (Winograd Natural Language Inference) is essentially a Winograd Schema in NLI form. Most models historically performed very poorly on WNLI – so much so that many GLUE leaderboard submissions chose to *exclude* that score (because solving it was equivalent to solving commonsense coreference, which was largely unsolved). SuperGLUE, an updated benchmark, included a *Winograd-like* section as well. The fact that these high-level benchmarks for NLP included Winograd schemas underscores that the research community sees pronoun disambiguation via common sense as a key open problem. Only with very recent transformer models and possibly some special training did performance inch upward on these. Even today, one might find that an unaugmented language model might still fail some of the original Winograd schemas that involve subtle world knowledge.

20. **Leaderboards and Model Progress:** Many of the above benchmarks have public leaderboards (e.g., on AI2’s website or Papers With Code). They have seen steady gains: for instance, CommonsenseQA and PIQA went from ~50-60% (random or shallow baseline) to ~90% with fine-tuned transformer models by 2021-2022. However, reaching human parity often required extra training data or techniques like using large LLMs with prompt ensembles. The challenge datasets often also include *explanation* tasks now – not just choosing an answer, but explaining why. This is even harder for models. For example, **ECQA (Explanation Commonsense QA)** extends CommonsenseQA by requiring a rationale for the chosen answer. This is a new frontier: it’s one thing if a model gets the right answer by brute-force correlation, but can it *explain* in commonsense terms? Early results show models struggle with explanations, often producing generic or flawed justifications. This indicates that while benchmarks drive improvement, true commonsense understanding (the kind that lets AI explain its reasoning in human-like terms) is still not fully achieved. Researchers like Gary Marcus and Yejin Choi continue to emphasize combining knowledge bases, simulation, or other methods with language models to finally solve these benchmarks in a robust way【10†L58-L63】 – moving closer to AI that *really* has “common sense” and not just the appearance of it.

**Sources:** The examples and datasets above are drawn from academic papers and talks by AI researchers, including Marcus & Davis’s analysis of GPT-3’s commonsense failures【16†L1-L9】【17†L13-L20】, Yejin Choi’s TED talk and writings on commonsense intelligence【3†L59-L67】【10†L58-L63】, the original Winograd Schema Challenge publication【35†L1681-L1689】, the AI2 Reasoning Challenge and associated benchmark descriptions【22†L1009-L1017】【26†L428-L436】, and other scholarly surveys of commonsense reasoning in AI【21†L23-L31】. Each category of failure – linguistic, physical, social – is actively studied, and benchmarks like those listed in category 4 serve as standardized tests to quantify progress (or highlight persistent gaps) in commonsense understanding for state-of-the-art AI systems.

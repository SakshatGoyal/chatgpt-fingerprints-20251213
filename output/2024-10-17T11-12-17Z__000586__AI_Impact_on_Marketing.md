Transcript:
(00:00) uh with that it's my delight to introduce the next  panel it's about Ai and marketing uh we have two   incredible people having a conversation together  uh Sir Martin Sorrell uh who is on our Advisory   Council uh and has redefined marketing over and  over again uh and is now the executive chairman   of S4 capital is with us and Professor um Israeli  who uh runs our consumer intelligence lab and is   doing some incredible research about the impact  of AI on marketing please welcome him thank you
(00:36) hi everyone uh thank you so much for being  here uh it's my absolute pleasure to have   this conversation with Sir Martin said that  before we begin yeah it's always like that   with you I know uh but I wanted to emphasize  maybe uh other people reflected the same way   but throughout every single session everyone has  been talking about marketing if it's advertising   if it's um creating copies if it's product  design all of these things are christening   e Ethan to lethan if you get my drift exactly  um yeah it is yeah I think it's probably it's
(01:18) probably the vertical one of the verticals  that's been most affected uh as early in   in the disruptive process right like to hear  from you as someone who is actually you know   on the ground in the field how do you see this  actually affecting you know Ethan fired his   marketing agency but but how do other how do  you see this yeah okay so um this comes with   a sort of a bit of a health warning given what  we've already heard um in Nvidia yeah we we're   sort of quite close to Nvidia obviously in terms  of what they're doing and building the capacity
(01:57) and it it really reminds me of Field of Dreams I  me remember Kevin Gosner says build it and they   will come and I think everything that you you're  hearing about today is in the context of massive   capacity being built out obviously there are  doubts from a compute power and energy point   of view as to whether there will be sufficient  capacity but it is very much build it and they   will they will come so uh the marketing area has  really been affected and everything I say is in   the context of that and I'll go through  five things that we see already happening
(02:31) probably uh in in descending order of traction at  the moment and what we're seeing with clients and   you know we work mainly with tech clients but we  work with package Goods clients healthcare clients   Etc we we're seeing um what I would describe as  um a certain degree of hesitation and if you talk   to the uh chip manufacturers or Nvidia for example  one of the things that they're very focused on is   the in 2024 is the development of use cases we've  heard of some use cases Ethan and others talked
(03:05) about the last session Healthcare obviously heard  about it too but I I would describe it as very   much a testing phase at the minute we we're  seeing a lot of clients do workshops audits   they're tinkering it was interesting to hear what  what somebody said in relation to Accenture and I   think the CTO Accenture if you look at it in the  context of Accenture revenues the the amount of   um Billings and revenues they're generated is  still small in the context of a 50 60 billion   uh dollar Consulting business so the first area  is what has been touched on already what I would
(03:47) call visualization and copyrighting so what took  us two or three weeks we can literally do in hours   uh and because we're in a in an industry that  wrongly sells time or sells hours rather than   sells outputs and we are switching to selling  outputs that's a two-edged sword because the   client particularly the procurement departments  will say to us we'll have a piece of that it's   costing you less it's taking you less time it's  costing it's costing less it should cost us less
(04:19) so that's but we are seeing that and and I suppose  you know the sort of developments you've seen with   Sora um and litx an Israeli startup which is  doing Sim SAR text to video um developments   tells you a little bit about what is happening in  terms of writing ads visualizing ads whether it be   Stills or or or video so that's one area where  we've seen significant impact the second area   which is related to that and this this I think is  really important and we're starting to see very
(04:53) significant traction uh at both a strategic level  I'll get into this in a second and tactical level   is in what we call personalization at scale now  this has been around for a long period of time   it's what I call the Netflix model Netflix is  still the company that you know I think a lot   of people should from a marketing point of view  should study because uh in an era where first   party data is of critical importance and know  there is a there could have been a Y2K moment   at the end of this year Google has postponed  deprecation of third party cookies for the
(05:30) for I think the third time it'll come in but  maybe six months or 12 months later the the   essential thing that our clients have to do  is to is to integrate their data their first   party data gets over the the privacy issues the  consent consumer consent issues and have that in   an ordered form most companies have haven't  done that they've had different CTO and cios   who done different systems they've grown through  acquisition they don't have integrated integrated   platforms well what Netflix did or does is is  produce personalized Communications based on
(06:05) Data Insights from two sources one is first party  data and the second is signals from the platforms   and they know that Israeli likes football or you  know Marcelo likes football and wants to see stuff   about Jon or whatever it is and they'll fashion  you know a rebel Moon uh piece of content or a   narcos piece of content around football or sport  know that you interested in business You On The   Wall Street Journal s fash it around business and  it's a personalized communication now before the
(06:38) ai's been around since 2014 you've been working  with Google since then on development of AI so   it's nothing new in a sense but for for Netflix  we might produce one and a half in theory one   and a half million different executions for an  Arcos or R Moon Camp campaign today with AI we   can probably do multiples of that so you've seen  a huge profusion of personalized communication   and what we're seeing now and this is happening in  real time and we are seeing some very significant
(07:11) global companies start to look at that is to have  two-tier sort of creative development you got s   strategic upper funnel creative development  and then the Practical implementation they're   building content factors so uh and and of  course established company companies this is   interesting there's been some discussion about  whether incumbents are under threat for May I   not I was at the Goldman Sachs um technological  disruptors conference and interesting a number   of the speakers said the incumbents are at an  advantage because they have two two advantages
(07:47) one is data and two is distribution and a lot  of the incumbents have the data and they have   the distribution and they have the content and for  example agencies will have Library of clients will   have libraries of content where they can stack  rank creative Effectiveness by by looking at   the data and deploy it so what you're starting to  see is strategic creative upper funnel stuff big   ideas that being deployed into content factories  that are being built content studios are building   at scale for example starting in the US and then  spun out globally that is very big and that in the
(08:26) first and second quarters of this year is getting  a lot of traction there's a lot of activity around   that so that's the second area the third area is  media planning and buying not much talked about   it because the six holding companies who probably  employ about 250,000 people in media planning and   buying really don't want to go there um and it's  just worth backing up minute and explaining that   the media industry it's about last year was  about $950 billion industry about 300 billion
(08:57) was in linear Network te TV radio Etc magazines  old old magazines and newspapers and 650 was in   digital and again the numbers are really important  to understand Google did about 225 billion of that   metha did despite you know the pressure they were  under a year or so ago two years ago 125 billion   and Amazon did about 50 probably trending towards  100 billion so you're talking about 350 billion   out of the 650 the digital out of the 950 the  total it'll be a trillion this year was in the
(09:35) hands of the three big Western platforms and then  I'm not forgetting about Alibaba 10 cent and Tick   Tock or bite dance bite dance is the only one  that's really broken through again remind you   of the numbers uh by dance this year I think  we'll probably do about 120 billion including   China Tik Tock having done 90 last year this is  AD revenues and Tik Tok this year probably will   do about 35 billion uh including the us having  done 20 the year before and 10 the year before   that so Tik tok's the only on that's really broken  through snap's about 6 and a half Twitter was five
(10:08) before Elon got his hands on it probably now doing  about two and a half and the Pinterest is around   four so Walmart 3 billion through retail so I'm  just giving you the the the rough size now that   industry is ripe for disruption the traditional  old Coes as I said have about 250,000 people   working on planning and buying you know my old  company wpp probably has about 45,000 out of   100,000 employees on on media in three networks  about 10 to 15,000 people in each Network you're   not going to need 25y old media planners or buyers  in the future Bots will do it and in the digital
(10:49) space extremely effectively I expect massive  disruption of media planning and buying uh over   the next 3 years let's say the the other thing  that's going to happen which is related to what   Ethan said is the platforms are going to get much  closer to the clients there was a I think it was   an apocryphal story a few years ago that one of  our major clients spoke directly I went see which   platform spoke directly to the sales director  one of the the platforms and said um invited him   to Detroit Al so you might guess who might might  well have been and said um said to him why don't
(11:29) we have a direct relationship and he said well  no you know I think to this day alphabet employs   about 180,000 people the biggest holding company  is employ 133,000 and think about the relative   sizes so so Google alphabet is a capital intensive  business and the head of sales said there's no   point because I just have to recreate recreate the  same number of people with AI that is not going   to be the case now so what you're going to see is  clients work much more closely with the platforms
(12:00) and there are three areas I think that are really  relevant in terms of client abilities and indeed   agency abilities in the future the first is  agility because that's going to be the the   premium quality that's required on both sides the  second is taking back control this gets back to   what Ethan said the simple fact is that the old  agency model of Outsourcing is not sufficient   anymore we have three models at S4 uh the first  is an embedded model where we put people into   the client the second is the classic Outsource  and the SEC third is the in-house with uh with
(12:37) Sprint uh and with T-Mobile it's a subject of a  har business case study we in house media uh at   Sprint and then later at T-Mobile specifically for  that reason so that area is absolutely huge the   fourth area is General efficiency and um you're  going to see you've heard it already today on the   client side the agent side and let me just give  you one specific example we have um an exclusive   arrangement with Nvidia in outside broadcasting  so if we want to if a linear broadcaster wants
(13:12) to um to transmit to out OB outside broadcast  a football match Jona versus Rael or Barcelona   whever ABS to be You' need a truck that truck will  cost the company probably about N9 or1 million uh   you could you could lease it cost you even more on  a on a capitalized basis but if you capitalized it   you bought it you'd have to write it off say over  five years one a half million a year an AI driven   Cloud solution costs1 to $200,000 so you're  talking about an 80 to 90% cost reduction for
(13:48) linear broadcasters at a time where they're under  heavy pressure so it's a good example of the sort   of efficiencies the thing that's the fourth area  the fifth and final area is what I think is the   most exciting and that is what I call somewhat  maybe pretentiously the democratization of   knowledge um organizations tend to be siloed I'm  sure that's not the case of anybody in this room   I'm sure that if any of you your colleagues ring  you up or email you or text you or even on the
(14:21) slack Channel say you know help me on this they  instantly drop what they're doing to help them   outside this this room outside this Hall that is  not the case so breaking down the efficiency and   Nvidia is really an interesting example um their  technology enables them to run a much more flatter   organization and an organization with much wider  control spans you know the classic would be what   is it McKenzie might recommend 12 or 13 people as  your direct reports you know nid is being run for
(14:56) example with much much wider you know 4 40 or 50  direct reports very little onetoone meetings and   an emphasis on goals and achieving goals you know  I I'm told that Jensen sets you know four or five   goals for people for his direct reports and it's  almost progress chasing for implementation so what   AI is doing is really eliminating bureaucracy  and in my experience you know the the killer in   in organizations is politics with a small small p  and the silos and the territories and what we may
(15:34) be starting to see I think is AI start to drive  knowledge because the resistance to sharing is   not at the lower levels in organizations it's at  the higher levels you know information is power   and it's blocked you know I think the biggest  things that we see in clients and agenes the   biggest blockers of the political issues so I  think I think that is probably the most powerful   so so let me uh latch on to that word of  democra democratizing knowledge so that   sounds very exciting uh and democratizing uh the  ability to to also do creative is something that
(16:10) is happening and it also sound exciting but it  also sounds very scary why do we need marketing   agencies or any type of agencies in this era if I  can just launch a bot to do all of it for me well   you need validators I mean take the media media  side of it for a minute um it may well be I mean   we started S4 sort of 5 years six years ago in our  media planning and buying operation dig we purely   digital so we're doing digital content we're doing  data and digital media and digital transformation
(16:42) or marketing transformation the relationship  always been very close with the platforms as a   validator you know you wouldn't give your Media  budget to rert Murdoch no no no criticism of   rupit intended but you would you would always  want a validator to make sure that independ   valid make sure that happen so there'll always  be that role I don't think any client is going   to automatically assume that the result is eth can  probably develop a validator b in 30 minutes while   while we're talking right and to be fair you're  already you're already seeing it in the small and
(17:18) mediumsized segments right because Google has pmax  um meta has Advantage Plus and in the small and   medium you know if I'm a small business owner  I can do exactly what Ethan showed you know I   can use uh creative and media planning and buying  tools to implement a program when you're getting   to scale it gets a bit more difficult and I think  it's much more complicated so I think there will   always be that role at the Enterprise level  but I don't think there's any doubt that those
(17:48) relationships you know the end I mentioned Google  pmax and Advantage Plus at meta those programs are   designed for small and mediumsized businesses I  think it's only a matter of time be before they   expand into the Enterprise segment but there's a  coalition there between platform client and agency   that I think works at that that scale and that  complexity uh let me uh bring back the word that   Mary brought up Joy so I think no marketer had Joy  from media buying right but the joy was maybe Mary
(18:25) has the wrong agency I mean the the creative we  we can provide Joy but but where where will the   marketers of the future have joy it's it's not  going to be from validating you called it that   doesn't sound like a but it it's from getting the  mo getting the most productive result I mean the   the joy will come from winning and succeeding and  being even more effective I mean I I mentioned   the these personalization platforms I mean these  this is a huge opportunity um you know you see it
(19:04) particularly in the streaming segment I mean the  competition there um and it is quite remarkable   that you know Netflix have been doing this for  a number of years and it's it's interesting when   when you present their model to even the most  sophisticated technology companies uh their   eyes widen and there there is some joy that comes  through as a as as a result of that um so I think   that's where it comes from or that's that where  it will come from and the these opportunities are
(19:36) absolutely huge in terms you know for example in  Europe with an automotive manufacturer who've been   doing this across 27 countries you know the old  model you know in each country uh every country   head would say you the French car buyer for  example or the German car buyer or the Italian   or the Spanish or the British is different yeah  I need a green sky with a red car and polka dot   tires or whatever it happens to be the and you  couldn't do that other by doing it separately   today you can you can provide distinct and  personalized communication at huge scale almost
(20:20) instantaneously this is a very different system  uh the biggest blocker is often the organizational   block MH because this companies are organized  Often by country they often have a country CEO and   a country CMO and that organizational structure  May well be a block to centralization for example   in not just in the marketing area but other area  so a lot of this has to do with organizational   change and the reason why companies I think are  slow to adopt is there are inbuilt resistances   and frictions that prevent organizational  restrictions that prevent them from happening
(21:03) so as we look toward uh kind of the next the agent  the multi-agent based uh GPT and Bots and all of   that it what what is the you know right size of a  marketing agency in the well it it's interesting   inidia I think it finds it easier to deal with  organizations that are sort of 8 to 10,000 or 10   to 12,000 rather than 100,000 MH and and I I think  there will be great I said agility was key yep uh   and I think agility is a core competence that has  to be developed and scale and size I mean Mary for
(21:42) example said she put a headcount restriction  in in after the the debed advisory meeting um   that sort of response I think you're going to see  increasingly I think people are sort of stalling   on organizational expansion as they see what  the implications of these changes are for   their organizations the I think the answer to your  question is from a headcount point of view smaller   I mean my view and I don't think it's come up so  far in the sessions you know is AI a net generator
(22:17) of employment or reducer my view is it's a net  reducer you know that what Kane's wrote about   almost 100 years ago he was right about in terms  of automation ending up giving us more holidays   but it was 100 years too early and and I think  I think that's the net result of it I mean if I   look at our industry and if I go through those  five things for a minute on visualization and   copyrighting less employment on personalization  at scale the unit price might come down but the   number of assets that we will be employ deploying  will increase so that the the multiple will be
(22:55) greater more employment in the third area media  planning and Less in the fourth area efficiency   there'll be some gains some things democratization  of knowledge maybe there'll be more opportunity   because people will be hugely empowered by what's  happening in the organization and I think there'll   be a more opportuni a result um we have about  two more minutes so I want you I want to try to   end on a positive note uh of I been negative all  of the uh you know my creative people out there
(23:27) David ugly da Draper Peggy that are freaking out  uh from what is happening I don't think they're   fre no I think that's no I don't think they're  well I mean journalists may be freaking out um   I don't think that's true actually I think there  are a lot of people you know just for example take   that second area high level creative you know  upper funnel creative huge opportunities there   and the big idea is still as relevant as it was  in David OG's time um as as it will be I think
(24:00) today it's going to be different though but but  GPT can give me those ideas right well I can ask   GPT to be Draper there there's for every person  who says I'll take it from gbt there are others   who say they're not prepared to do that right that  the the human mind might be be capable at least in   the near future of producing better ideas so  there's a there's a balance there so I think   there are significant opportunities so you heard  it here first the human mind at least in the near
(24:35) future is still better than AI that's what we  heard right that's right thank you very much

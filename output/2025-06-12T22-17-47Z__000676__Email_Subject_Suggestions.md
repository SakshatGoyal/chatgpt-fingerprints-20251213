Here are a few subject line options, depending on the tone and clarity you want:

**Professional and Direct:**  
- **Follow-Up: Additional Content to Review Together**  
- **Request to Sync on Unshared Materials**  
- **Next Steps: Reviewing Outstanding Content**

**More Collaborative Tone:**  
- **Quick Sync Next Week on Remaining Content?**  
- **Let’s Review What Was Missed**

**If it's tied to a project or presentation:**  
- **[Project Name] – Additional Materials for Review**  
- **Catching Up on What We Didn’t Share**

Would you like it to reflect urgency, a specific project, or keep it general?

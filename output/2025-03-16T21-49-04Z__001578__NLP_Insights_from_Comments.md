# NLP Insights from Comments

## You (2025-03-16T21:49:04.881000+00:00)

Hey Andrew, help me build a prompt. My objective is for ChatGPT to help me create a data science project so basically I have this really thick spreadsheet. The spreadsheet consists of users usernames, and some of the comments they have left behind across different areas of the website, so what I need is some kind of approach that could help me minimize the amount of manual work involved in drawing out insights from this spreadsheet, the spreadsheet is very long. There are far too many comments for me to read through manually.

I'm thinking of initiating some kind of data science project that could use complex NLP algorithms and essentially work like another ChatGPT but at the same time I don't want to do any of this on my laptop. I was hoping to do all of this through some kind of external tool so that I don't need to install any dependencies or plug-ins or what not into my system.

Great starting point! Before crafting the prompt, let's clarify a few points together to ensure the resulting prompt is precisely tailored to your goals and expectations:

**Clarifying Questions:**

1. **Data and Objective:**
   - Could you briefly describe what specific insights or patterns you're interested in extracting from these user comments? For example, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, spam detection, or perhaps identifying user trends?

2. **Complexity & Depth:**
   - How deep or granular do you need these insights to be? Should the analysis summarize broad themes, highlight notable individual comments, or categorize users/comments into groups?

3. **Preferred External Tools:**
   - Are you open to using cloud-based services like Google Colab, Kaggle Kernels, AWS SageMaker, or Azure ML, or do you have another specific external tool/platform in mind?

4. **Technical Limitations & Constraints:**
   - Are there any specific limitations or assumptions regarding data privacy, security, or compliance you want to include in your project setup?

5. **Output Format:**
   - What form do you envision the output to take (e.g., visual dashboards, interactive summaries, automated reports, JSON data)?

6. **Example or Reference:**
   - If possible, could you provide a brief example or describe an ideal scenario of how you'd envision the final insights presented?

Once you've clarified these points, I'll construct a structured and optimized prompt aligned closely to your specific scenario.

# Thickening gatte ki sabzi

## You (2025-09-12T04:15:01.200000+00:00)

i was making gatte ki sabzi and in the batter for the gatte, i accidently added too much water. I don't have any more chickpe flour, so do u have any thoughts on how i could thicken it without impacting the end flavor?

Got it — classic gatte ki sabzi issue 🙂. Since you don’t have more besan (chickpea flour), you’ll need to use something neutral to tighten the dough without changing the flavor much. A few workable options:

**1. Whole wheat flour (atta)**
- Small amounts (a tablespoon at a time) can firm up the batter.
- It won’t change the taste much once the gatte are boiled and added to curry.

**2. Rice flour or cornstarch (if available)**
- Both are bland and will soak up excess water.
- Rice flour keeps it closer to the original texture, while cornstarch can make it slightly smoother.

**3. Semolina (sooji/rava)**
- Just a little bit will absorb liquid and give body.
- It adds a faint nutty bite, but in the curry it blends right in.

**4. Crushed dry breadcrumbs** (as a last resort)
- Neutral and absorbent, but only use sparingly so the taste doesn’t stand out.

👉 Best pick if you want to keep it close to authentic: **rice flour first, then wheat flour** if rice flour isn’t handy.

Do you want me to suggest the exact proportions for fixing it (like tablespoon ratios), depending on how runny your batter is?

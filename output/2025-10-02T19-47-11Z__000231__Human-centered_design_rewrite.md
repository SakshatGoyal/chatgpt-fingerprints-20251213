# Human-centered design rewrite

## You (2025-10-02T19:47:11.229000+00:00)

Imagine yourself as a design lead at IDEO communicating to a boardroom of a client's product and engineering leaders. You were able to create a set of design principles and some examples of how they can be applied in practice in the attached document. 

Recreate the exact document, but this time use a tone and language that matches your human-centered style, communicating with the audience directly.

Visible boundaries help them build a correct mental model—which is what sustains long-term use.\\n\\n### Implementation Guidelines\\n- Always *surface the scope* of what was searched or considered.\\n- Where useful, show **confidence ranges** or **coverage maps**.\\n- Add short, scannable “What I know about this” summaries.\\n- Default to **showing sources**, even for partial answers.\\n\\n**Edge Case:**\\nAvoid technical dump-outs (e.g., missing APIs). Map the **functional edge**, not the plumbing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. **Always Leave With Value**\\n\\n> “People forgive a partial; they don’t forgive a dead end.”\\n\\nEven with gaps, **never return empty-handed**. Offer a partial answer, a starting insight, or a next-best step. Momentum is the value.\\n\\n### Implementation Guidelines\\n- Frame partials clearly: “Here’s what I can tell you right now.”\\n- Provide **fallbacks** (related knowledge, common workflows, adjacent experts).\\n- If blocked, offer a **plan**: “I can’t get X yet—here’s what I *do* have.”\\n\\n**Edge Case:**\\nDon’t dress up guesses as value. If it’s uncertain, label it as such and keep it useful.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. **Narrate the Arc, Not the Apology**\\n\\n> “Talk about progress, not deficiency.”\\n\\nPeople buy the **trajectory**, not just the tool. Frame limitations as **current milestones** in a clear growth path. That’s how belief compounds.\\n\\n### Implementation Guidelines\\n- Use light metaphors where it helps: “apprentice,” “growing brain,” “second nervous system.”\\n- Surface crisp growth notes: “Last week I learned X.”\\n- Place trajectory in **opt-in moments** (onboarding, milestones, summaries).\\n- Preview what’s coming **sparingly** and only when relevant.\\n\\n**Edge Case:**\\nDon’t push roadmaps mid-task. Save aspiration for when attention is available.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. **Pull the User Into the Loop**\\n\\n> “Invite people to shape it; celebrate their impact.”\\n\\nLet users see that their input **trains or expands** the system. Co-creation increases tolerance and engagement.\\n\\n### Implementation Guidelines\\n- Let people flag blind spots or propose connections.\\n- Offer subscriptions to improvements on topics they care about.\\n- Acknowledge contributions: “Thanks to your query, I added new context.”\\n\\n**Edge Case:**\\nDon’t make users your mechanical Turk. Collaboration should **reduce** friction, not add it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. **Sustain Flow, Not Just Trust**\\n\\n> “Trust keeps belief; flow keeps attention.”\\n\\nExplanations should never stall the work. Keep people in motion with information, next steps, or a subtle prompt to continue.\\n\\n### Implementation Guidelines\\n- Default to **action over exposition**.\\n- Close with a gentle hook:\\n  - “Want to go deeper?”\\n  - “Should I flag this for follow-up?”\\n  - “Want me to track changes here?”\\n\\n**Edge Case:**\\nIn high-stakes contexts (finance, legal, exec decisions), pause for clarity—then return to motion immediately after.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 🔷 Part 2: Applying the Principles – A Guide for Product, Design, and Engineering\\n\\nTreat these as **navigation tools**, not rigid rules. Use them to steer through ambiguity, frustration, and narrative fatigue.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🜂 1. **Show the Edges of Knowledge** → *Design for Predictability, Not Perfection*\\n\\n### What this means for you\\n- Help users form an accurate mental model of what’s known **today**.\\n- Make scope **visible** with maps, source tags, and filters.\\n- Anchor every answer inside its **knowledge perimeter**.\\n\\n### Example\\n> **Prompt:** “How are Q2 budgets looking for Team B?”\\n>\\n> **System:** *“I can see finalized budgets in Workday, not real-time expenses. Based on that, Team B is at 72% utilization. Want me to alert you when live expense data lands?”*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🜁 2. **Always Leave With Value** → *Never Abandon the User Empty-Handed*\\n\\n### What this means for you\\n- Replace “I don’t know” with “Here’s what I do know.”\\n- Optimize for **relevance over completeness**.\\n- Suggest adjacent actions or nearby answers.\\n\\n### Example\\n> **Prompt:** “What’s the outcome of the last vendor negotiation?”\\n>\\n> **System:** *“I don’t have the meeting transcript yet, but I found the updated contract and dates. Want a quick summary of what changed?”*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🜃 3. **Narrate the Arc, Not the Apology** → *Make Incompleteness a Chapter, Not a Crisis*\\n\\n### What this means for you\\n- Drop defensive language. Show **progress**.\\n- Use a human voice—brief, confident, intentional.\\n- Keep forward-looking statements short and grounded.\\n\\n### Example\\n> *“Slack threads aren’t included yet—that’s next on my list. For now, here’s what I can infer from Jira + Salesforce.”*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🜄 4. **Pull the User Into the Loop** → *Invite Collaboration, Not Just Consumption*\\n\\n### What this means for you\\n- Let users shape evolution without burden.\\n- Give visible credit (“Thanks to your input…”).\\n- Make feedback loops part of the **core flow**, not a footnote.\\n\\n### Example\\n> After a miss: *“I couldn’t answer this today. Want me to prioritize learning this area? I’ll notify you when I can.”*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🜛 5. **Sustain Flow, Not Just Trust** → *Keep the Conversation in Motion*\\n\\n### What this means for you\\n- Minimize exposition unless it’s requested or critical.\\n- Add soft next steps to every output.\\n- Avoid heavy transitions; keep momentum.\\n\\n### Example\\n> *“Here’s the current project timeline. Want to see dependencies next?”*\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 🧭 Final Thought: Strategy Over Sympathy\\n\\nEmpathy without a backbone turns into apology theater. Credibility comes from **predictability**, **coherent narrative**, and **useful motion**.\\n\\n**The Credibility Loop** helps you:\\n- Show humility without losing strength,\\n- Show incompleteness without losing trust,\\n- Show forward motion without detours.\\n\\nIf helpful, I can translate these into UX copy patterns, design prompts, or a product review checklist next.\"}"}

I’ve recreated the document in a direct, human-centered voice tailored to a boardroom of product and engineering leaders. You’ll find it on the canvas titled “Credibility Principles — Boardroom Edition (Human-Centered Rewrite).” fileciteturn0file0

If you want, I can also spin this into a one-page executive handout or a set of review checklists for product milestones.

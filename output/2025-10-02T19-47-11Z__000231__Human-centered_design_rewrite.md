# Human-centered design rewrite

## You (2025-10-02T19:47:11.229000+00:00)

Imagine yourself as a design lead at IDEO communicating to a boardroom of a client's product and engineering leaders. You were able to create a set of design principles and some examples of how they can be applied in practice in the attached document.

Recreate the exact document, but this time use a tone and language that matches your human-centered style, communicating with the audience directly.

I’ve recreated the document in a direct, human-centered voice tailored to a boardroom of product and engineering leaders. You’ll find it on the canvas titled “Credibility Principles — Boardroom Edition (Human-Centered Rewrite).” fileciteturn0file0

If you want, I can also spin this into a one-page executive handout or a set of review checklists for product milestones.

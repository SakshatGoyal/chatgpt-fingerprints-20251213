# Content Delivery for PMs

## You (2025-04-28T19:01:33.793583+00:00)

Hey, I have a lot of this content. It's almost like 16 people problems along with their potential solutions. So if you were a PM, how would you like to actually receive all this content? Because it's too much to digest for any one person. And it's too much for me also to just type up everything into slide decks.

Got it — you're dealing with **a very rich, very dense** set of people problems and potential solutions. From a **Julie Zhuo strategic lens**, I'd think about your situation like this:

First, the meta-problem isn't "How do I dump all this content?" It's **how do I help real PMs access and apply it without overwhelm?**

We can use her **Purpose–People–Process** filter:

- **Purpose** → What outcome are we optimizing for? (Is it better decision-making? Faster onboarding? Pattern recognition?)
- **People** → Who's the user? (Senior PMs? New managers? Strategy teams?)
- **Process** → How do they naturally consume and apply insights today?

**If I were a PM on the receiving end, I would want it delivered in one of these ways:**

| Format | Why it Works | How it Might Look |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Referenceable Guide (Interactive, Searchable)** | Not all problems are relevant now. I want to pull what I need when the situation arises. | A Notion wiki, Coda doc, or searchable site structured by "symptom" or "situation." |
| **Short Series (Bite-Sized Drops)** | I can’t process 16 complex cases at once. If you drip it to me 1–2 at a time, it sticks. | Weekly “People Problem of the Week” emails or Slack drops. |
| **Pattern Playbook (Clustered Themes)** | I think better in patterns, not one-off cases. If you group them into themes, I can learn strategic thinking, not just memorize examples. | Bundle them into 4–5 themes (e.g., "When Speed vs. Resilience Collide," "Governance vs. Growth") with a quick framing upfront. |
| **Interactive Workshop or Decision Tree** | Applying it is different than reading it. Give me light activities to practice judgment. | A 1-hour working session where PMs try to diagnose 2–3 fictional problems using your content. |
| **Slackbot Helper** | When I'm in a real situation, I need a fast hint, not a manual. | A simple internal bot: "Feeling stuck? DM /people-problem and describe the situation." The bot matches to the closest framework. |

**Some coaching questions for you before choosing a delivery model:**

1. **What matters more to you right now: distribution (getting it out) or adoption (getting it used)?**
2. **If PMs remembered *only one thing* after engaging with your content, what would it be?**
3. **Are you imagining a one-time drop or an ongoing resource?**
4. **Do you want it to feel like a ‘serious handbook’ or a ‘useful sidekick’?**

---

**My strong suggestion:**
**Prioritize one small, scalable format first.**
Don't try to polish everything into decks immediately — instead, ship a Minimum Viable Playbook.

If you want, I can help you mock up one or two options (like a "People Problem Pattern Map" or a "Notion structure") based on what you're leaning toward.

Okay, good. This has given me a few things to think about. As far as purpose is concerned, I was basically... Think of this more as supplemental content. The primary content is just 16 sentences put into a table. And then we are just basically highlighting different parts of the table at different points of time. And the table itself will not have... Each cell will not have a full sentence. It will just have a friction, like short-term efficiencies versus long-term goals. So that will be... That one cell, one statement will be representative of an entire people problem statement. But at the same time, there has to be some place within the slide deck where all of this content is referenced. It is... As far as people is concerned, it is for the product leaders. And how do they naturally consume insights today, I'm not entirely sure.

So I was basically commissioned to do this kind of literature study and identify potential areas for exploration like a potential market product fit and I think those summary tables will do a lot of that but I also need some place to reference all of this content so they can basically go back to and figure out like okay this is what I need.

What matters more to me right now? I do want to get it out as soon as I can. But I also want to make sure the content is somewhat consumed. If PNs remember only one thing, it should be... I don't know, you tell me what should PNs remember. This will be a one-time drop. This should feel like a serious handbook.

You’re thinking about this really clearly — you’ve scoped your Purpose–People–Process better than most would in an ambiguous situation. Let’s walk through your framing carefully:

---

### What I hear you saying:
- **Primary Surface Area:** The *summary table* → super tight, friction-focused, a few words per cell (✅ good for scanning).
- **Deeper Reference:** A *backlink to richer content* → somewhere people can dig deeper if they want.
- **Audience:** *Product leaders* — serious thinkers, accustomed to models and synthesis.
- **Primary Goal:** Ship it **soon**, but **still be credible and durable**.
- **Tone:** This should feel like a **serious handbook**, not a casual blog post.

---

### Based on that, here's my recommendation:

**Deliverable Design:**
- **Slide Deck Primary Layer:**
  - Table of 16 people problems → short phrasing only.
  - Highlight different frictions over time → maybe shaded rows / cycles.
  - Each table entry hyperlinked (or footnoted) to the deeper content.

- **Supplementary Layer (Reference Guide):**
  - Single document (PDF or Notion/Doc site) titled something like
    🛠️ **"People Frictions Reference Guide — Version 1.0"**
  - Organized cleanly:
    - 1-page intro: *“Why these frictions matter.”*
    - 1-page on *how to use the table and when to dive deeper.*
    - Each friction has 1–2 pages max: full description + how you know it's a problem + what success would look like (the content you already wrote).

### Quick Template Idea for the Reference Guide:

```markdown
# People Frictions Reference Guide — v1.0

## Introduction
- Why "people problems" are early indicators of systemic risk
- How product leaders can use this guide

## Quick Table of Contents
1. Short-term Efficiency vs Long-term Resilience → [Jump to Details]
2. Outsourcing Gains vs Internal Capability Loss → [Jump to Details]
...
16. [Last Friction Name] → [Jump to Details]

## Friction #1: Short-term Efficiency vs Long-term Resilience

**What ‘people problem’ are we trying to solve?**
(Your full statement)

**How do we know this is a problem?**
(Examples)

**How might we know if we’ve solved this?**
(Behavioral success markers)

---

(repeat for each friction)
```

And if you want to future-proof it even slightly:
🔖 Add a date and version (so it feels like a living artifact, even if you don't update it).

---

### What should PMs remember?

You asked me: *"I don't know, you tell me."*
Here's what *I* would want PMs to remember after touching this:

> **"Every persistent friction among people is a signal of future strategic drag or risk. Smart leaders catch it early, name it, and design around it — before it becomes expensive."**

Because this isn’t *just* literature.
It’s a **tool for pattern recognition** before problems metastasize.

---

### Summary of Action Plan for You:
- **Primary:** 1 slide deck with a tight summary table (lightweight cells, maybe 1 row highlight per week if you need drip content).
- **Secondary:** 1 clean, serious Reference Guide (PDF or clean Notion page).
- **Memory Goal for PMs:** Early friction = early design opportunity.

Would you like me to sketch what a few slides could look like too, just so you can visualize? 🎨
(It’ll only take a few minutes.)
Would you prefer a "minimal serious" deck design or a "slightly dynamic" one with a few visual cues for friction categories?

# Design Deck Strategy

## You (2025-04-21T11:03:35.499810+00:00)

Hey, I need your experience sharing design insights with different executive stakeholders to guide me through the ideal content structure and flow of a presentation. I'm attaching three documents here. The first one is archetypes.md. This one is basically, as the document suggests, talks about individual archetypes that we have formed. The next one is the peopleproblemstatements.md. This one actually talks about the people problem issues per archetype. And the last one is design principles. As the content suggests, these are some design principles we are exploring while designing for AI. So we have all this content, but I want to know what the ideal approach might be while structuring the slide decks, because it is going to end up having a lot of slides. So if you have any ideas or suggestions on how I could optimize it for different CEOs, chief C-level executives, and other VPs within the company, that would be helpful.

Great — this is rich, thoughtful content. You're already sitting on a goldmine of insight, so the key now is **how to elevate signal above noise** in a way that’s executive-attuned. Let’s walk through a strategic framing for your slide deck.

---

### 🎯 First, Let’s Anchor: What’s Your Goal?

When presenting to CEOs, C-suite execs, and VPs, your deck isn’t just to *share* design work — it’s to:

- **Frame strategic stakes** through the lens of human problems.
- **Show alignment between design thinking and business priorities.**
- **Build trust in the thoughtfulness, maturity, and strategic relevance of your work.**

Executives don’t want to “review your work” — they want to understand how your thinking helps the company win **with clarity, risk-awareness, and people-centered impact.**

---

### 🔁 Suggested Slide Flow: Executive-Aligned and People-Centered

Here’s a high-leverage structure to guide your presentation:

---

#### **1. Opening Slide: “What This Is Really About”**
- A single sentence framing the core of the opportunity/problem.
- E.g., *“We’re designing AI systems that amplify executive judgment — not replace it — across archetypes who face competing pressures of speed, trust, and identity.”*

---

#### **2. Executive Archetypes: Decision Behaviors, Not Personas**
- Introduce the 5 archetypes.
- One slide each (max) — summarize each with:
  - **Inner Narrative** (from your doc — these are brilliant!)
  - Their **default tension** or **blind spot**
  - A compelling **“why this matters now”** hook

👉 Optional framing: “What each archetype gets right — and what they often overlook.”

---

#### **3. People Problems: Strategic Stakes**
This is your most important section.

**Format: One slide per problem. Group by archetype.**
- State the people problem as a tension (you’ve done this beautifully).
- Show **why it matters** (1–2 bullets, or quotes/data if relevant).
- Then anchor the **“How we’ll know we’re solving it”** — evidence-based outcomes.

Tip: Use **iconography** or color coding to map problems back to the relevant archetype.

---

#### **4. Design Principles: Our North Stars**
Frame this section as your **strategic design response** to the problems.

- Start with a slide that says: *“If we want to solve these people problems well, what must we believe about good AI design?”*
- Then group your principles (3–5 grouped slides max), e.g.:
  - Human Judgment & Strategic Agency
  - Explainability & Trust
  - Ambiguity & Divergence
  - Adaptive Role-shifting
- Use side-by-side “Principle vs. Counter-Principle” visuals from your doc to show the trade-offs clearly.

End this section with:
- A **“so what” slide**: *“This is not just about usability. It’s about reinforcing ethical leadership, system trust, and decision clarity.”*

---

#### **5. Application Slide: Connecting Archetypes ↔ Problems ↔ Principles**
A synthesis slide — probably a heatmap/table or quadrant diagram that shows:
- How each archetype intersects with:
  - Specific people problems
  - Which principles are most critical to solve for them

This shows you’ve mapped **strategy → behavior → design.** Execs love this kind of systems thinking.

---

#### **6. Wrap-up Slide: What We Need Next**
- Highlight open questions, assumptions, or decision points.
- Offer clear next steps (e.g., pilots, testing stages, or senior input moments).
- Use this as an invitation for collaboration, not just a signoff.

---

### 🔁 Bonus: Alternate Pathways by Executive Role
If you have time (or get questions post-deck), consider having **appendix slides** tailored to:
- **CEO/COO** – strategic risk, sequencing, velocity
- **CFO** – clarity on trade-offs, efficiency vs. resilience
- **CPO/CHRO** – leadership quality, trust, symbolic signals
- **CIO/CTO** – system coherence, modernization, architecture

---

### 🧠 Final Thought: Frame with Coherence, Not Comprehensiveness
With content this rich, the risk is **oversaturation.** Focus on **depth over breadth**. Your goal is not to cover everything — it’s to:
- **Frame what matters**
- **Show your strategic maturity**
- **Create clarity around complex trade-offs**

Would you like a visual skeleton or starter slides for this flow? Happy to draft that out.

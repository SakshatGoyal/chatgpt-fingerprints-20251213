This is in particular for the Harvard Business School. They have a lot of these events based on AI. And so what I tried to do is interviewed about 12 people. And based on those interviews, I tried to sort of break down the entire event experience into four phases. The first phase being preparation. Now this is where a person may either mentally prepare themselves or physically complete certain tasks to prepare themselves for an event. This could be asking some questions to themselves about what they want to get out of the event. Or it could be, you know, some tasks like trying to find out who's attending the event, if their friends are tagging along, so on. The next phase is attendance. Now this is the actual act of attending the event. This is where the attendee is at the event. They're engaged with the content, they're networking with other attendees, and, you know, whatever tasks or activities that are happening at the event, this phase is where those activities take place.

In one case, it could be that the attendee got inspired by some of the talks and tries to take some next steps in terms of trying to learn more about the concepts discussed, explore them on their own. Or it could be that the attendees try to network or reach out to other people who were at the event. Or, worst case scenario, they forget that the event ever took place and they just move on with their lives. But that's why it's called divergence. Different people will go on to their different paths after the event. So, these are the four phases.

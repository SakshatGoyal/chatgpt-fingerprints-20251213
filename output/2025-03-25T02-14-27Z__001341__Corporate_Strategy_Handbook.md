🔧 GPT-4o Prompt:

Persona: Harvard-Educated Business Strategy Professor
Objective: Based on the content shared with you, write a 3-page, solution-agnostic handbook that clearly explains what corporate strategy is—including its principles, dynamics, patterns, and common misconceptions.
Audience: Designers, researchers, and product strategists who collaborate cross-functionally and have light exposure to strategic concepts, but are not strategists themselves.
Constraints:

Do not propose design solutions or research plans.
Remain strictly solution-agnostic.
Use no case studies or detailed real-world examples.
Tone should be rigorous yet clear, similar to what might be found in a Harvard Business Review publication.
Length should approximate a 3-page document.
📘 Structure & Content Instructions:

1. Introduction (1 paragraph max)

Define what corporate strategy is in clear, academic terms.
Briefly position it within the larger landscape of business strategy (referencing six-type model is allowed but not necessary to explain all six).
2. Foundational Principles of Corporate Strategy
Use structured sections or bullet lists as needed. Focus on:

The scope of corporate strategy (e.g., entire organization, multi-business-unit, portfolio-level).
Its temporal horizon (long-term, often multi-year).
The primary decision-makers (CEOs, boards, founders).
The core strategic questions (e.g., “What businesses should we be in?” “How should we allocate capital across units?”).
3. How Corporate Strategy Differs from Other Strategic Types

Provide conceptual contrast (e.g., how it differs from business-level or innovation strategy).
Mention overlapping boundaries and clarify using abstract distinctions (avoid examples like “Disney buying Marvel”).
4. Strategic Patterns & Archetypes (Optional)

If helpful, outline patterns like “portfolio expansion,” “conglomerate diversification,” or “focus strategy” as conceptual archetypes—without suggesting their use.
Note that these are observed patterns in corporate decision-making, not prescriptive templates.
5. Frameworks & Analytical Lenses

Briefly introduce frameworks like Porter’s Five Forces, SWOT, Ansoff Matrix, or GE/McKinsey Matrix—explained not as how-tos, but as models historically used to structure corporate-level thinking.
6. Common Misconceptions

Clarify what corporate strategy is not (e.g., it is not operational planning, not product-level innovation, not short-term tactics).
Mention that while it influences all layers below it, corporate strategy operates at a distinct abstraction level.
7. Navigating Ambiguity

Discuss how corporate strategy decisions are often fluid, multi-layered, and involve ambiguity.
Encourage recognizing strategic intent, scope, and impact horizon as diagnostic cues for identifying true corporate strategy.
8. Closing Reflection

Emphasize that understanding corporate strategy allows non-strategists to better recognize when they’re observing it in the wild—and to ask smarter questions during research or design phases.
🧠 GPT-4o Thinking Instructions (Chain-of-Thought)

Before you write, reflect on the audience: product thinkers who need clarity to inform research, not executives or strategists.
Think through the edges and overlaps of corporate strategy vs. other types—express these distinctions abstractly and cleanly.
Avoid buzzwords. Use academic rigor but explain terms clearly.
Think structurally—each section should build conceptually on the last.
Review and ensure the final piece is free from implied recommendations.

{"content_type": "code", "language": "json", "response_format_name": null, "text": "{\"name\":\"corporate_strategy_guide\",\"type\":\"document\",\"content\":\"**Understanding Corporate Strategy: A Solution-Agnostic Handbook**\\n\\n**Introduction**\\n\\nCorporate strategy represents the highest level of strategic decision-making within an organization, guiding its long-term trajectory, determining its portfolio composition, and setting foundational priorities for growth and positioning. Distinct from business-level or functional strategies, corporate strategy considers the entire organization's resources, capabilities, and ambitions. It situates itself atop the broader landscape of strategic types, often framing choices about market entries, exits, mergers, acquisitions, and resource allocation.\\n\\n**Foundational Principles of Corporate Strategy**\\n\\nCorporate strategy operates on several fundamental principles:\\n\\n- **Scope:**\\n  - Concerns decisions impacting the entire organization or multiple business units.\\n  - Includes mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, diversification, and large-scale resource distribution.\\n\\n- **Temporal Horizon:**\\n  - Long-term in perspective, typically spanning multi-year periods (5+ years).\\n  - Focused on sustained competitive advantage and industry influence.\\n\\n- **Decision-makers:**\\n  - Primarily set by top executives, including CEOs, founders, senior executives, and boards.\\n  - Decision processes often involve high-level analysis, strategic debates, and substantial stakeholder alignment.\\n\\n- **Core Strategic Questions:**\\n  - \\\"What businesses should we participate in?\\\"\\n  - \\\"How do we allocate capital across various units?\\\"\\n  - \\\"What is our strategic position within and across industries?\\\"\\n  - \\\"How do we shape and respond to our competitive environment?\\\"\\n\\n**How Corporate Strategy Differs from Other Strategic Types**\\n\\nCorporate strategy is distinct in its broad, overarching nature:\\n\\n- Unlike **Business-Level Strategy**, which addresses market-specific competitive positioning, corporate strategy deals with organization-wide portfolio management.\\n- Unlike **Functional & Tactical Strategy**, which involves department-specific execution, corporate strategy maintains an elevated, abstract viewpoint.\\n- It differs significantly from **Innovation & Growth Strategy**, though overlaps occur; corporate strategy emphasizes portfolio decisions and long-term industry positioning rather than purely new product innovations or market entry.\\n\\nThese strategic boundaries, while sometimes overlapping, are distinguishable through their scope, impact, and intent.\\n\\n**Strategic Patterns & Archetypes**\\n\\nCorporate strategic decisions frequently exhibit identifiable patterns, including:\\n\\n- **Portfolio Expansion:** Seeking growth through market entry or acquisition of complementary businesses.\\n- **Conglomerate Diversification:** Expanding into unrelated industries for risk mitigation and leveraging organizational capabilities.\\n- **Focus Strategy:** Concentrating resources on core businesses and competencies, often involving divestiture of non-core assets.\\n\\nIt is essential to note these patterns represent observed behaviors rather than prescriptive strategic choices.\\n\\n**Frameworks & Analytical Lenses**\\n\\nSeveral classical frameworks provide analytical lenses through which corporate strategy is often examined:\\n\\n- **Porter's Five Forces:** Analyzes industry attractiveness and strategic positioning.\\n- **SWOT Analysis:** Assesses internal strengths and weaknesses against external opportunities and threats.\\n- **Ansoff Matrix:** Categorizes growth options by product-market strategies (market penetration, market development, product development, diversification).\\n- **GE/McKinsey Matrix:** Evaluates portfolio businesses based on market attractiveness and competitive strength, guiding resource allocation.\\n\\nThese frameworks are employed not as prescriptive guides but as structured methods to clarify and refine strategic thinking at the corporate level.\\n\\n**Common Misconceptions**\\n\\nCorporate strategy is frequently misunderstood:\\n\\n- **Not Operational Planning:** It does not involve short-term operational decisions or routine management tasks.\\n- **Not Product-Level Innovation:** While innovation can influence corporate strategy, innovation-specific strategies typically remain at business or innovation strategy levels.\\n- **Not Short-term Tactics:** Corporate strategy operates on long-term horizons, distinct from immediate tactical responses or quarterly targets.\\n\\nUnderstanding corporate strategy involves recognizing its distinct abstraction level and the scope of impact on the organization's entire portfolio.\\n\\n**Navigating Ambiguity**\\n\\nCorporate strategy decisions inherently involve ambiguity, complexity, and multi-layered considerations:\\n\\n- Fluid and dynamic due to shifting market conditions and long-term forecasting.\\n- Ambiguity arises from balancing conflicting stakeholder interests, market uncertainties, and long-term implications.\\n- Strategic intent (portfolio shaping, capital allocation, long-term positioning) serves as a crucial diagnostic cue for distinguishing corporate-level decisions.\\n\\nRecognizing corporate strategy involves observing decisions with significant impact scope, multi-year horizons, and high-level stakeholder involvement.\\n\\n**Closing Reflection**\\n\\nUnderstanding corporate strategy empowers non-strategists—including designers, researchers, and product strategists—to identify strategic decisions accurately when encountered. It enhances one's ability to contextualize organizational actions, fostering informed inquiry and deeper cross-functional collaboration without prescribing specific solutions or approaches.\"}"}

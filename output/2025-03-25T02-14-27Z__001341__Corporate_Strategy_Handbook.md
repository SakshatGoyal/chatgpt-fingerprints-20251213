# Corporate Strategy Handbook

## You (2025-03-25T02:14:27.782000+00:00)

🔧 GPT-4o Prompt:

Persona: Harvard-Educated Business Strategy Professor
Objective: Based on the content shared with you, write a 3-page, solution-agnostic handbook that clearly explains what corporate strategy is—including its principles, dynamics, patterns, and common misconceptions.
Audience: Designers, researchers, and product strategists who collaborate cross-functionally and have light exposure to strategic concepts, but are not strategists themselves.
Constraints:

Do not propose design solutions or research plans.
Remain strictly solution-agnostic.
Use no case studies or detailed real-world examples.
Tone should be rigorous yet clear, similar to what might be found in a Harvard Business Review publication.
Length should approximate a 3-page document.
📘 Structure & Content Instructions:

1. Introduction (1 paragraph max)

Define what corporate strategy is in clear, academic terms.
Briefly position it within the larger landscape of business strategy (referencing six-type model is allowed but not necessary to explain all six).
2. Foundational Principles of Corporate Strategy
Use structured sections or bullet lists as needed. Focus on:

The scope of corporate strategy (e.g., entire organization, multi-business-unit, portfolio-level).
Its temporal horizon (long-term, often multi-year).
The primary decision-makers (CEOs, boards, founders).
The core strategic questions (e.g., “What businesses should we be in?” “How should we allocate capital across units?”).
3. How Corporate Strategy Differs from Other Strategic Types

Provide conceptual contrast (e.g., how it differs from business-level or innovation strategy).
Mention overlapping boundaries and clarify using abstract distinctions (avoid examples like “Disney buying Marvel”).
4. Strategic Patterns & Archetypes (Optional)

If helpful, outline patterns like “portfolio expansion,” “conglomerate diversification,” or “focus strategy” as conceptual archetypes—without suggesting their use.
Note that these are observed patterns in corporate decision-making, not prescriptive templates.
5. Frameworks & Analytical Lenses

Briefly introduce frameworks like Porter’s Five Forces, SWOT, Ansoff Matrix, or GE/McKinsey Matrix—explained not as how-tos, but as models historically used to structure corporate-level thinking.
6. Common Misconceptions

Clarify what corporate strategy is not (e.g., it is not operational planning, not product-level innovation, not short-term tactics).
Mention that while it influences all layers below it, corporate strategy operates at a distinct abstraction level.
7. Navigating Ambiguity

Discuss how corporate strategy decisions are often fluid, multi-layered, and involve ambiguity.
Encourage recognizing strategic intent, scope, and impact horizon as diagnostic cues for identifying true corporate strategy.
8. Closing Reflection

Emphasize that understanding corporate strategy allows non-strategists to better recognize when they’re observing it in the wild—and to ask smarter questions during research or design phases.
🧠 GPT-4o Thinking Instructions (Chain-of-Thought)

Before you write, reflect on the audience: product thinkers who need clarity to inform research, not executives or strategists.
Think through the edges and overlaps of corporate strategy vs. other types—express these distinctions abstractly and cleanly.
Avoid buzzwords. Use academic rigor but explain terms clearly.
Think structurally—each section should build conceptually on the last.
Review and ensure the final piece is free from implied recommendations.

Could you help me find a jobs as a senior or lead product designer or user experience designer ideally, I'm looking for a job that can sponsor my visa so I'm currently on an HR visa and I need companies that have enough resources to support that.

Thanks for sharing these details! To better tailor the job search, could you specify the industries or types of companies you're most interested in (e.g., tech startups, fintech, SaaS, healthcare, etc.)? Also, do you have any preferences for remote, hybrid, or in-office roles? Lastly, would you like me to prioritize companies with a strong history of visa sponsorship or just those open to it?

## You (2025-02-12T15:47:56.029930+00:00)

## You (2025-02-12T16:04:30.405679+00:00)

I would like to know some statistics on the likelihood of getting a job without a referral at various companies. In the past, I've asked friends to refer me, but I keep receiving rejection after rejection. This has made me feel awkward about asking for a referral again.

Typically, I’ve contacted someone in a managerial position at the company via email or a call to start a conversation. If things go well, they usually encourage me to apply and offer to lead my profile through the process.

However, in your previous response, I was hoping to receive a list of about 200 companies to which I could apply directly, as the list you provided was quite short for my needs.

## ChatGPT (2025-02-12T16:04:42.826277+00:00)

I understand your request for a broader list of companies and statistics on the likelihood of getting a job without a referral. To refine my research, could you clarify the following:

- Do you want the list to specifically include companies with a strong history of visa sponsorship (H1B)?
- Should the list focus on companies in the tech sector, or are you open to other industries where UX/Product Designers are needed?
- Are there any company size preferences (startups, mid-size, enterprise)?
- Would you like the statistics to cover general hiring trends for UX/Product Designers, or should they be specific to the companies on the list?

Once I have this info, I'll get started on finding a much larger set of companies and relevant hiring data.

## You (2025-02-12T16:06:20.806924+00:00)

For the first question, I'm specifically looking for companies with a strong history of sponsoring visas. For the second question, yes, I am open to exploring other industries where UX and product designers are needed. I'm completely open to that. For the third question, I don't have any preferences regarding company size; however, if a startup is too small, they may not have the resources necessary for visa sponsorship. As for the fourth question, I would like a general overview of the statistics for small, medium, and large companies. I understand that you may not be able to analyze every company on the list, and that’s fine; I just need a brief overview.

## ChatGPT (2025-02-12T16:06:42.605915+00:00)

Understood! I will compile a list of approximately 200 companies with a strong history of visa sponsorship (H1B) that are hiring UX and Product Designers across various industries. The list will focus on companies large enough to have the resources for visa sponsorship, avoiding very small startups. Additionally, I will gather general statistics on the likelihood of getting hired without a referral, segmented by small, medium, and large companies. This will provide an overview of your chances when applying directly versus through a referral.

# Hiring Probability: Referrals vs. No Referral (By Company Size)

Getting hired as a UX or Product Designer can be **significantly easier with an employee referral**. Referral candidates often have a much higher success rate than those who apply without a connection. Below are general statistics and estimates of the likelihood of being hired **with vs. without a referral**, broken down by company size (small, medium, large). *(Precise numbers can vary, but industry-wide trends give a sense of the advantage referrals provide. In the absence of company-specific data, we use general hiring data and apply it to UX/Product Design roles.)*

- **Large Companies (Thousands of employees):** At big firms (think Fortune 500 tech companies), the hiring funnel is extremely competitive. A **non-referred applicant** might face long odds – perhaps only around **1–2%** of applicants ultimately get hired in popular roles. However, a **referred candidate’s chances are substantially higher**, often on the order of **5–10% or more**. In other words, an internal referral can make you several times more likely to land the job. For example, one large-scale analysis found referred candidates were **7 times more likely** to be hired than those who applied via job boards【8†L11-L15】. Similarly, referred employees in general had about a **30% hiring rate vs. roughly 7% for non-referrals** on average【9†L33-L41】. This suggests that at a large company, an applicant with a referral might have perhaps a ~10% chance of an offer (given they often get fast-tracked to interviews), compared to maybe ~1–2% without a referral. **In summary:** referrals dramatically improve odds at large organizations, turning a long-shot application into something with a tangible chance【9†L33-L37】【9†L38-L41】.

- **Mid-Sized Companies (Hundreds to a few thousand employees):** Medium-sized firms tend to have less overwhelming applicant volume than giants like Google or Amazon, but referrals still provide a clear boost. A **non-referred candidate** at a mid-size tech or design-focused company might have maybe a **5% (1 in 20)** chance of getting hired (since these firms still screen many applicants, but not as many as Big Tech). With a **referral**, that probability could rise to on the order of **15–20%**. In other words, you might be **3 to 4 times more likely** to get the job with an internal referral at a mid-size company. This aligns with industry findings that referred candidates are about **4 times more likely to be hired** overall than non-referred ones【12†L17-L19】. Mid-sized companies often fill a good portion of roles through employee networks (referrals can account for ~15% of all hires in companies under 5,000 employees)【9†L11-L18】, so while it’s certainly possible to get in without one, a referral greatly increases your odds of making it through the interview process.

- **Small Companies (Startups or firms <100 employees):** Smaller companies often rely even more on personal networks and referrals to find trustworthy hires, especially for critical roles. In a small startup or studio, the **baseline hiring rate** for an applicant might be relatively higher (for instance, if only a handful of people apply per opening, perhaps **10% or more** of those applicants eventually get hired). But a **referred candidate** at a small company can have an especially strong advantage – they may almost be treated as a “known quantity.” It’s not uncommon for referrals to make up a large share of hires at startups. In fact, referrals are **most likely to result in a job offer at companies with fewer than 100 employees**【9†L21-L24】. A referred applicant might have a very high chance of getting hired (estimate on the order of **20–30%** or even more in some cases), whereas someone without a referral might have closer to a **5–10%** chance. Thus, while small companies might give any qualified applicant a decent shot, **a referral still significantly boosts the probability of an offer**. It both increases the likelihood of getting an interview and signals cultural fit/trust to the hiring team, which can tip the scales in your favor.

**Key Takeaway:** Across all company sizes, **having a referral greatly improves your chances** of landing a UX/Product Design job. Industry-wide data shows referred candidates are *4–7 times more likely* to be hired than non-referred applicants【12†L17-L19】【8†L11-L15】. For UX and product design roles, this trend holds true – being recommended by an insider can help you cut through the competition. Large companies see the biggest gap in absolute terms (since without a referral the odds are so low), while small companies see the highest overall success rates for referrals (since they trust network recommendations heavily). **In practical terms:** if you apply cold to a job, the odds might be in the single digits percent, but with a referral, you could be looking at a double-digit percentage chance of getting hired【9†L33-L41】. Leveraging referrals (through alumni, former colleagues, or professional networks) is one of the most effective strategies to improve your hiring probability in the UX/Product Design field.

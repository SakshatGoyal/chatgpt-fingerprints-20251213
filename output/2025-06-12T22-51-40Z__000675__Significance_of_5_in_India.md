### 🕉️ **Why 5?**
In Indian cosmology and daily life, **five** is considered a number of **balance, wholeness, and sensory completeness**:

- We have **5 senses** (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste)
- Our **hands and feet** have **5 fingers/toes** — symbols of karma (action)
- Rituals often require **five offerings**, **five lamps**, or **five rounds**

It's a number that often suggests **totality in multiplicity** — a spiritual metaphor for diversity contained in harmony.

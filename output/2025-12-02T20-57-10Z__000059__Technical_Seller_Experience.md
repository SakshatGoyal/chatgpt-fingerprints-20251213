### 🔹 PART 1: CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS & SYNTHESIS

> **You are to act with a dual mindset:**
>
> * As a **Technical Sales Executive at Palo Alto Networks**, focused on opportunity lifecycle, proof of value (POV), technical win processes, and solution consultant workflows.
> * As a **Design Manager at IDEO**, experienced in turning ambiguous, messy stakeholder input into clear, structured insights for platform design.

---

### 🧠 TASK

You have been provided:

* A **meeting transcript** containing detailed conversations about the Technical Seller Experience (TSX) platform.
* A set of **screenshots with timestamps** that were captured during the meeting.

Your task is to:

1. **Read and internalize the transcript in full.**
2. **Bind transcript sections to screenshots based on timestamps.**
   If a screenshot was taken at 01:00, and a transcript segment spans 00:55–01:20, you must treat the screenshot as a visual reference for that entire segment. This alignment remains active **until the next screenshot timestamp**.
3. **Build a coherent, unified mental model** of what was discussed — including goals, modules, flows, pain points, language used, and any strategic intent.

---

### 🧾 OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a detailed **contextual synthesis** that includes:

---

#### 🧩 1. Unified Narrative

A complete, linear summary of what was discussed — with:

* Key concepts
* Module breakdowns
* Implicit priorities
* Friction points
* Any interconnections between modules or personas

Write it as if you are building a **mental story for yourself** so that future design or sales decisions can refer to it.

---

#### 🖼️ 2. Screenshot-Transcript Alignment

List each screenshot like this:

```
[ Screenshot – 01:00 ]
→ Transcript aligned: 00:55–01:20  
→ Context summary: [Explain what’s happening in this segment, why it matters, and how the visual and verbal cues connect.]
```

Do this for **each screenshot** to explicitly tie visuals to verbal content.

---

#### 📌 3. Design-Relevant Signals

Surface any content that is especially useful for downstream design work. For example:

* Moments of confusion or vague terminology
* Stakeholders referring to unmet needs or known gaps
* Ambiguity or assumptions in the way modules or personas are described
* Decisions deferred or things said to be figured out “later”

Label this section:

> **Design-Relevant Signals: What Needs Further Interpretation**

---

### 🚫 DO NOT:

* Generate scope documents
* Write user stories
* Invent modules or features not explicitly mentioned
* Fill in technical or design gaps yourself

---

### 🧑‍💼 Persona Voice

Respond in a **professional synthesis tone**, as if writing an internal analysis memo between product, design, and sales leads at Palo Alto Networks.

### 1. Unified Narrative – “What this meeting was really about”

The meeting is an overview with Chris walking Sakshat (and later Marc) through the **Technical Seller Experience (TSX)** concept for the **Solution Consultant / Sales Engineer (SC)** persona. The goal is to frame what a **Technical Seller Workbench** should contain and how it supports the **tech journey from opportunity identification to tech win / loss**, while hinting at how an AI-powered copilot could sit on top of this.

At a high level:

- **Persona & role.**  
  The SC/Technical Seller is paired with a core sales rep on each deal (“two in a box”). The rep owns the broader account and forecast; the technical seller focuses deeply on **opportunities and technical validation**. Their success is measured in **tech wins** on opportunities, which then translate into booked deals and compensation.fileciteturn0file0  

- **Why a separate workbench.**  
  The SC needs a **one-place workbench** distinct from (but connected to) the rep workbench and future Success Manager workbench. The common object across personas is **Opportunity**; this is where their worlds “converge.” Outside that, the TSX is optimized for technical workflows, collaboration with domain specialists (DCs), and creation/use of artifacts.

- **TSX module landscape (from the “TSX Modules” slide).**  
  Chris walks through a conceptual module map:
  - **Top “capabilities belts”:**  
    - *Opportunity Management* – shared view of deals aligned with the rep, so there is no “different lens” between rep and SC.  
    - *Sales Tech Onboarding* – enablement for new technical sellers and managers (similar to Sales IQ), feeding them technical docs, white papers, etc.  
    - *Reports & Analytics* including SFDC and non-SFDC reports – Chris notes he still needs to learn **which reports matter most** to this persona.  
    - *TSX Access & Integrations* – controlling profile-based access and integrating external tools the SCs already use.
  - **TSX Homepage area:** TH360 engagement, guided journey view, Technical Resource Request, Event Management, Task Management, Notifications, and a TSX Journey Overview “at a glance.” This is the daily cockpit where an SC should see **where they are in the technical journey and what’s next.**
  - **TSX Guided Journey (Workflow):**  
    - *POV Workflow* – Customer Environment POV, Managed POV, POV Proposal, POV Execution Workflow, POV Test Plan, POV Executive Playback.  
    - *Non-POV Validations* – Product demos, performance reports, express testing, reference calls, hands-on workshops/Ultimate Test Drive, and building a customer sandbox (BYOS).  
    This is the heart of the **tech validation engine**: deciding whether to run a full Proof of Value (POV/POC) or keep it “lighter-weight” with non-POV options.
  - **TSX Artifacts:**  
    Templates & document storage, Design of Record (DOR), Account Success Plans, Non-POV artifacts, POV content (test plan, proposal), and POV executive playback views. This is the **knowledge and content spine** that supports all technical selling.

  Color coding on the module slide distinguishes **existing tools vs. to-be-built vs. candidate buy/build**, plus a legend on integration depth (data sharing, object association, automation, UX stitching).

- **Technical journey states.**  
  Chris then shows the **“Technical Journey | Tech States Criteria, Processes, and Outputs”** table. It defines a 0–8 journey:

  | State | Meaning (simplified) |
  |-------|----------------------|
  | 0 | Opportunity Identification – sales rep creates opp. |
  | 1 | Tech Discovery – qualified opp; need to decide if tech validation/POV is required. |
  | 2 | Non-POV Tech Validation – run demos, reports, HOWs, etc. |
  | 3 | POV Planning – POV is required; plan the business value exercise. |
  | 4 | POV Tech Validation – execute POV test plan. |
  | 5 | Tech Decision Pending – all testing done; waiting for customer decision. |
  | 6 | Tech Loss – Closed. |
  | 7 | Tech Win – Closed. |
  | 8 | No Tech Validation – Closed (opportunity didn’t require a tech cycle). |

  For each state, the table specifies **entry criteria, exit criteria, key processes, tools/artifacts, and outputs** – e.g., DOR templates, POV proposals, test plans, and executive playbacks. This is effectively the **operating model** for technical selling, independent of the UI.

- **Project workflow and collaboration (Lucidchart flow).**  
  Chris pivots to a **Lucidchart flow** that maps how TSX orchestrates work:

  1. **New TSX Project** is created for an opportunity.
  2. **TSX Project Workspace:** Add internal team members and create a TSX content folder (today this is one-off drives/docs; future: automated project drive + team management).
  3. **Discovery / Design of Record (DOR):** Use a companion app to create the DOR – essentially a structured discovery questionnaire that captures the customer’s current environment, security posture, and solution interests.
  4. **Add Resources to TSX Team:** Through a **Technical Resource Request**, the SC can pull in **Domain Consultants (DCs)** (e.g., SASE, Cortex) and other SMEs to support the POV.
  5. From here, the flow **branches into Non-POV or POV**:
     - **Non-POV Companion App:** BYOS sandboxes, performance reports, hands-on workshops, reference calls, industry reports, and (future) AI-based recommendation outputs.
     - **POV Companion App:** POV Huddle, POV Test Plan App, POV Proposal App, POV Request, POV Playback App, and future bot/AI features. This path includes provisioning of trial/tenant environments and rigorous test plans.
  6. **Tech Closure:** Update the DOR with final technical conclusions.
  7. **Post-Sales Transition:** Share DOR and relevant artifacts with Customer Success, kicking off the Success Manager persona’s world.

  This reinforces that the SC role is **project-oriented**, coordinating a joint team across Palo Alto and the customer and using TSX to manage that lifecycle.

- **Artifacts and the AI copilot vision.**  
  Chris emphasizes that SCs are “into documentation” – they think like architects and rely heavily on diagrams, blueprints, and structured docs. Today these live in Google Drive-style storage and are **scattered across decks, sheets, docs, and diagrams**.  
  A major part of the TSX vision is for an **AI/copilot on the right-hand side** to:
  - Retrieve **all relevant artifacts** for a given account or opportunity (“give me all design records and success plans for this account”).  
  - Eventually **draft or assemble artifacts automatically** (DORs, test plans, proposals, playback decks), using the structured data from the journey and project apps.
  This is where your GPT/assistant work is expected to plug in.

- **Relationship to existing rep and success workbenches.**  
  When Marc joins, he checks whether this is a new dashboard/workbench or something else. Chris clarifies:
  - Yes, **TSX is another workbench** alongside the two you’ve already built for reps.  
  - Overlap is **only at the Opportunity and Account objects**, where rep and SC see the same data (including forecast).  
  - The **handoff to Customer Success** happens after tech win; TSX must feed a rich set of artifacts and DOR updates into the Success Manager world.

- **Prioritization and build/buy thinking.**  
  A later slide lists the 10 modules (Tech Sales Onboarding, POC/POV Management, Workflow, Templates & Document Storage, Calendar/Event Management, User Experience, Opportunity Management, Task Management, Knowledge Management, Reports & Analytics) with **Business Priority scores and “Build/Buy/Existing” tags**. This is the start of a **fit-gap/roadmap discussion**, but the call doesn’t go deep into it.

- **Zooming into one concrete workflow: Express Testing.**  
  The final slide you shared gives a user-story-style breakdown for **“Request Test Report (aka Express Testing) – Non-POV”** for the Solution Consultant. The numbered steps cover:
  - Navigating to the **Test Report Library** from a “Tech State 2” panel.
  - Requesting a new test report via an SFDC POC Request / Express Testing shortcut.
  - Tracking report progress via status data in SFDC.
  - Adding completed test reports into TSX Guided Journey artifacts.  
  The slide itself contains **inline design questions** about navigation patterns and data linking (see section 3).

### 2. Screenshot–Transcript Alignment

**[ Screenshot – 02:44 – “TSX Modules” ]**  
→ **Transcript aligned:** ~02:23–11:12 (Chris’s walkthrough of modules and homepage components, plus Sakshat’s “we’ll need drill-down later” comment).  
→ **Context summary:** Chris introduces the **overall TSX module map**, explaining the distinction between opportunity-focused technical sellers and account-focused reps, the need for aligned opportunity views, and the main TSX modules (Homepage, Guided Journey, Artifacts, Access & Integrations). He points out that SCs also use **many external tools outside SFDC**, and that integrations and access control are foundational. The slide acts as the **systems-level inventory** of what a Technical Seller Workbench must expose.

---

**[ Screenshot – 12:26 – “Technical Journey | Tech States Criteria, Processes, and Outputs” ]**  
→ **Transcript aligned:** ~11:54–13:56 (Chris switches to “the different entry and exit criteria” and explains states 0–8 and POV vs non-POV outcomes).  
→ **Context summary:** Chris translates the static module map into a **state-machine view of the technical journey**, from opportunity identification to tech win/loss or “no tech validation.” For each state, he describes why it starts, what triggers moving on, what processes are run, and which artifacts are produced (DOR, POV proposal, test plan, playback, etc.). This is where he clarifies **POV = Proof of Value**, emphasizes the cost of POVs, and highlights that sometimes a **lightweight non-POV path** is sufficient.

---

**[ Screenshot – 24:47 – TSX Project Flow (left/mid section) ]**  
→ **Transcript aligned:** ~21:17–28:26 (Chris opens the Lucidchart, discusses creating a TSX project, DOR, resource requests, and the role of Domain Consultants).  
→ **Context summary:** Chris explains how an SC **sets up and runs a project** for an opportunity:
- Create a **TSX Project Workspace**, add team members, and create a content folder.  
- Use a **DOR Companion App** to capture discovery and design intent.  
- Submit **Tech Resource Requests** to add DCs and other SMEs.  
He emphasizes that technical sellers are **project-oriented**, coordinating both **Palo Alto and customer technical teams**. The screenshot anchors these concepts in a visual, sequential flow.

**[ Screenshot – 28:26 – TSX Project Flow (full journey including POV / non-POV, Tech Closure, Post-Sales) ]**  
→ **Transcript aligned:** ~24:47–29:07 (Chris continues describing non-POV vs POV paths, recommended AI capabilities, and transition to tech win/loss and Customer Success).  
→ **Context summary:** The full flow shows how, once a project is set up:
- SCs choose between **Non-POV** (catalog of services/tools) and **POV** (apps for huddles, proposals, test plans, playback) companion apps.  
- Future states include **AI-driven recommendations** and bot-assisted workflows.  
- After execution, the **DOR is updated**, and artifacts flow into **Post-Sales Transition** for the Customer Success persona.  
This screenshot visually embodies the **end-to-end lifecycle** and the intended **touchpoints for AI automation.**

---

**[ Screenshot – 29:38 – Module Fit/Gap & Priority Table ]**  
→ **Transcript aligned:** ~28:23–30:12 (Marc questions whether this is a new workbench; Chris talks about it being “action-oriented with AI,” then pivots to artifacts and templates).  
→ **Context summary:** The table lists the ten TSX modules, **business priority rankings**, and whether the current thinking is to **Build**, **Buy or Build**, or rely on **Existing** solutions, with rationales (e.g., existing use of Google Suite/theLoop for templates, CRM for opp & task management, Tableau/GCP for analytics). While not discussed in depth on the call, it captures **stakeholder assumptions about effort vs. leverage** across modules and is an implicit **roadmap input**.

---

**[ Screenshot – 30:57 – “Workflow | Request Test Report (aka Express Testing) (Non-POV)” ]**  
→ **Transcript aligned:** ~30:12–end (Chris shows examples of artifacts, mentions DOR, success plan, non-POV artifacts, and POV playback).  
→ **Context summary:** This slide zooms down to a **specific non-POV workflow** for the Solution Consultant: requesting and tracking express test reports. It gives stepwise instructions (navigate to Test Report Library, request a report, monitor progress, attach to Guided Journey artifacts) and surfaces **explicit UX questions** in blue text about:  
- Whether the Test Report Library should be surfaced in a modal vs. full jump-out.  
- How to **link POC Request data** (engineer, status, completion info) back into TSX.  
This is one of the clearest examples of **user-story-level detail** plus **open design questions**.

---

### 3. Design-Relevant Signals: What Needs Further Interpretation

**A. Concept & language clarity**

1. **“Engagement” vs. “Journey” vs. “Project.”**  
   - TSX Homepage references “TH360 Engagement,” “Opportunity Guided Journey View,” and “TSX Journey Overview,” while the flow shows “New TSX Project” and “TSX Project Workspace.”  
   - It’s not fully clear whether **Journey, Engagement, and Project** are separate objects, synonyms, or different views of the same underlying construct.

2. **POV vs POC terminology.**  
   - Chris uses POV (Proof of Value) but notes people sometimes say POC; they’re treated as conceptually similar but there may be **different internal expectations** (e.g., business-value emphasis vs. pure technical feasibility).

3. **Definition of “Non-POV Tech Validation.”**  
   - The non-POV path bundles **demos, reports, express testing, reference calls, workshops, and BYOS sandboxes**.  
   - There is no clear **prioritization logic** about when each option is appropriate, or how an SC decides which non-POV tools to pull into a given opportunity.

4. **Artifacts taxonomy.**  
   - The artifacts slide lists DOR, Success Plan, Non-POV artifacts, Test Plan, Proposal, POV Playback.  
   - It’s not yet clear how these **map to concrete file types**, which ones are **mandatory vs optional**, or **how versioning and reuse** should work.

---

**B. Signals about unmet needs / friction**

1. **External tools sprawl.**  
   - SCs “build their own set of tools outside Salesforce,” but the specific tools and use-cases are not enumerated. This is a **major integration and adoption risk** for TSX: if external tools remain the primary place where work happens, TSX may become a reporting layer rather than a true cockpit.

2. **Reports & Analytics are poorly understood.**  
   - Chris explicitly says he needs to find out **which reports they care about most**. That means the current vision for “Reports & Analytics” is **underspecified** and may not yet be aligned to how SCs judge pipeline, POV health, or tech-win performance.

3. **Heavy manual project management.**  
   - Today, project tracking is described as **manual**, with one-off drives, manual team tracking, and SFDC TRR requests.  
   - Technical sellers are implicitly acting as **project managers**, but there is no crisp description of what they struggle with today (missed follow-ups, unclear ownership, conflicting asks, etc.).

4. **Cost and risk of POVs.**  
   - POVs are described as **expensive and involved**; one driver for TSX seems to be **choosing when a POV is justified** and ensuring it’s executed efficiently.  
   - There’s no explicit discussion of **how often POVs fail, stall, or change scope**—which would be critical for design decisions around guardrails, risk flags, and AI recommendations.

---

**C. AI/Copilot expectations that need grounding**

1. **“Action-oriented with AI-powered recommendations.”**  
   - Chris frames TSX as a workbench that is **action first**, with AI both recommending next steps and **auto-creating artifacts**.  
   - The exact **decision inputs** for these recommendations (journey state, product line, customer profile, past deals, etc.) are not yet articulated.

2. **Artifact retrieval & generation.**  
   - Desired copilot behaviors include: “give me what we did for this account,” or “tell me relevant documents for this account I’m trying to run a POV on,” and ultimately **automatic drafting** of DORs, test plans, proposals, and playback decks.  
   - There’s no clarity yet on **minimum structured data** TSX will capture to make this feasible (fields, relationships, tagging) or **which artifacts are safe to auto-draft vs must be human-led.**

3. **AI in Non-POV/POV companion apps.**  
   - Future enhancements mention “AI capabilities” and “bot recommendations” in both non-POV and POV flows.  
   - The boundary between **lightweight suggestions** (e.g., which non-POV options to pick) and **heavier automation** (e.g., configuring a sandbox, generating a test plan) is still open.

---

**D. Explicit open questions surfaced in slides**

From the **Express Testing workflow slide**:

- “**Can IT modal the library site or is a jump-out required?**”  
  → Open question about **navigation and containment**: should the Test Report Library feel like a native TSX experience (modal/embedded) or a linked external system?

- “**Possible to link POC Request data view in TSX? Example would be POV Engineer, status, completed information.**”  
  → Open question about **data integration** and how deeply TSX should expose SFDC POC Request data (just status? full object? ability to edit?).

These are prime candidates for **follow-up design working sessions** to clarify constraints and expectations around existing IT systems and SFDC objects.

---

**E. Assumptions, dependencies, and missing information**

To move into design safely, these areas likely need further clarification:

1. **Canonical objects & data model.**
   - How exactly are **Opportunity, TSX Project, Journey State, DOR, Artifacts, and TRRs** related in the underlying data model?  
   - Are all journeys strictly **opportunity-scoped**, or can one project span multiple opportunities or accounts?

2. **Persona ecosystem & boundaries.**
   - Clear definition of the **handshake** between:
     - Rep ↔ Technical Seller (when and how the opportunity is handed over, what remains shared).  
     - Technical Seller ↔ Customer Success (which artifacts are mandatory for post-sales, what “good handoff” looks like).

3. **Current-state pain points.**
   - Beyond high-level statements (manual tracking, scattered artifacts, many external tools), there’s limited concrete data on:
     - Where SCs currently **lose time or confidence**.  
     - Where deals drop between **tech states** (e.g., most churn at state 3 vs state 5).  
     - The **emotional texture** of their day (fire-fighting, context switching, executive pressure, etc.).

4. **Success metrics for TSX.**
   - What are leadership’s priority outcomes: reduced POV cycle time, higher tech-win rate, improved reuse of artifacts, fewer tools, better forecasting accuracy, etc.?  
   - These will strongly influence which modules and AI capabilities matter most.

5. **Governance & content quality.**
   - For artifacts like DORs and Success Plans, who owns **quality and approval**?  
   - How are **templates standardized** across regions and product lines today, and what flexibility is required?

6. **Constraints from SFDC and existing IT landscape.**
   - The slides hint at multiple companion apps and integrations; design choices will depend on:
     - What IT is willing to embed vs. jump-out.  
     - Existing **custom objects, flows, and security models** in SFDC.  
     - Limits on data residency, permissions, and sharing, especially for sensitive customer artifacts.

## 🔹 Objective #1: Make “The Technical Journey” Concrete and Navigable

**Problem Statement**  
The technical journey is well-defined conceptually (states 0–8 with entry/exit criteria) but not yet **visibly embodied** in TSX. Terms like *engagement, journey, project* are used interchangeably, and it is unclear how a Technical Seller sees “where I am” and “what is next” in a given opportunity.

**Functional Modules Affected**

- TSX Homepage (TSX Journey Overview, Opportunity Guided Journey View)  
- TSX Guided Journey (Workflow – POV and Non-POV)  
- Tech States framework (0–8)  
- Opportunity Management

**Design Considerations**

- The journey must behave like a **state machine with memory**, not just a checklist.  
- Naming and IA should reconcile “TSX Project,” “Engagement,” and “Journey” into a coherent mental model.  
- Each state should clearly surface:
  - Current state, next eligible states  
  - Required activities/artifacts to progress  
  - Risks if the state is stalled
- Must align with the shared **Opportunity** object so that rep and Technical Seller see consistent status.

**Screenshot & Transcript References**

- [Screenshot – 12:26] (Tech States Criteria, Processes, and Outputs)  
- [Transcript – ~11:54–13:56] – explanation of states 0–8, POV vs Non-POV  
- [Screenshot – 02:44] – TSX Modules, Journey Overview and Guided Journey

**Detailed User Stories**

- *As a Technical Seller, I want to see the current technical state for each opportunity and what actions are required to move forward, so that I can systematically progress opportunities toward a technical win.*  

- *As a Technical Seller, I want TSX to show me when an opportunity has been stuck in the same technical state for too long, so that I can proactively re-engage stakeholders or adjust the validation plan.*  

- *As a Technical Seller, I want a single “technical journey” view that clearly explains the relationship between the TSX Project, the Engagement, and the Opportunity, so that I am not guessing which object drives my workflow.*

---

## 🔹 Objective #2: Clarify and Operationalize POV vs Non-POV Decisioning

**Problem Statement**  
The distinction between **Proof of Value (POV)** and **Non-POV Tech Validation** is conceptually described but operationally fuzzy. The system does not yet help Technical Sellers decide **whether a POV is warranted**, which Non-POV options to use, or how to justify the cost and effort.

**Functional Modules Affected**

- TSX Guided Journey (POV Workflow and Non-POV Validations)  
- Non-POV Companion App (BYOS, performance reports, workshops, reference calls, express testing)  
- POV Companion App (POV Huddle, Test Plan, Proposal, Playback)  
- Tech States 2–5 (Non-POV Tech Validation, POV Planning, POV Tech Validation, Tech Decision Pending)

**Design Considerations**

- The decision between Non-POV and POV should be **explicit**:
  - Triggers/criteria (deal size, complexity, risk, competitive pressure).  
  - Impact on effort, time, and resource consumption.
- TSX should offer **guided recommendations** but maintain seller control.  
- Each path must expose **expected outputs** (e.g., test plan, playback, reports) so sellers can set expectations with customers.

**Screenshot & Transcript References**

- [Screenshot – 12:26] – Tech states and associated processes  
- [Screenshot – 28:26] – Full journey including Non-POV and POV branches  
- [Transcript – ~13:30–18:00] – discussion of POV cost and Non-POV options

**Detailed User Stories**

- *As a Technical Seller, I want TSX to highlight whether a given opportunity appears to require a full Proof of Value or can be handled with Non-Proof of Value options, so that I can choose the lightest effective validation path.*  

- *As a Technical Seller, I want to see recommended Non-Proof of Value options (for example, performance reports, reference calls, workshops) based on the opportunity profile, so that I can confidently propose a lean validation plan when a full Proof of Value is not justified.*  

- *As a Technical Seller, I want TSX to summarize the expected effort, duration, and resources for a proposed Proof of Value, so that I can align customer and internal stakeholders before committing.*

---

## 🔹 Objective #3: Orchestrate Projects and Resources Without Manual Workarounds

**Problem Statement**  
Technical Sellers are effectively **project managers** for each opportunity, but today rely on manual tracking, one-off folders, and separate systems for resource requests and team management. TSX needs to provide a **cohesive project workspace** anchored to the opportunity.

**Functional Modules Affected**

- TSX Project Workspace (New TSX Project, Add Team Members, Create TSX Content Folder)  
- Tech Resource Request (Domain Consultant / SME onboarding)  
- Opportunity Management  
- Task Management and Notifications

**Design Considerations**

- “TSX Project” should feel like an **organizing container** for all people, tasks, and artifacts related to an opportunity’s technical work.  
- Resource requests (for Domain Consultants and specialists) should be:
  - Discoverable from the journey.  
  - Traceable (who was requested, status, assignments).  
- Project-level views should show:
  - Who is on the team (internal and customer).  
  - What is happening this week (tasks, workshops, test cycles).  
  - Key milestones tied to journey states.

**Screenshot & Transcript References**

- [Screenshot – 24:47] – left/mid section of TSX Project flow (Add Team Members, Create TSX Content Folder, Request DC)  
- [Screenshot – 28:26] – full journey including Non-POV and POV paths  
- [Transcript – ~21:17–28:26] – explanation of project-oriented nature of Technical Sellers and resource requests

**Detailed User Stories**

- *As a Technical Seller, I want to create a TSX Project directly from an opportunity and automatically invite core team members, so that I do not have to build separate ad-hoc tracking artifacts for each deal.*  

- *As a Technical Seller, I want to submit and track Technical Resource Requests for Domain Consultants within the same TSX Project workspace, so that I always know who has been requested, who is assigned, and what is pending.*  

- *As a Technical Seller, I want TSX to show a consolidated view of all project tasks, workshops, and testing milestones linked to the technical journey state, so that I can coordinate both internal and customer teams effectively.*

---

## 🔹 Objective #4: Govern the Artifact Lifecycle and Enable Fast Reuse

**Problem Statement**  
Artifacts such as **Design of Record (DOR)**, **Account Success Plans**, **Non-POV artifacts**, **POV test plans and proposals**, and **executive playbacks** are central to technical selling. Today they are scattered across drives and tools, making it hard to **find, reuse, and keep them aligned** with the technical journey and account history.

**Functional Modules Affected**

- TSX Artifacts (Templates & Document Storage, Design of Record, Account Success Plans, Non-POV Artifacts, POV Content, Executive Playback View)  
- TSX Guided Journey (where artifacts are produced and consumed)  
- AI/Copilot surface (future; right-hand artifact intelligence)

**Design Considerations**

- Each artifact type needs:
  - A **clear purpose** (when it is required, who consumes it).  
  - A **template or schema** (fields and structure).  
  - A relationship to **journey states** and **opportunities/accounts**.
- Artifact retrieval should be **contextual**:
  - “Show me everything we have for this opportunity.”  
  - “Show me comparable Design of Record documents for similar accounts.”  
- Future AI behavior depends on consistent metadata and structure; scope must define **minimum tagging and linkage**.

**Screenshot & Transcript References**

- [Screenshot – 02:44] – TSX Modules with TSX Artifacts panel  
- [Screenshot – 30:57] – Request Test Report workflow, adding artifacts to TSX Guided Journey  
- [Transcript – ~28:23–30:57] – discussion of artifacts and documentation culture

**Detailed User Stories**

- *As a Technical Seller, I want TSX to automatically organize Design of Record documents, test plans, proposals, and playback decks by opportunity and account, so that I can quickly find the latest approved version during customer conversations.*  

- *As a Technical Seller, I want to search TSX for past artifacts from similar opportunities (for example, same product family or industry), so that I can reuse proven structures and avoid rebuilding every Design of Record or test plan from scratch.*  

- *As a Technical Seller, I want TSX to indicate which artifacts are required before closing a technical state (for example, a completed Design of Record before Tech Win), so that I do not accidentally skip critical documentation.*

---

## 🔹 Objective #5: Integrate Non-POV “Express Testing” into the Core Journey

**Problem Statement**  
The **Request Test Report (Express Testing)** workflow is outlined in detail but is not yet smoothly integrated into TSX. There are open questions about navigation (modal vs jump-out) and data linkage to Salesforce requests, creating risk of **context switching and status ambiguity**.

**Functional Modules Affected**

- Non-POV Companion App – Express Testing  
- TSX Guided Journey – Tech State 2 panel  
- SFDC POC Request / Express Testing object and status  
- TSX Artifacts (Test Reports)

**Design Considerations**

- From the Technical Seller’s perspective, Express Testing should feel like **one continuous flow**:
  - Browse library → request report → track status → attach to journey artifacts.  
- UX should minimize jumping between systems; if jumps are required, TSX must maintain **breadcrumbs and context**.  
- Status of the underlying SFDC request (engineer, status, completion) must be **visible within TSX** to avoid double-checking elsewhere.

**Screenshot & Transcript References**

- [Screenshot – 30:57] – Workflow | Request Test Report (aka Express Testing)  
- [Transcript – ~30:12–end] – stepwise description and inline questions about modals and data linking

**Detailed User Stories**

- *As a Technical Seller, I want to open the Test Report Library from my Tech State 2 panel without losing my place in the TSX Guided Journey, so that I can evaluate available reports in context of the current opportunity.*  

- *As a Technical Seller, I want to submit a new Express Testing request from within TSX and automatically link it to the underlying Salesforce Proof of Concept request, so that I do not have to duplicate data entry.*  

- *As a Technical Seller, I want TSX to show the status of each Express Testing request (assigned engineer, in progress, completed) and notify me when a report is ready, so that I can promptly review and add it to my technical validation artifacts.*

---

## 🔹 Objective #6: Clarify Reports & Analytics Around Technical Outcomes

**Problem Statement**  
Reports & Analytics is recognized as a top module, but stakeholders do not yet know **which views matter most** to Technical Sellers. There is a risk of either recreating generic CRM reports or missing the **specific technical KPIs** that guide behavior (for example, tech win rates by product, POV cycle times, state-level leakage).

**Functional Modules Affected**

- Reports & Analytics (SFDC Reports and Dashboards, Non-SFDC Reports)  
- Opportunity Management (forecast alignment with reps)  
- TSX Guided Journey (state data feeding analytics)

**Design Considerations**

- Reporting should focus on **technical outcomes**, not just commercial ones:
  - Tech win / loss rates.  
  - Distribution and duration of tech states.  
  - Volume and impact of POV vs Non-POV paths.  
- TSX should support both:
  - **Individual seller views** (“my pipeline, my POV workload, my tech risk”).  
  - **Manager views** (patterns across teams, products, regions).  
- Design work must avoid over-building until there is clarity on **core questions Technical Sellers and managers actually ask**.

**Screenshot & Transcript References**

- [Screenshot – 02:44] – TSX Modules, Reports & Analytics area  
- [Screenshot – 29:38] – module priority table showing Reports & Analytics as Build with rationale  
- [Transcript – ~02:23–11:12, 28:23–29:38] – comments about needing to understand which reports matter

**Detailed User Stories**

- *As a Technical Seller, I want a dashboard that shows my opportunities by technical state, including how long each has been in that state, so that I can focus my attention on deals at risk of stalling.*  

- *As a Technical Sales Manager, I want to see tech win and tech loss patterns by product family and Non-Proof of Value versus Proof of Value path, so that I can coach my team on where to invest technical effort.*  

- *As a Technical Seller, I want to view a workload summary of open Proof of Value engagements and Non-Proof of Value activities, so that I can manage my time and avoid overcommitting to too many concurrent Proof of Value projects.*

---

## 🔹 Objective #7: Reduce Tool Sprawl and Context Switching

**Problem Statement**  
Technical Sellers currently rely on a mix of **external tools, drives, and Salesforce components**. TSX risks becoming just another layer unless it deliberately **anchors key workflows** and clarifies when and how to move between systems.

**Functional Modules Affected**

- TSX Access and Integrations  
- Templates & Document Storage (existing tools like Google Suite, theLoop)  
- Non-SFDC reports and external services  
- All companion apps (Non-POV and POV)

**Design Considerations**

- TSX should not attempt to replace every tool, but must clearly:
  - Define which actions are **“done in TSX”** versus **“opened from TSX”**.  
  - Provide consistent patterns for **jump-outs vs embedded views** (for example, Express Testing library).  
- Surface **integration depth icons/labels** (as hinted by the A/B/C/D legend in the TSX Modules slide) so users know what to expect when clicking.

**Screenshot & Transcript References**

- [Screenshot – 02:44] – TSX Modules and integration legend (A/B/C/D)  
- [Screenshot – 30:57] – open questions about modals vs jump-outs  
- [Transcript – ~02:23–11:12, 30:12–end] – remarks on external tools and integration questions

**Detailed User Stories**

- *As a Technical Seller, I want TSX to indicate whether a linked tool opens as an integrated view or an external application, so that I am not surprised by disruptive context switches.*  

- *As a Technical Seller, I want frequently used external tools (for example, document repositories or testing portals) accessible from a consistent TSX sidebar or panel, so that I do not have to maintain separate bookmark systems.*  

- *As a Technical Seller, I want TSX to remember where I was in the technical journey when I return from an external tool, so that I can resume my workflow without re-navigating.*

## ❓ Outstanding Gaps & Assumptions

These are areas that appear **underspecified** in the current material and will need focused discovery or decision-making before detailed design.

1. **Object Model and Relationships**
   - Exact relationship between **Opportunity, TSX Project, Journey State, DOR, Artifacts, and Resource Requests**.  
   - Whether one TSX Project can span multiple opportunities or products, or if it is strictly one-to-one with an opportunity.

2. **Clear Vocabulary for Core Concepts**
   - Final definitions and boundaries for **Engagement vs Journey vs Project**.  
   - Whether “Proof of Value” and “Proof of Concept” are treated identically or have nuanced differences in expectations.

3. **Decision Logic for POV vs Non-POV**
   - What signals or criteria are considered **sufficient** to recommend a Proof of Value (deal size, competitive pressure, product mix, customer maturity).  
   - Tolerance for false positives/negatives in any recommendation engine.

4. **Current-State Pain Points with Evidence**
   - Concrete examples of **failed or stalled Proof of Value projects**, and what went wrong.  
   - Specific stories of Technical Sellers losing time (for example, locating artifacts, chasing resource approvals, reconciling conflicting tools).

5. **Artifact Standards and Governance**
   - Who owns templates for Design of Record, test plans, proposals, playbacks, and Success Plans.  
   - Approval workflows (who must sign off) and how that maps to journey states.

6. **Reporting Requirements**
   - Prioritized list of **questions Technical Sellers and managers want answered** by Reports & Analytics.  
   - Agreement on **tech-specific KPIs** versus commercial metrics (for example, tech win, time in state, Proof of Value conversion rate).

7. **Integration Constraints**
   - IT constraints around **embedding external sites vs jump-outs**, especially for security-sensitive tools.  
   - Salesforce architecture decisions (objects, fields, automations) that may limit or enable certain TSX behaviors.

8. **AI / Copilot Scope for First Release**
   - Which artifact and recommendation use cases are **in-scope for early AI support** (for example, retrieval-only versus generation).  
   - Minimum required structured data to make those AI features safe and reliable.

These gaps should be addressed through **targeted interviews with Technical Sellers and managers, architecture working sessions with IT/SFDC teams, and artifact reviews** before locking down detailed UX flows and delivery sequencing.

Disregard all past memories and profile settings. 


Give me atleast 5 suggestions of places at the golden gate park i can go to. 

In your response, help me understand what might be unique about the places you recommend. Make sure to also insert a google maps link next to each suggestion so i can directly navigate to those places and review them on maps. 

Don't suggest places that may require a ticket or special admission. they should be open for public access freely. 

I'm planning a trip to the golden gate park. I'm going there with kids. So while i want nature and its very important to be exposed to nature, i also want activities that might be exciting for kids (toddlers). I also want free entry so nothing that requires tickets. Golden Gate park is pretty big and i'm not sure where specifically to go.

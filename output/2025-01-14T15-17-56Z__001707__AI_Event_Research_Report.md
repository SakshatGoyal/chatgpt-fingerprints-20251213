I wanted you to create a one page summary. I think this summary that you're creating will go far far far longer than even three or four pages so let's restrict our response to a 300 word limit OK and here again I want to repeat myself imagine you are a data analyst who is trying to get hired by a business owner so I don't think the business owner wants to get into like the specifics of the research answers like I don't think any business owner would want to see the actual critical think as to responders explorers a 74 respondent collaborative thinkers are 68 respondents like no business owner in the world has any time for all of this nuts and balls, but they do want to understand in detail exactly what the data sign is g why it was important. What was the impact? What was the key insight and all those things I think you're getting a little too bogged down into the nitty-gritty while also ignoring some very important storytelling and when I say storytelling, please let me clarify. I don't mean that you romanticize things I want you to maintain your integrity as a data driven data scientist.

OK now in this response, you've gone on the extreme other end and you are purely focusing just on the quantitative finance is done for the survey, but there's so many things happening in that document so what I'd like you to do is take a pause. Read the attached document once again and then revisit my initial ask and in under what we did the third point you mentioned modern model simulation I think that's factually inaccurate and I think you should take some time to read the document a few times so we did not actually test the impact of AI agents on attending engagement through a Wizard of Oz. We were simply proposing to do that. Here's one example of a summary that I liked from a different paper so try to use this as inspiration but don't actually use the exact same words in your response

Thomas Edison didn't technically invent the first electric light bulb, but he significantly improved and popularized it.

Before Edison, several inventors—including Humphry Davy, Frederick de Moleyns, Heinrich Göbel, and Joseph Swan—had already created early versions of electric lighting. Edison’s primary achievement in 1879 was developing a durable, practical incandescent bulb by using a carbon filament that lasted significantly longer than earlier designs.

His greatest contribution, however, was creating a complete electrical lighting system (power stations, wiring, sockets, switches) making practical electric lighting widely accessible.

So, while Edison didn't invent the bulb itself, his innovations made electric lighting practical for everyday use and commercialization.

I'm writing a line that makes me sound like someone from the 1800s who still survived. I had something like, "I'll be here... sharing a drink with Edisson's ghost and talking about the good old days when the bulb was a huge deal."

But give me other examples of writing this that are funny, but not based in a false claim like eddison inventing the bulb. Feel free to use other examples.

Here are a few playful alternatives that keep the humor and the vintage vibe without making historically inaccurate claims:

1. **"I'll still be here, reminiscing with Edison’s ghost about the days when stealing ideas was called 'collaboration.'"**

2. **"Catch me here, sipping whiskey with Tesla’s ghost, arguing over AC versus DC like it's still revolutionary."**

3. **"I'll linger around, playing cards with Mark Twain’s spirit and chuckling about that time electricity was the 'latest fad.'"**

4. **"You'll find me here, debating patent ethics with Edison’s ghost, just like the good old days."**

5. **"I’ll still be around, sharing jokes with the Wright brothers' ghosts about how humans thought flying machines were witchcraft."**

These retain historical accuracy while playfully nodding to past innovations and eccentricities.

What's the maximum allowed dozage for baclofen for an adult in a day?

## ChatGPT (2024-12-22T15:00:54.377435+00:00)

The maximum allowed dosage of **baclofen** for an adult depends on the condition being treated and the patient's response to the medication. However, the general guidelines are:

### **Maximum Dosage:**
- For **oral baclofen**, the maximum recommended daily dosage is **80 mg**, divided into 3–4 doses per day.
  - **Starting dose:** Typically begins at 5 mg three times a day and is gradually increased every 3 days to reduce the risk of side effects.

- For **intrathecal baclofen (via a pump):** The dosage varies significantly and is determined on a case-by-case basis by a healthcare provider. Intrathecal doses are much lower due to direct administration to the spinal cord.

### **Important Notes:**
- Doses higher than **80 mg per day** are not commonly recommended due to an increased risk of side effects like drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, and respiratory depression.
- Dosage increases should be done gradually under medical supervision.
- Abrupt discontinuation of baclofen can lead to withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and severe muscle spasticity.

Always follow a doctor's prescription for safe use. If you're considering a higher dose or have concerns, consult your healthcare provider.

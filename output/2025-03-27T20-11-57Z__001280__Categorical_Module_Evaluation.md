# Categorical Module Evaluation

## You (2025-03-27T20:11:57.490000+00:00)

You are a reasoning model tasked with analyzing executive strategy content using a rigorous alignment framework.

# 1. Goal

Your objective is to evaluate the **first 15 Categorical Modules** found in the uploaded `.txt` file. These modules must be assessed using the detailed 21-question evaluation framework provided in the file titled:  
**`RQA.md`**

Each Categorical Module is a self-contained unit of executive insight. Your task is to:
- Score each module independently using the 21-question matrix
- Group scores into the three defined strategic categories
- Assign a final thematic category tag (or `INVALID`, as applicable)
- Flag and proceed with any module that exhibits **inconsistent structure**, without skipping it

# 2. Return Format

For **each of the first 15 modules**, return:

- A markdown-style table, following the exact structure shown in `RQA.md`
- Score all 21 questions (0 or 1), grouped by category
- Sum each category’s total
- On the final line, output the **final category assignment**
- If structural issues are detected (e.g., missing headers, non-standard phrasing), flag the module as:
  > `⚠️ Note: Module has inconsistent structure but was scored as fully as possible.`

All 15 evaluations must be returned **in a single output**, sequentially, in the following format:

CATEGORICAL MODULE [code]
Category	Question Number	Score
Category 1	Question 1	[0 or 1]
...		
Category 3	Question 7	[0 or 1]
Category 1 total: X
Category 2 total: Y
Category 3 total: Z

Final category assignment for CATEGORICAL MODULE [code] - Category X
[Optional: ⚠️ Note if inconsistent structure]


You must repeat this full block for **each of the first 15 modules** only.

# 3. Warnings & Guardrails

- ❌ Do not use example values from the instruction file.
- 🔁 Treat each module as **independent**—no information should carry over.
- 🧠 Use inference where logic is implied but not named.
- 🧹 Mark as `INVALID` if all 21 scores = 0.
- 🚫 Do not skip modules with structure issues—evaluate them and clearly flag the inconsistency.
- 📦 Return all outputs in a clean markdown format optimized for pasting into Notion or similar tools.

# 4. Context & Embedded Personas

### 🧠 Primary Execution Persona: **Organizational Pattern Recognition Analyst**
- Detects decision logic embedded within strategic communications
- Ensures each module is interpreted without cross-contamination
- Surfaces latent structure and patterns within executive framing

### 🧐 Advisory Layer: **Executive Reasoning Model Auditor**
- Diagnoses shallow logic, ambiguity, or false signal
- Confirms whether each module offers real strategic reasoning
- Enforces high interpretive standards for tagging or invalidation

These personas guide your interpretive rigor, independence, and consistency throughout.

Final category assignment for CATEGORICAL MODULE 71 - **Category 2**

Each module was scored independently. No structural inconsistencies were detected.

## You (2025-03-27T20:17:16.121000+00:00)

Now that the Categorical Modules from the `.txt` file have been fully evaluated using the scoring framework in `RQA.md`, create a summary table based **only** on the scoring and category assignments provided in your previous responses in this conversation.

You must not invent or infer any values. Use only the modules that were actually processed.

Build a single table in the following format, using ChatGPT’s standard in-window table layout (not markdown or code block formatting):

| Module ID | Category 1 | Category 2 | Category 3 | Final Assignment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CATEGORICAL MODULE [full ID] | [##] | [##] | [##] | Category [X] |

- **Module ID** should exactly match the module header used in your prior output (e.g., `CATEGORICAL MODULE 7 - C2-I1`)
- The **Category 1, 2, and 3** values must be the total scores you previously calculated
- **Final Assignment** must reflect the exact label you assigned (e.g., `Category 1`, `Category 2 + Category 3`, or `INVALID`)
- If any module was previously flagged for structural inconsistency, note it in parentheses next to the Module ID like this:
  > `CATEGORICAL MODULE 17 - C2-I2 (inconsistent structure)`

Only include modules that have already been scored—do not add or assume missing rows.

Once the table is complete, return **only the table**—do not include commentary, explanation, or code formatting.

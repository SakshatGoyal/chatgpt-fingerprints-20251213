You're a product designer, who knows you're not designing a product. Could you read through this document and tell me questions you might ask the person who created this document?

## ChatGPT (2025-01-10T19:01:40.562224+00:00)

Here are some potential questions I might ask the person who created this document to clarify or improve understanding:

1. **Project Objectives & Deliverables**:
   - Can you provide more details about the expected format and content of the "culture e-book" to ensure alignment with your vision?
   - For the "Executive Newsletters," are there any specific recurring themes or topics to emphasize?
   - Regarding the "Knowledge Management Development for AI work," are there existing resources or frameworks that the deliverable should align with?

2. **Timelines**:
   - Are there any intermediate checkpoints or review phases between the milestones?
   - How flexible are the deadlines for deliverables if unexpected challenges arise?

3. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Can you elaborate on what constitutes "successful delivery" for each deliverable? For example, specific metrics, stakeholder feedback, or test results?

4. **Stakeholders and Communication**:
   - Who are the primary stakeholders for the deliverables, and how often will they review or provide feedback?
   - Is there a specific format or platform for the weekly progress updates (e.g., slides, emails, SharePoint)?

5. **Resource Allocation**:
   - What resources or tools will Cisco provide to support the supplier, such as access to internal platforms or documentation?
   - Are there specific technical skills or roles expected for the "Required Personnel" section that is currently marked as "N/A"?

6. **Financials**:
   - Can you clarify whether all supplier expenses need to be pre-approved, and are there caps or specific guidelines for reimbursable expenses?
   - Are there penalties beyond the "late delivery credit" if deliverables do not meet acceptance criteria?

7. **Risk Management**:
   - Are there contingency plans or buffers built into the timeline for potential delays or revisions?
   - Are there any foreseeable risks or challenges associated with this project that the supplier should be aware of?

8. **Training Framework**:
   - Is there an existing training framework that this deliverable should complement, or is this an entirely new development?
   - Are there specific job roles or departments this training framework should prioritize?

9. **General Terms**:
   - The SOW states that Cisco can remove personnel for "any reason or no reason." What protocols or expectations are in place for supplier staffing changes?

10. **Vendor Coordination**:
    - How will Cisco and the supplier handle change requests during the project to avoid scope creep?

Would you like me to refine or add more specific questions based on a particular section or focus?

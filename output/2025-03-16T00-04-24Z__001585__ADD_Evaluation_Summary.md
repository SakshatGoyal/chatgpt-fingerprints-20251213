# ADD Evaluation Summary

## You (2025-03-16T00:04:24.256000+00:00)

**Objective:**
Generate a structured, comprehensive, and easy-to-read summary for a psychiatrist based on the provided dictated notes. The summary should ensure clarity and conciseness while maintaining all essential details necessary for the psychiatrist to understand the patient’s experiences, symptoms, and past medical interactions.

---

**Context:**
- The patient is seeking an ADD evaluation with a new psychiatrist outside of their current medical network (Kaiser).
- The provided notes cover a broad range of experiences, including symptoms, daily life impact, medical interactions, external recommendations, and past treatments.
- A portion of the notes details miscommunications with previous medical providers, but this represents only a fraction of the overall content. The summary should ensure this aspect is given appropriate weight without overshadowing the broader discussion of symptoms and concerns.
- The summary should maintain a neutral tone while ensuring all key experiences, symptoms, and medical interactions are documented accurately.
- The summary should be structured in an optimal way for a psychiatrist to process the information effectively.

---

**Instructions for Analysis and Structuring:**
1. **Determine the Ideal Structure:**
   - Assess whether the content is best presented in a chronological format or a symptom-first approach based on the provided notes.
   - Consider a mix of structured sections (e.g., Symptoms, Impact, Medical History, External Opinions) or a well-organized narrative depending on what makes the most sense for clarity.

2. **Key Content Considerations:**
   - Extract the **most critical takeaways** for the psychiatrist to understand.
   - Ensure all major symptoms and their real-world impact are captured in detail.
   - Differentiate between medical opinions from various professionals where relevant.
   - While past miscommunications with the medical team should be included, they should not dominate the summary—only provide the necessary context to support the broader assessment.
   - If applicable, include a section outlining past treatments and their outcomes.

3. **Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Include a **TL;DR summary at the top** for quick reference.
   - Use a structured format that is clear and digestible for a psychiatrist.
   - If necessary, incorporate both direct quotes and paraphrased content, choosing the best approach for clarity.

4. **Output Requirements:**
   - Ensure all medical information is treated with the necessary depth and attention to detail.
   - Provide a final summary that can be easily shared with a psychiatrist in a way that they can quickly grasp the patient’s history, current concerns, and the rationale for seeking an external evaluation.
   - Maintain balance in addressing all aspects of the patient’s concerns, ensuring that no single topic (e.g., past miscommunications) disproportionately skews the focus of the summary.

**Content from notes below**


Okay, let's see if this Note taking is actually helpful for our activities.

I'm writing a small transcript. Actually, it won't be so small, but I have just been experiencing quite a few issues, medically speaking, over the last few years, and now it's becoming so big that I think what I need is a way to just document everything that happened, and then figure out if AI can help me summarize all the activities for for a psychiatrist before my evaluation, so to speak. So let's start with the trigger event. So this happened in, I think, August of last year. So August of 2024

there was this one week where, you know, even though I didn't really have a lot of work, so to speak, I ended up spending far too much time completing my work. So what actually should have taken no more than probably eight hours ended up taking about 20 hours in a day,

and as a result, I was only sleeping like two hours every day. So eventually, what happened was, at the end of the week, I was so I had such a bad headache that I just had to go to the doctor, and I explained all my issues. They did, like a thorough analysis. They spend like, 30 minutes or so, and they asked me a whole lot of questions, and at the end, they prescribed a generic Trazodone along with some pain killers, which I took for one week, and the Trazodone helped me sleep. But after the one week, I stopped taking it because I am. I was just worried about, like, the side effects, potential side effects, feeling drowsy and dizzy and whatnot. And my fear was I won't be able to wake up on time in the future. So but one of the main things the doctors told me was try to get a screening for adult ADHD. So, so this was through Kaiser, and so

I went through the evaluation. I had to take a pause from the whole treatment, because I went to India, but I was sort of able to schedule another appointment earlier January when the new enrollment started. Oh yeah. I mean, I just scheduled another like screening this January where, like, one of the evaluators basically asked me a whole bunch of questions, and then they said, Okay, we have you do show symptoms of ADD, not necessarily ADHD, but just attend a lack of attention and focus. And we also discussed a whole bunch of like symptoms that I've been experiencing over the years and how this has basically affected my life,

and they prescribed a sort of plan of action. They said, Okay, we'll take a two step approach. One is like, we help you talk to a therapist, and the other is like, we'll help you set up some kind of appointment with a psychiatrist. Now, the issue was they, for some reason, they also kept indicating that it sounds like you are experiencing a lot of depression and anxiety, which then, which didn't really make sense, because I don't, I didn't feel I was depressed or anxious in any way. I was just

not being able to focus at work. But they said, Okay, we'll, we'll talk to you about, like, depression and anxiety and so, yeah, basically, I explained this to my physician, like, general physician, family doctor, and he said, Okay, it does seem like you do have some kind of symptoms of ADD, but let's wait for the appointment with the psychiatrist, and then let's see what happened, what what the psychiatrist has to say. I also, parallelly, had an appointment with a therapist, so we went through, like, a whole bunch of sort of symptoms, and the therapist basically confirmed that, yeah, you do have some add, add, like, attention deficit disorder, and it's, it seems like it has now grown to a very severe level. And so the therapist said, Okay, I don't think I can help you, but you need to seek out a psychiatrist, and the psychiatrist can help you. You can still continue meeting with me, but it sounds like, I mean, the therapist said, it sounds like I have already, on my end, tried most of the techniques that the therapist would have suggested. So there's not much the therapist can do even after that so, but one thing the therapist did try to tell me was this, this thing where, like Kaiser, for some reason is being extra cautious, and they are doing everything they can to, like, avoid treatments around, add and so a lot of her other patients have tried to go out of network To find a solution. So yeah, so she basically hinted to me that I should I should also start looking at options. And so when I spoke to the therapist, my appointment with the psychiatrist was within the next two weeks. So between that time, I also saw another psychiatrist. His name was Dr Carl aksinger, but and he actually prescribed Adderall to me. So he said, he said he'd be, he'll be prescribing a general Adderall, generic Adderall. So that was his specification around the dosage, and he said that I should take it once in the morning and once in the afternoon, around 2pm but I for a multitude of reasons, I was just a little skeptic of Dr Karl aksinger,

mainly because I just felt like he didn't ask enough questions. Maybe he did, I don't know. Maybe he did. I was just, I'm just generally cautious, so I didn't start taking any medication at that time.

Yeah, so then when I met with the psychiatrist at Kaiser, that's when I sort of realized, like, this is probably not going to work out in the long run. So as soon as I remember that the session with the psychiatrist was actually very unproductive, because the moment I stepped in, she she basically she started by saying, Okay, what brought you here? And then I started explaining my symptoms. Before I could finish, she just taught me right there, and she said, Look, we're not just so, you know, we're not going to talk about Edd, we're only going to talk about your depression and anxiety.

And it was a little off for me because I didn't know what to say. Because, like, I said, I don't actually think I'm experiencing like, depression and anxiety, but she kept stressing on it, and even within the first, like 15 minutes, as she continued asking questions about like symptoms and what the problems are like within the first 15 minutes, she just said, okay, look, if we, if you don't talk about your depression and anxiety like, then we're going to be at a standstill, because I'm not going to talk to you about add So I had to basically tell her that, okay, for the sake of this discussion, let's just pretend there's no such thing as add. Can you just, like, try to ask me more specific questions, because I don't know what you're looking from from me. So please ask me some specific questions, and I'll see how I can answer them to the best of my abilities. And after like, a whole two hour conversation, she basically, like, couldn't really find any hints around depression and anxiety, but she was also, like, almost, almost in a rude way, dismissive of most of my symptoms, like, I kept explaining to her, like, you know, because of these issues I've I've had, like, very serious issues and fights with my family and my parents, even when I was a kid. And instead of, like, trying to understand it better, she just dismissed it by saying, oh, yeah, but kids fight with their parents all the time. That's not really new,

and she was going on these very random tangents, like she said, I should get my cholesterol checked before I could do any psych evaluation. She prescribed a test for sleep apnea, and you know, there was this one point within the interview or screening where I just mentioned that, you know, sometimes when I phase out, it I can sometimes phase out while climbing down the stairs. So there have been moments where I sometimes, like, accidentally skip a step, so and then she assumed it as saying that I keep falling down the stairs. And trying to clarify to her, like, No, I'm not falling down the stairs, but yeah, there's when I sort of phase out, it, of course, causes like a slight miscoordination, like I've never had any fatalities, nor I don't, I don't think I even will have any fatalities, but almost in a very odd way, she kept repeating the same sentence like four times. She said, if you are falling down the stairs, you need to see a neurologist. If you are falling down the stairs, you need to see a neurologist. So that was a rather and she just wrapped it up as soon as she said, Okay, your next step should be seeing a neurologist. And she basically said, You're not forgetful. You're just experiencing seizures, and the whole experience was rather surreal. So, so yeah, then I started recollecting exactly what my therapist said, which was like, okay, Kaiser seems to be deliberately not trying to address these issues, so the best way for me to move forward is to find some help outside the network. And of course, like I mentioned, I wasn't. I was a little skeptic about Carl, a singer's description as well, because I understand some of the risks of the medication that he described. But yeah, I just decided that I basically need a lot of help to figure out what exactly the problem is. So so, yeah, so far, what I've done is I have outlined the events of the last few months. I've outlined the events, but now I'll try to sort of dig deeper into the symptoms, right? So talking about the symptoms? Yes, I, even though I realized it later in life, maybe I should have, like, realized it a little earlier, but yeah, I was actually considered very forgetful, even as a kid, like from a very young age, I was actually considered very forgetful with my family. Yeah. So the fights which I mentioned earlier that I used to have were basically like, you know how sometimes parents would send their kids to grocery stores and they'll, like, properly explain it, explain what to get. And oftentimes I would basically phase out as they were explaining something, which, at the time, I used to think that it's just basically laziness. But now, when I look back, I find it very reminiscent of, like, some of the ways I phase out during work related conversations, so and yeah, sometimes my parents, later on, my parents started, like, documenting proof. Like, they will say, Okay, I'm telling you all these things, and I'm writing it down on a paper now, see if you can match the grocery list. And then when I came home and forgot something, they would point out and say, like, hey, we talked about you were supposed to get this. Here's our proof. We have it. And why didn't you get it? There was also a lot of like general forgetfulness. And they would always say, Where is your mind? What are you thinking? Where did you zone out?

This also extended in my social circles. So as as you can imagine, like if someone keeps zoning out while they are having a conversation with someone, a friend or a colleague, it does come across as weird. And so there were the more polite people who I think they noticed it, but they didn't. They never really like pointed it out. They just sort of moved on to the next friend or the next colleague, but, but it was actually thanks to some of the mean kids that I actually realized that this was happening. So essentially, what would happen is, as someone is talking to me, I would halfway through a conversation, I would just like phase out so

and and they would notice it. But from their point of view, all they thought, all they assumed, was I wasn't interested enough in the conversation which there might be some fact to it. There could be things that I'm less interested in, but yeah, the fact that it happens so often and across different people, like with family, friends, with colleagues, with everyone this. This was sort of a recurring theme. And like, I remember at least by 12, my my grades started dropping consistently. Like, I think by the time I was 12, I think I was scoring around 80% and then as I moved along, by the time I reached, you know, the 12 standard, my grades were basically 62% right? So I um,

so that happened. I think we've discussed childhood,

and yeah, this, this feeling of like not being able to study is the main reason why I'm I didn't become an engineer like my whole family. My plan from the beginning was to try and be an engineer, but I realized very soon that, you know, book studies is not my thing, and maybe the there's some truth to it. Maybe it's not like an EDD condition, but maybe there's some truth to it. But yeah, there is, there is a slight possibility that I only picked architecture because I realized that I couldn't, like, memorize things, or I couldn't pay attention or focus. Yeah. So this thing about phasing out is something I really realized that that was more pointed out to me when I was in college. So

I was, I was actually really good at the subjects like architectural design, which is not just creative work, it's it also involves a lot of analytical thinking, and like practical knowledge, and I was still good at a lot of those things. In fact, I would say I was excellent. But even in subjects like building constructions and structural calculations, I was I was actually consistently failing, like I would get the I would be asked to repeat exams over and over again. I even, like, had to spend six years instead of five years to complete my architectural program and so, and that's also where, like, I realized there's probably something wrong, because what would happen is a lot of my friends would just, they would basically not, not in a in a malice way, but they would just ask me, like, Hey,

what are you what exactly are you doing with all your time? Because the thing is, I wasn't really attending classes, not because I didn't want to, but because I would like start doing something, start getting ready, and then something will happen, and then I would stop going to a classroom. So I was basically just late, very late, for a lot of my classes. So my friends would say, hey, what exactly are you doing with your time? It's not like you're finishing assignments on time. It's not like you're hanging out with us. So it's like, what exactly are you doing with your time? And it was the toughest question for me to answer, because I even I didn't fully understand where the time was flying,

so and that sort of repeated. There was, there was only one year where I would say I didn't really experience a lot of that, and I think it was during an internship I did in Bangalore for an architecture firm, I think for a period of about four or five months, I would say I was I it looked optimistic. I was always on time. I always finished my tasks. I was well managed. Everything went absolutely great.

But then after those four months again, things started falling apart, like I started, like, losing sense of time, missing assignments, missing deadlines. There were a lot of times that I had to, like, basically lie about some kind of family issues or things like that, just to get away from assignments.

So that was challenging, and that was all like during undergrad, and then came my master's program. So somehow, despite all the bad grades, I was able to get admission into this college. Because one thing I will admit is that I am, I am actually very good at creative work, and that means, like story writing,

design, rationale, any analytical thinking revolved. That revolves around design and architectural thinking. I'm particularly good at those things. But when it comes to actually executing, that's where things start to fall apart.

During my masters. The same thing happened, but, you know, at at a much extreme level, because during masters, we all do group projects, there's there's very less individual work. It's always like group projects, and that's where, like, I started getting even a bad reputation from my own colleagues, because they would basically say that, Hey, why are you? Why are you taking such a long time for the same tasks when it takes us four hours, or it takes us no more than eight hours? My design director? He once called me into his office and he was like, hey, so let's, let's talk about, like, how you're managing time, and let's, let's figure out some kind of strategy for you. Because even in my masters, I was basically spending about, like, more than half the day, I think I only went home to sleep, but starting from the morning all the way till late night, I was at the studio most of the time alone because no one else was there, but, but, yeah, I just couldn't find myself to get myself to finish any of the work. And I think this sort of characteristic followed me even throughout my professional years. I've been in the same job for since 2000 late, 2019 so you can say since 2020, I've been in the same job, and I haven't really progressed after that. Now, to clarify exactly what happens like, why does it actually take time for me to finish a lot of my work? Let me see if I can accurately describe what happens as a thought process. So,

so the way it works is like I will, I will make a plan, and I will sit down to execute on that plan, and it's just one small thing that happens, one small change or shift or new realization that happens which, which then leads me down this mental rabbit hole where I start doing one thing, and then it turns into something else, and then another thing, and then the third thing, and then the fourth thing. Oftentimes my mind starts wandering in like 50 different directions, sometimes even like causing me a slight headache on my forehead. A

lot of times, like, people will find me just walking around, like, aimlessly walking around continuously, and what's happening during, like, when I'm walking around, I'm basically just my mind is just going into different directions, and it is impossible for me to, like sit in one place and act on any small thought, because the moment I start trying to act on something, I end up just wondering. And so essentially, what could have taken probably 1015 minutes ends up taking 45 minutes to one hour because, like, I keep going on these, like mental journeys every time I try to do anything. And this has happened from undergraduate, sort of May became worse as I went into my master's. Fortunately, I graduated, but even that was on thin ice, because there was this one subject where I basically missed one of the deliverables. So, and that's by the way, when my director called me in and he was like, Hey, I think we should probably talk about, like, how you're managing your time, because there's, I think there's something wrong here. So So luckily, like here, people are more empathetic and sort of here, they try to work with the student, instead of just blaming the student for all the issues. So luckily, I graduated in one year.

But, but yeah, this I will sit in one place, and then my mind would start wandering in different places, and at the end of the day, I won't actually get anything done.

What else? How did I cope with it?

Yeah, I mean, I there were a lot of like resources I tried to find that could help me. So first, I started by trying to understand exactly what procrastination is, because my assumption for a long time was I was just procrastinating and that I was lazy. So

I read somewhere that it's technically not procrastination, unless you're able to get things done,

even if you work till the last moment. So as an experiment, I think in 2021

during when, when the COVID thing was still, when the COVID issue was still a thing. I think that was 2021 for like, four months, I tried this exercise where I would, instead of waking up at the normal business hours, I would actually wake up at 3:30am

make sure I have nothing with me and and my next deliverable would be at 9am which would be the sync up call, where the stand up call, where we basically describe what we have done the previous day. So I would get up at 233, something like that, make my extremely large cup of tea, which is basically like a four cup tea. It's like a tea jug, a small pitcher of tea. Sit, start working. And because there was such a rush, like, Okay, I have to finish everything within four hours, I think that gave me a lot of excitement to actually get things done. It was also rather stressful,

which is one of the reasons why I couldn't sustain it, but also mainly because it was just so odd that in order to wake up at two o'clock, I had to somehow force myself to go to sleep by six o'clock, 6pm at night. So yeah, as you can imagine, that wasn't sustainable. But one thing I realized was,

like a good way to focus is to literally be crunched for time.

But as time moved on, obviously I couldn't like get everything keep pushing everything till the last moment, because it would. Because what I realized was, even if I leave something to the last moment, I find out issues at the last moment, and by that time, it's too late. Like the stakeholders, the clients, the product managers. Everyone is pissed off, like, Hey, Sakshat, why didn't you address that early? So I couldn't sustain that.

Then slowly and steadily, I started building these almost like tools. So for example, I think since halfway through college, like, I think the fourth year or something, I realized that having something playing in the background helps. So for example, it'll be some kind of an episode of Big Bang Theory, or the Two and a Half Men. You know, back in the day, it was big bang theory and Two and a Half Men, and then it changed to different shows. But what I realized was, as long as there's a TV show running in the background, I can, I can at least focus and do my things, and as soon as the TV show is turned off, that's, that's like, the end of it, like, that's when my mind starts wandering to such an extreme level where I start walking around the house for 40 minutes, and then just out of sheer fatigue, I have to sit down and basically take a rest, because my legs have started to kill me by that time. So so now I have like a separate device that is always all the time, just running something, playing something in the background, and doing nothing else. I also now have, like a timer set in every room, whether it's my bedroom. I have two in my bedroom, one in my bathroom and one in the kitchen.

So unless, unless there's some kind of visual representation of how much time is being sent spent, I will halfway through the conversation. I will just halfway through, not just a conversation, but even an activity. Halfway through it, I will just zone out, and that's it. That's the end of the day for me, because after that, it's once, once, one bad thing happens. It's impossible to recover from it, and it's basically the an entire day gone. So and also, to make my life easier, I have basically

started eating the exact same meal every single day, so in breakfast, it's like nuts with yogurt, my four cups of tea in a tea picture, and and, yeah, one boiled egg for lunch, almost regularly, it's a vegetable soup. And for dinner, it's dal bati. And it's not necessarily because I like eating this food, although I do like my dinner. That's my one rule. My dinner has to be something that I really enjoy and basically a comfort food. But yeah, the main reason I eat the exact same meal every day is because if I go off the rail just for one decision again. It's like, the end of the day, I'm never able to finish my work, and it's just impossible. But what I realized, at least within the last couple of years, is two things. One is like, even these mechanisms are not helping me. They can help to a certain degree, but I still find myself losing time. Like, if I am thirsty, for example, I'll walk towards the kitchen. It's basically like four steps, five steps, actually. And by the time I take the second step, I've forgotten that I'm thirsty. And once I forget then I'm just wandering around, like, Okay, what happened? What did they do? What's what went wrong? What am I thinking? What am I doing? And it's just question after question. And then mind starts wandering left and right, and before I know it, it's 3030 minutes have passed, and 30 minutes turns to 45 minutes, and then I'm back to the bed because I'm fatigued. And once I'm fatigued, I then remember that, oh, my original intent was to just go grab some water from the kitchen.

That that's one thing. Another thing is like, by now, my parents have started like pointing it out, so I carry headphones with me. I'm always, always wearing headphones, because if something stops playing, then it's just not good. I just don't trust my own mind anymore. So I always have to put on headphones. My parents have noticed it in the sense that they have noticed quite a few times when I am staring like the water will be boiling, and sometimes I'm just staring at the boiling water, completely zoned out. Someone else will have to come remind me that, hey, Sakshat, something is going on, like, get a grip. What are you doing? My mother is actually the only person who has noticed me talking to myself. And this is, again, one of those things that happens when I when my mind starts wondering, like I will probably imagine some other conversation or something, and my the words would just almost involuntarily start coming out of my mouth, and I have basically lost track of exactly where I am, what time it is, all of that has disappeared, and I'm just like, in a very sort of slightly creepy way,

I start actually moving my hands, talking, moving my legs, and doing all sorts of these things, which you might find probably some drunk person doing, and I don't even drink. I haven't like had any alcohol for the last one year. I

What else? I haven't had any alcohol, but I do have to smoke, not because I want to smoke. I don't actually enjoy smoking. Yeah, I mean, there is a certain fun to it, but I hate how my fingers smell. I The fact that my teeth are turning brown, but I can't stop smoking. I always have to smoke, especially during weekdays. I never need to smoke during weekends, because I don't. I try not to work during weekends, but during weekdays, when I'm working, I always have to smoke. I tried a bunch of things. I tried Nicola nicotine lozenges, which are actually pretty helpful. So there are times when I have to go to India for three months, and this is my only solution, like I just stock up on a whole bunch of lozenges, and that helps, but it's still not as helpful as a cigarette, because the cigarette is quicker. It just like keeps me in one place. There are times when I try to quit both nicotine lozenges and the cigarettes, and what happens is like, again, one of the things I mentioned repeatedly is like my mind starts wandering, and I'm walking all over the house, and it's it's to the point where I am not able to control my own thoughts. And it is exhausting. It actually gives me a degree of headache,

but, yeah, so, so then eventually I have to give in and just go have one cigarette and then go to sleep. I don't

necessarily have trouble sleeping, except for the fact that, yes, like, the fact that all these things are happening to me does stress me out at times. The fact that I spent one whole day daydreaming and not having done anything certainly does cause issues make me stress, because I knew I could have done something, but obviously I didn't, because I was daydreaming the whole day. And it's not even like,

it's not even that I don't like, necessarily enjoy doing what I do. It's just I'm never able to, like, get anything done.

What else?

Yeah, even my my nephew. So even in when I'm in public, I often have to keep some kind of music playing. So it was the last few weeks I've been meeting with my nephew a lot. So, like, he has pointed out to me that, hey, are you? Are you actually listening to some kind of music, and I have to, like, admit to him, yeah, I'm sorry I'm listening. And then I'll just pause it for a few minutes, but then I always have to start it back. So my sister phrased it like, you always have two streams running in your mind, you always seem to have two screens running, which I guess is a fairly accurate way of putting it like, unless I have these two screens running, I can't do one.

Yeah, and the thing about like from the stairs, so yeah, there are times when I zone out, but not necessarily on stairs alone. It's just It happens all throughout like I might be walking or going to the grocery store, and halfway through the walk, I will forget exactly why I was doing, why I was going to the grocery store, or it might happen that I might I'll, like, take a few steps and then realize I'm in a completely different place.

And, yeah, for a very, very long time, I just thought that, you know, this is just basically laziness, but after like talking to first the doctor to whom I described all these symptoms, and then to the initial evaluator for add my therapist and the other psychiatrist,

and just like, feedback from my own family, like the fact that they're all pointing out and saying that, you know you shouldn't have a timer in every room,

and like, you shouldn't, we shouldn't have to, like, constantly remind you of what's going on there. Has there are so many times when, like, I will be doing one thing, and my mom will notice that almost seamlessly, I will transition into something else without, like, having any sense of what I was doing. Just the other day, I was doing one thing, it turned into another thing. And then I went to the bathroom, and as soon as I came out, I actually, I was, I was actually stressed and kind of embarrassed because I didn't I had no clue what exactly I was doing. And my mom, she realized that, okay, I'm sort of lost. And she had to basically remind me that, hey, by the way, you were doing something on the laptop. It was a yellow color screen. So yeah, so now you can probably get back to doing that. And, like, those kinds of things are pretty, pretty embarrassing to say the least.

The other day, I also, like, cut my finger, and it's weird because it's it happened in the kitchen when I was peeling ginger for my tea. And the reason it's particularly strange is because I know I was distracted. I know I was thinking about something else. But the reason it's concerning is like the knife cut the tip of my index finger of my right hand, which actually makes no sense, because there's no angle. I'm fairly good at cooking, and there's no angle. There's no position of the knife where the index of your right hand would get cut, and that too, on the top surface, not at the bottom surface. So it's completely impossible, but yeah, these sort of things keep happening to me.

And yeah, and I guess I just basically need some help at this point.

A few more things for the doctors context the reason I approached this doctor was I I was particularly looking for an Indian doctor because one thing I noticed in some of my past interactions is that the fact that there's there's a lot of cultural nuances that are very hard for others to understand like the fact that my parents didn't really see it as a medical issue now I was in India, so and then we come from a very a fairly lower middle income class so it's not like my parents didn't pay attention or they just I think at that time they just didn't think it was a medical issue or it was something that needed to be addressed. They kept they did sort of hit me a lot when I was a kid and it was always about these kind of things, but I don't think it was because they were negligent. I think it's just that at the time they didn't really see it as an issue they just kept saying that I'm lazy and I just if I didn't focus a lot they would just smack me on my head and say start focusing and I think that point is is really hard for me to explain and it's also very odd for others to really you know emphasize with another thing that came up was the use of devices so for example I got my first smart phone when I was in my third year of college, which is like the age of 21. It's also when I got my first laptop so like this again is something that's very hard to explain to like psychiatrists here or therapist even for that matter like the fact that I didn't use devices from childhood I mean it doesn't make sense like the first iPhone came up came out in 2007. I graduated from school by 2010 and it's like it's obvious that you know at least by 2011 or 12 the whole smartphone boom was not that prevalent even in India, so that I think is sometimes challenging for me to clearly explain and so at least in my last session this became like a sort of point of friction like she didn't believe me she simply didn't believe me when I said I didn't have devices until like 20 or 21 years old.

**TL;DR Summary:**
Patient is seeking an external ADD evaluation due to longstanding and escalating attention/focus difficulties that have significantly impacted academic, professional, and daily functioning. Multiple evaluations have noted symptoms consistent with ADD/ADHD, though there’s been conflicting emphasis on depression and anxiety. The patient also describes persistent forgetfulness, zoning out, time mismanagement, and compensatory coping strategies, with a history of miscommunications with previous providers. Cultural and familial factors further complicate understanding and addressing these issues.

---

**1. Background & Trigger Event**
- **Initial Incident:**
  - In August 2024, during a week of extreme overwork (20-hour days with only 2 hours of sleep), the patient developed a severe headache and sought medical help.
  - Prescribed generic Trazodone (for sleep) and painkillers, taken for one week before discontinuing due to concerns about side effects.

- **Recommendation:**
  - The attending doctor at Kaiser advised screening for adult ADHD as a contributing factor.

---

**2. Medical Evaluations & Interactions**
- **Kaiser Evaluation (January 2024 Enrollment):**
  - A screening indicated signs of ADD (characterized by lack of attention and focus) but also repeatedly mentioned symptoms of depression and anxiety.
  - The evaluation session was unproductive; the psychiatrist redirected the focus toward depression/anxiety despite the patient’s insistence on discussing ADD-related symptoms.
  - Additional tests were suggested (e.g., cholesterol check, sleep apnea screening) and there were repeated recommendations to see a neurologist based on misinterpreted symptoms.

- **Parallel Evaluations:**
  - **Therapist:**
    - Confirmed longstanding attention deficit issues and noted that traditional therapeutic techniques had been largely exhausted.
    - Highlighted that many patients, including the patient, have sought out-of-network help due to Kaiser’s cautious approach.
  - **External Psychiatrist (Dr. Carl Aksinger):**
    - Prescribed generic Adderall with a dosing schedule (morning and early afternoon), but the patient hesitated due to feeling that the evaluation was cursory.

**3. Symptom Profile & Daily Impact**
- **Cognitive & Behavioral Symptoms:**
  - **Persistent Inattention:**
    - Chronic forgetfulness dating back to childhood (difficulty following instructions, zoning out during conversations).
    - Frequent "phasing out" during activities, causing miscoordination (e.g., nearly falling on stairs, accidental finger cuts).
  - **Time Management Challenges:**
    - Difficulty maintaining focus results in significant delays (tasks taking far longer than necessary due to mental “rabbit holes”).
    - Experiences severe disruptions in academic and work settings, with repeated missed deadlines and incomplete tasks.
  - **Mind Wandering:**
    - Describes a “dual screen” experience: constant background noise (TV or headphones) is needed to maintain focus.
    - Tendency to become so absorbed in internal thoughts that external cues (e.g., hunger, thirst) are ignored.

- **Emotional & Social Effects:**
  - Feelings of frustration and embarrassment due to inability to complete tasks or follow conversations.
  - Negative social feedback from peers and family, often being labeled as “lazy” or inattentive.
  - Occasional stress and anxiety stemming from the awareness of lost time and unmet responsibilities.

- **Physical & Lifestyle Implications:**
  - Altered daily routines (e.g., eating the same meals, strict reliance on timers in different rooms).
  - Compensatory behaviors include using music constantly and carrying headphones in public to mitigate distraction.
  - Smoking remains a coping mechanism despite awareness of its negative effects.

---

**4. Coping Strategies & Adaptive Mechanisms**
- **Self-Experimentation:**
  - Attempted early morning work sessions during the COVID period, which provided temporary focus under time pressure but was unsustainable.
- **Environmental Modifications:**
  - Uses background TV/audio to maintain a level of constant external stimulation.
  - Relies on timers in various rooms to provide a visual representation of time passing.
- **Routine Adjustments:**
  - Maintains a strict dietary routine to limit decision fatigue, though this is only partially effective.
- **Family & Social Feedback:**
  - Family members have noted instances of aimless wandering and even talking to oneself, reinforcing the patient’s awareness of the severity of the inattention.

---

**5. Cultural & Familial Considerations**
- **Cultural Nuances:**
  - The patient’s Indian background and lower-middle-income upbringing influence family perceptions of attention issues, often being dismissed as laziness.
  - Preference for an Indian doctor is partly due to cultural understanding, as previous interactions with non-Indian providers have led to miscommunications regarding symptoms.
- **Device Usage History:**
  - Noted minimal exposure to smartphones and laptops during childhood, which contrasts with typical exposure patterns; this detail has occasionally led to skepticism from providers when explained.

---

**6. Current Concerns & Next Steps**
- **Primary Request:**
  - Seeking an accurate, external evaluation focused on ADD/ADHD symptoms, without conflating them with depression/anxiety.
- **Desired Outcome:**
  - A comprehensive review that considers lifelong patterns of inattention and the subsequent impact on academic, professional, and personal life.
  - Guidance on appropriate pharmacological and behavioral interventions given the history of misdiagnoses and unsatisfactory previous evaluations.

---

**Summary Conclusion:**
The patient presents with a longstanding history of attention and focus deficits, manifesting as chronic forgetfulness, frequent zoning out, and significant time management challenges that have adversely affected multiple areas of life. Despite multiple evaluations and interventions, there is ongoing uncertainty regarding the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The patient is now actively seeking an external, culturally attuned psychiatric evaluation to address these concerns without the confounding focus on depression and anxiety, aiming to develop a treatment plan that addresses the core ADD/ADHD symptoms.

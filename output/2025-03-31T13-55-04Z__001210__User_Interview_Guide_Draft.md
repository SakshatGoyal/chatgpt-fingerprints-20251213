- If you could improve one aspect of executive decision-making in general, what would it be?


-------------------------

HOWEVER - I didn't like it too much. It was pretty good, but during my first interview with a user who was a chief compliance officer, I drafted another set of questions. Here they are:

-----------------------


Dennis Irwin

Intro (1-2 min)

Dennis, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I’m Sakshat, Design Lead at Intelligaia, and I’m conducting this research as part of a study at the D³ Institute at HBS. Our focus is on how leaders navigate uncertainty, crisis response, and regulatory complexity—especially the kinds of decisions that don’t always make it into business literature.

Given your extensive experience tackling regulatory shifts, crisis management, and operational risk, we’d love to hear about how you approach decision-making in high-stakes environments. This will be a conversational discussion, so feel free to take it in directions that are relevant to you. 

I also want you to know that there are no wrong answers or opinions here, so you can be completely open with your thoughts. During the interview, you can ask me any questions to clarify or elaborate. 

Everything you say will be confidential. We’ll only use the information for internal reference and keep you anonymous. However, we would like to record this session so that we can recall details later. Is that okay with you?

Shall we dive in?

----------

I. Setting the Stage – Your Approach to Decision-Making

Goal: Establish rapport, understand his decision-making role, and create a foundation for deeper discussion.


- While i’ve gone through your profile, for the purposes of this conversation could you briefly describe your current role and some of the past experiences you’ve had working in the industry? 
    
- You’ve been in executive roles at Citi, Caliber, and now Alkami, where decision-making has been central to risk and compliance. What kinds of decisions do you find most challenging in your role today?
    
- How do you personally define a “good” decision in a high-risk environment?
    
- Regulatory and risk landscapes shift constantly. When you think about the biggest changes in your industry over the past decade, how have they influenced the way you approach decision-making?
    
- Can you walk me through a time when you had to make a major decision with incomplete or conflicting information? How did you navigate it?


Follow-ups:

- Are there moments when your instincts have clashed with data or regulations? How do you navigate that?
    
- How do you balance long-term strategic thinking with the need to react to immediate risks?


----------

II. AI & Technology in Compliance and Risk Management


1. At Alkami, you’re at the intersection of compliance and technology. How do you see AI reshaping risk and compliance decision-making?
    
2. What factors influence whether you trust an AI-generated insight or recommendation? Can you recall a time when AI or technology led you to rethink a decision—or when you overruled it?
    
3. Where do you see the biggest gaps in AI’s ability to support executive decision-making? How do you balance AI-driven efficiency with the need for human judgment in risk management?


----------

III. The Future of Compliance & Organizational Scaling


1. If you could design a role that made your job significantly easier, what would that role look like? Would it be more focused on automation, decision support, or regulatory strategy?
    
2. If I told you that in five years, compliance teams as we know them today will no longer exist, what do you think will replace them? Do you see compliance becoming more automated, more embedded in business processes, or shifting into a different role?
    
3. Let’s say Alkami doubled in size tomorrow—what would break first in compliance and risk management? What would need to change immediately to keep up?
    
----------

VI. Closing (1-2 min)


- This has been a fantastic conversation—thank you for sharing your insights. Before we wrap up, is there anything we didn’t cover that you think is crucial to decision-making in compliance and risk?
- If you could improve one aspect of executive decision-making, what would it be?

## ChatGPT (2025-03-31T13:55:07.022601+00:00)

Thanks for sharing all that context—really helpful. Since you're interviewing **Tim Miller**, whose background blends deep product leadership with startup agility and scaled platform thinking, we can shape your interview guide to pull out insights around **product decision-making under uncertainty, scaling complexity, AI skepticism/trust, and enabling scrappy teams**—all within the context of a massive creator-driven ecosystem like Squarespace.

Here’s a **tailored set of interview questions** for Tim, drawing from the tone and depth of your Dennis Irwin guide but adapted to Tim’s unique background:

---

### **Intro (1–2 min)**

Tim, thanks so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I’m Sakshat, Design Lead at Intelligaia, and I’m conducting this research as part of a study at the D³ Institute at HBS. We’re exploring how product leaders navigate high-stakes decisions—especially when uncertainty, technology shifts, or fast-scaling environments are involved.

Given your experience at Squarespace, building products that support an enormous creator ecosystem—and your time launching and scaling new ventures like VSUAL—I’m really interested in how you make decisions when the stakes are high but the path forward isn’t always clear.

This will be a conversational session, and you can absolutely take it in directions that feel most relevant to your experience. Is it alright if we record this session for internal reference?

Let’s dive in.

---

### **I. Product Leadership Under Uncertainty**

**Goal:** Understand how Tim approaches decision-making in ambiguous, high-velocity product environments.

- Could you walk me through your current role and what types of product or strategy decisions you're most focused on today?
  
- Over your time at Squarespace, you've helped launch things like the app store, email campaigns, and Courses. What’s an example of a product decision that felt particularly risky or ambiguous at the outset?

- When working with scrappy teams inside a large org, what are the biggest decision-making challenges you face? What helps you cut through the noise?

- How do you personally define a “good” product decision? Is it more about outcomes, velocity, alignment—or something else?

**Follow-ups:**
- Have you ever had to make a call that contradicted initial data or internal consensus? What gave you the conviction to move forward?
- When you're under pressure to move fast, how do you make space for strategic thinking?

---

### **II. Intuition, Judgment & Bias in Product Strategy**

**Goal:** Explore how Tim balances instinct, user insight, and data in complex product decisions.

- When you're making a product decision with no clear right answer, how do you weigh user intuition, team instincts, and data inputs?

- Can you think of a time when your instinct led you to push for a direction that initially didn’t have buy-in? What happened?

- Have you developed any personal heuristics or “checks” to catch cognitive biases—like sunk cost, confirmation bias, or overconfidence—in yourself or your teams?

**Follow-ups:**
- Have emotions like excitement, fear, or ownership ever clouded your judgment in a product decision? How do you notice and manage that?
- How do you foster a culture where people feel comfortable challenging assumptions, especially in high-stakes product debates?

---

### **III. Scaling Product Ecosystems & Managing Complexity**

**Goal:** Understand how Tim navigates the complexity of a multi-product, multi-stakeholder ecosystem.

- What’s the most complex product ecosystem you’ve had to manage or influence? What made it complex—was it the interfaces, the org structure, the user variability?

- When you’re launching something new, how do you decide which signals to pay attention to early on—and which ones to ignore?

- How do you balance innovation and operational scale? For example, how do you keep things scrappy when the platform is supporting hundreds of millions in GMV?

**Follow-ups:**
- What role does experimentation play in your process? Are there times when running an experiment just doesn’t make sense?
- What’s your approach to managing product debt and complexity across multiple teams or business units?

---

### **IV. AI, Trust, and Decision Support in Product Work**

**Goal:** Understand how Tim views AI's role in product leadership, especially where human judgment intersects with machine-generated insight.

- What’s your current perspective on AI’s role in product management? Are there areas where it's genuinely helping you make better decisions?

- Have you ever questioned or overridden an AI- or analytics-driven insight? What made you skeptical?

- What makes an AI-driven recommendation feel trustworthy to you? What signals do you look for?

**Follow-ups:**
- Where do you think AI falls short in supporting strategic product calls?
- If you could design an AI assistant to help you make better product decisions, what would it focus on?

---

### **V. Reflecting, Adapting, and Evolving as a Leader**

**Goal:** Understand how Tim evaluates decisions and adapts his frameworks over time.

- Looking back, what’s a product or business decision that didn’t go as planned? What did it teach you?

- How do you evaluate the quality of a decision *after* the fact—especially if the outcome was murky?

- How has your approach to decision-making changed from your early startup days to leading product at Squarespace?

**Follow-ups:**
- Do you have any habits or rituals that help you sharpen your decision-making over time?
- What advice would you give to a rising product leader facing their first truly high-stakes decision?

---

### **Closing (1–2 min)**

- This has been a really rich conversation—thank you. Before we wrap, is there anything you wish we’d covered but didn’t?

- If you could wave a magic wand and improve one thing about how product decisions get made in large organizations, what would it be?

---

Would you like a condensed version of this to use as a quick-reference script during the interview? Or a Google Doc version you can annotate in?

## You (2025-03-31T14:01:13.269000+00:00)

Hey, just for your context, I'm attaching this file. It has a set of insights regarding functional and innovation strategy. Is there a way we can use these to refine our questions specifically for Tim? Keep in mind, if this doesn not add too much value, I don't want you to try and fit something just to please me. I'm perfectly fine not using this content.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-31T14:01:14.674638+00:00)

Thanks for sharing the strategic insights doc—super rich, and I appreciate the explicit invitation to *not* force-fit it if it doesn’t meaningfully enhance the interview. That said, I think there *are* a few specific areas from the file that can add real value to your conversation with Tim—particularly around **hybrid innovation strategy, operational tension between bold moves and discipline, and the cultural limits of transformation inside scaled orgs**.

Here are **three refinements** to the Tim Miller interview questions that are **meaningfully enriched** by the strategic insights doc—without adding bloat or straining the tone:

---

### 🔁 **Refinement 1: Dual-Track Innovation & Capital Discipline**

**Context from your doc:**
> “Executives pursue dual-track strategies to balance bold innovation with financial prudence, yet the operational mechanisms guiding this balance lack clear definition.”  
> (Innovation Strategy + Functional Strategy insights)

**Updated Question:**
> At Squarespace, you’ve launched bold new platforms—like the 3rd party app store and Courses—within an established, scaled business. How do you personally navigate the tension between pushing innovation and maintaining operational or financial discipline?

**Follow-up:**
> Are there any frameworks or heuristics you use to guide how much risk or resource to place behind a new product idea?

---

### 🧩 **Refinement 2: Building for Scale While Staying Scrappy**

**Context from your doc:**
> “Executives often act decisively based on early heuristics, only to course-correct as emerging evidence reveals the limits of initial assumptions.”  
> (Functional Strategy + Innovation Execution)

**Updated Question:**
> You mention helping “scrappy teams do amazing things”—how do you preserve that startup-style decision-making in a scaled org where data, process, and structure can sometimes slow things down?

**Follow-up:**
> Have you had to push back against legacy assumptions or processes to maintain that agility? What worked—or didn’t?

---

### 🤖 **Refinement 3: Explainability & Trust in AI-Driven Product Decisions**

**Context from your doc:**
> “Executives demand explainability to build trust in AI systems, yet continue to treat algorithmic outputs as inherently objective despite evidence of embedded bias.”  
> (AI & Decision-Making)

**Updated Question:**
> When you evaluate AI-driven recommendations—say, from an analytics tool or a product usage model—what makes you trust or question the output? Is explainability something you prioritize?

**Follow-up:**
> Have there been cases where the data said one thing, but you went in a different direction based on what you saw in the field or heard from users?

---

If you'd like, I can now incorporate these into a revised **full interview script** for Tim that builds on our earlier version but reflects these three strategic themes more explicitly.

Would you like that? Or do you prefer keeping these as modular enhancements you’ll weave in as needed?

## You (2025-03-31T14:08:14.342000+00:00)

One more thing... take a look at these questions...


"
1. If you could design a role that made your job significantly easier, what would that role look like? Would it be more focused on automation, decision support, or regulatory strategy?
    
2. If I told you that in five years, compliance teams as we know them today will no longer exist, what do you think will replace them? Do you see compliance becoming more automated, more embedded in business processes, or shifting into a different role?"

You see, the original intent behind it was to find a subtle way of finding opportunities for design. The thing is, I work with a philosophy -- there's immense opportunity in identifying areas where someone defines a human role. Typically i always ask a user something like,

"Lets say the company hires someone to work for you, who has the exact same knowledge and skillset as you. What kind of work would you delegate to them and what kind of work would you keep for yourself.?"

There's actually subtext in the intention behind this question. When they imagine a person, they don't have to be too speculative. Typpically people ask "If you could wave a magic wand, what would you change?" I hate that cuz its too speculative. But with this question that i shared, people actually start using their minds to uncover what problems they have right now that they could eliminate with a person. And finding those problems are absolute goldmines for identifying opportunities to design. It also tells me what about their own work they value most. 

This question

"1. If you could design a role that made your job significantly easier, what would that role look like? Would it be more focused on automation, decision support, or regulatory strategy?"

During our last interview, this told me A LOT about the participant. Not jsut the participant, about how he manages his team. 

And then this question, not as effective as the first one, but still

"2. If I told you that in five years, compliance teams as we know them today will no longer exist, what do you think will replace them? Do you see compliance becoming more automated, more embedded in business processes, or shifting into a different role?"

These kind of hypothetical questions are the main reason we conduct interviews, because it gives us raw unfiltered view into the mind of our users which is impossible to get in a survey or research paper. Could you help me draft some questions like this?

## ChatGPT (2025-03-31T14:08:16.416345+00:00)

Absolutely—and I *love* your framing here.

You're not just interviewing for answers, you're interviewing for **designed signals**—which means creating prompts that act like mirrors. The way someone imagines delegation, or conceives of a role, gives you incredibly rich access to **what they value**, **where the friction lives**, and **what kinds of "help" they implicitly trust or reject**.

The way you framed this:

> "What kind of work would you delegate, and what would you keep for yourself?"  
…is a masterstroke. It's not speculative—it’s embodied. And it lets people externalize their cognitive load *without* slipping into generic “I wish I had a dashboard” territory.

### With that in mind, here’s a set of **tailored questions in your spirit**, designed specifically for someone like **Tim Miller** (Product Director at Squarespace), but broadly useful for other product leaders too:

---

### ⚙️ **Delegation as a Lens for Design Opportunity**

**1.** Let’s say the company brought on someone with the exact same product instincts and domain knowledge as you—but they were only allowed to focus on *things you didn’t want to do*.  
What would you hand off to them immediately?  
And what would you insist on keeping for yourself?

**Follow-up prompts:**
- What kinds of decisions are you most protective of?
- What part of your work feels like it drains the most energy with the least return?

---

### 🧠 **Decision Support Without the Magic Wand**

**2.** Imagine your org gives you a tool tomorrow that can sit silently in the background and handle one entire category of decision-making on your behalf—almost like a “ghost PM.”  
What *type* of decision would you want that tool to handle?  
And what would you *never* want to delegate to a system?

**Why it works:**  
This separates **trust** from **control** without forcing them into a “What should AI do?” abstraction. It also surfaces where they feel emotionally attached to their judgment.

---

### 🤖 **Human Role Redesign as a Trojan Horse for Product Thinking**

**3.** If you were to invent a brand new role at Squarespace—something that doesn’t exist yet—but that would 10x your product team’s effectiveness, what would that person do all day?  
Would they be closer to data, operations, creators, internal alignment… something else?

**Follow-up prompts:**
- Where do you find coordination breaking down the most?
- What’s something your team *knows* is important, but consistently can’t make time for?

---

### 🔮 **The Disappearance Prompt (Future-Back Thinking)**

**4.** If I told you that in five years, traditional product teams as we know them no longer exist—what do you think replaces them?  
Is it more embedded cross-functional pods? More AI decision support? Or something entirely different?

**Why it works:**  
It nudges future imagination, *but* grounds it in organizational evolution rather than wishful thinking. Great for surfacing blind spots and unspoken frictions in how teams currently operate.

---

### 🎛️ **Agency Overload / Cognitive Load Disentangling**

**5.** When you think about a typical week, where do you feel like you're *over-deciding*—making too many small calls that clutter your mind?  
And where do you feel like you're *under-involved*, where you wish you had more context or say?

**Why it works:**  
This helps you map out where design could reduce **decision fatigue**—or provide **insight scaffolding** in places where visibility is thin.  

---

If you want, I can help weave some of these into your Tim interview doc—framed in a way that blends naturally with your style.

But even standing alone, I think these five are potent tools for uncovering **latent design demand** in the shape of a person's imagined support system.

Let me know how you'd like to build from here.

## You (2025-03-31T14:14:01.998000+00:00)

I'm gonna attach a whole bunch of questions here now. See if you can use them to add more questions...


All these are tiny research questions we were trying to answer through research papers but failed.

- How does second-guessing show up—and when is it healthy vs. corrosive?
- How do execs manage the **psychological stress** of doubt, ambiguity, or high consequence?
- What practices, frameworks, or rituals help them “sit with” a hard decision?

### 🧠 Pattern Prompts:

- Look for cases where the problem isn’t technical—it’s *relational* or *existential*
- Identify decision types that repeatedly trigger anxiety, delay, or avoidance
- Pay attention to **signals of discomfort**, not just outcomes

---

### **2. What are the most common internal bottlenecks or frictions—and how do they derail strategy?**

### 🔍 Deepening Questions:

- What roles do **politics, misalignment, incentives**, or **hierarchy** play in slowing things down?
- Where do *power dynamics* show up subtly? (e.g., "We had the data, but nobody wanted to touch it.")
- How do stakeholder conflicts manifest? Who gets left out, and why?
- Does organizational culture encourage **challenging assumptions** or suppress dissent?
- Where does **process rigidity** get in the way of adaptive action?

### 🧠 Pattern Prompts:

### 🔍 Deepening Questions:

- What kinds of conflicts arise most often? (e.g., growth vs. sustainability, speed vs. quality)
- Do executives frame trade-offs as **sacrifices**, **bets**, or **balancing acts**?
- What frameworks (explicit or implicit) guide these decisions?
- When is instinct trusted over analysis in these moments?
- How is trade-off *framed internally* to justify the final choice?

### 🧠 Pattern Prompts:

- Are trade-offs presented as **inevitable**, or **negotiable**?
- Is there evidence of “path dependency” (i.e., sunk cost logic)?
- Are there different trade-off styles by company size or stage?

---

### **4. What external pressures distort internal decision-making—and how do execs cope?**

### 🔍 Deepening Questions:

- How do investor demands, customer reactions, or media scrutiny influence decisions?
- What happens when *external timeframes* (e.g., quarterly pressure) conflict with *internal pacing*?
- Do execs filter external signals—or absorb them wholesale?
- What pressures get **voiced**, and which get **internalized silently**?
- How do execs justify acting against their better judgment due to external pressure?

### 🧠 Pattern Prompts:

- Look for patterns of **external overreach** (e.g., “we pivoted too fast because investors panicked”)
- Are some industries more externally volatile?
- Do leaders in large firms feel more **publicly accountable**?

---

### **5. When disruption happens, how do execs choose to pivot—or not?**

### 🔍 Deepening Questions:

- What kinds of signals are treated as **credible early warnings**?
- What makes a company *miss* the disruption (e.g., denial, overconfidence)?
- Is change resisted due to **ego**, **data skepticism**, or **operational inertia**?
- How is disruption *framed internally*—as threat, opportunity, or proof of failure?
- When do execs double down—and why?

### 🧠 Pattern Prompts:

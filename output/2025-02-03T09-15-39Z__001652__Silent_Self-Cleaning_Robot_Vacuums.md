I need one of those automatic floor cleaning robots. but I need a silent one. I don't have a huge house, but whatever it is I want the house to be cleaned everyday. I also work at home and I need to focus so I need the machine to be silent. I hate noisy machines. Oh, and the machine should be self cleaning. Meaning, the pads the machine uses to clean the floor should be cleaned by the machine only.

# Korean Fantasy Movies Dubs

## You (2025-04-30T01:22:13.473792+00:00)

Let me search for Korean fantasy movies on Netflix that have an English dubbed version.

Please only suggest Korean movies dubbed in English. I can't watch them without them.

You don't need to create a table in your response, but I do need the name of the movie, the year, and a short description of the storyline.

For context, I'm currently traveling in Korea and would like a distraction. I enjoy fantasy movies, especially those that don't require much thinking. I’m open to films with a hint of thriller or drama, and I don't mind any mixing of genres, as long as they include an element of fantasy. I want to ensure I have plenty of options, so please provide as many as you can find. It’s really hard to navigate through Netflix, but just make sure that the movies are from after 2016.

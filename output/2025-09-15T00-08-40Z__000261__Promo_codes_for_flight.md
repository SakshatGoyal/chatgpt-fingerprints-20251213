# Promo codes for flight

## You (2025-09-15T00:08:40.390000+00:00)

I’m booking a flight from San Francisco to Hyderabad on the specified date. I’ve attached some details that you can refer to. Could you please help me find all the promo codes available that I can apply on this flight to get a discount? Imagine yourself as a very thrifty and clever traveler who’s determined to find the best possible deal on this flight. Please look through all the available resources to find me this promo code. Sort the promo codes in ascending order based on their recency, so the most recent promo code will be at the top.

Here’s the straight‑up deal hunt for **Air Canada SFO → HYD (Oct 18)**. I checked Air Canada’s current sales, official promo pages, event/partner pages that publish AC codes, and coupon communities that track *live* verifications.

> **Bottom line first:** I couldn’t find any **official, public Air Canada code** that clearly applies to **U.S.→India** cash fares right now. Most current AC codes are market‑ or route‑limited (domestic Canada, Canada↔US/Mexico/Caribbean, or event‑city only). I’m still listing every current, credible code I found **with recency and applicability notes** so you can try the few that have a chance.

## Promo codes (most recent activity at the top)

| Code | What it claims | Where it’s meant to work | Booking/validity notes | Recency (why I trust it) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ACBHKG** | ~10% off (sale code) | Hong Kong‑focused sale; likely HKG routes only (not India) | Community‑verified working in Sept; route/market limits likely | **Seen working Sep 12, 2025** on SimplyCodes (screenshots + activity log).  |
| **PROMOAIR75** | **$75 off** (generic “select items”) | Mixed results; may be region‑limited; sometimes applies to flight bookings | Community shows both successes and failures this week | **Last success Sep 12, 2025** on SimplyCodes; a UAE coupon site lists it **through Sep 25, 2025** (treat as unverified date).  |
| **AC2025CANADA** | **Up to 20% off base fares** | **Canada domestic** and **Canada↔Mexico/Caribbean** seat sale | Not for long‑haul to India or U.S. origins | Officially publicized in AC’s Canada Day/seat‑sale posts; community verified in Aug. **Won’t fit SFO→HYD.**  |
| **TCRKFT91** | ~15% off (sale code) | “Select categories” only; details unclear | Mixed success in user tests; likely market/route constraints | **Last success Aug 21, 2025** per SimplyCodes log; also listed on deal sites.  |

### Event‑/destination‑specific (won’t apply to SFO→HYD, included for completeness)
- **VZ8ZF431** — Federation of Law Societies of Canada annual conference; valid **to/from Winnipeg** only, travel **Oct 7–25, 2025**. (Event code; attendee/destination‑restricted.)
- **U34PXZT1** — Crohn’s & Colitis Canada Meeting of the Minds; valid **to Toronto (YYZ/YTZ)** only, **Nov 3–23, 2025**. (Event code; destination‑restricted.)

### Recently expired (for context; no longer usable)
- **V8U9K3C1** — 30% off domestic sale; required booking by **Jul 31, 2025** (expired).

## What this means for **your** SFO → HYD booking
- **No AC public code right now** explicitly discounts **U.S.→India** cash itineraries. Air Canada’s current headline sale shows **“No promotion code required”** and is targeted at Canada/US/Mexico/Caribbean—not India.
- If you still want to try something, **PROMOAIR75** is the only generic code with **very recent** community success; it may or may not attach to your fare. Try it first; if it rejects, remove it and proceed.
- **Important:** AC promo codes **must be entered at the initial search**, not at payment, and they **don’t apply to existing bookings**. On the homepage, click **“Add promotion code”** under the departure field before searching. (You’re on the Payment step in your screenshot, so you’d need to restart a search to apply one.)

## Why so many codes don’t work on India routes
Air Canada often restricts public codes by **market (which site/currency), origin/destination, cabin, and travel window**. Many current or recent codes (e.g., **AC2025CANADA**) explicitly target **domestic Canada** or **Canada↔Sun** routes, and AC’s own terms note that discounts are on **base fare only** and often exclude codeshares/interline (except AC‑coded United), which your HYD itinerary may include.

## Quick how‑to (2 steps)
1) Go to **aircanada.com** (US/English). On the search panel, click **Add promotion code** and paste a code (try **PROMOAIR75** first).
2) Run the search; if it’s valid you’ll see discounted **base fare** in results. If not, remove the code and re‑search. (Codes can’t be added later.)

### If no code sticks, here are still‑legit savings levers (no codes)
- **AC seat sales without codes** sometimes include U.S. origins, but **India isn’t in the current one**; keep an eye on that sale page through its booking window for changes.
- **Corporate Leisure program** (if you have access through your employer) issues a **personal promo code** by email for leisure travel—fully legitimate but requires eligibility/registration.
- **Event codes** should only be used if you’re eligible and your trip fits the event’s **city & dates**; otherwise they’ll be rejected at search or breach terms.

If you want, I can also sanity‑check your exact SFO→HYD flight numbers for **AC‑operated vs codeshare** (that affects eligibility) and run a couple of **alternative date/airport** checks that sometimes drop the fare more than any code.

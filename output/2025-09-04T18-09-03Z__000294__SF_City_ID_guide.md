Here’s a clean, step-by-step from the official SF.gov page (translated versions load without the site’s robot check):

# How to get a free SF City ID (San Francisco)

**Who qualifies & basics (quick check):** If you live in San Francisco, you can apply regardless of immigration status. The SF City ID is **free** and valid for **2 years**, and it’s recognized by SFPD and other City agencies.

---

## Step 1) Gather proof of **identity** (bring originals)
Bring **one** unexpired original from this list:
- Passport (U.S. or foreign)
- U.S. driver’s license
- U.S. state ID
- Permanent Resident Card (Green Card)
- Consular ID (CID)
- Foreign government photo ID that meets SF Admin Code 95.1(a) requirements

**If you don’t have one of the above:** bring **two** unexpired documents — **one with a photo** (if you’re 14+) and **one showing date of birth**. Accepted examples include: certified birth certificate (U.S. or foreign), military ID (U.S. or foreign), ITIN authorization letter, California school ID, national ID with photo/name/address/DOB/expiry, foreign driver’s license, government-issued visa.

---

## Step 2) Gather proof of **San Francisco residency** (last 30 days)
Bring **one** document with **your name** and **SF address** dated within the **last 30 days**, such as:
- Utility bill (electric, gas, trash, water, internet, cable, phone)
- Bank statement
- Pay stub
- Income-tax or refund statement
- Child’s SF school enrollment record
- Property-tax statement or mortgage receipt
- Rent Board decision
- Jury summons or court order
- Insurance bill (home/renter/health/life/auto)

**If you don’t have these:** a **letter** from a **City-funded homeless shelter** or from a **hospital/clinic/social-service agency** works. If your residency proof is in your **spouse’s** name, bring your **certified marriage certificate**.

---

## Step 3) **Book an appointment**
City ID appointments are booked with the **Office of the County Clerk**.
- Go to **San Francisco City Hall, Room 160**, or
- **Call (415) 554-4816** to schedule.

**Location & hours:** City Hall, **Room 160, 1 Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett Pl., SF 94102**. Processing hours **Mon–Fri, 8:00 am–4:00 pm** (closed public holidays).

---

## Step 4) **Fill out the application**
Download the **PDF application**, fill it out, **print it**, and bring it to your appointment. (There are versions for **14+** and for **13 & under**.)

---

## Step 5) **Go to your appointment (in person)**
At City Hall **Room 160** you will:
- Submit your **completed application**
- Show your **original identity** and **residency** documents
- **Take a photo**
- **Receive your SF City ID before you leave** (appointments are typically ~**30 minutes**)

Hours: **Mon–Fri, 8:00 am–4:00 pm**; closed public holidays.

---

## Special case: **Children 13 and under**
- **Prove the child’s identity:** medical or school record (with EPC stamp), plus one original (e.g., certified birth certificate, Social Security card, current visa, California school ID).
- **Prove the child’s SF residency:** proof of current enrollment in an SF school; if unavailable, you may use the **parent/guardian’s** residency proof.
- **Parent/guardian must attend** the appointment, present their own ID, and **sign** the application (parent info is **not** printed on the child’s card).

---

## What’s on the card & privacy
Your card can show: **name, date of birth, address, signature, photo**, and (optional) **medical conditions/allergies** and an **emergency contact**. The City says the ID **does not show immigration status or gender**, **does not keep copies** of your documents, and keeps only a copy of the **application** (no stored address record). Valid for **2 years**.

---

### Quick bring-list (print this)
- ✅ **Completed, printed application** (14+ or 13 & under)
- ✅ **Identity document(s)** (see Step 1; originals only)
- ✅ **SF residency proof** from the **last 30 days** (see Step 2)

If you want, I can turn this into a one-page checklist you can bring to City Hall.

## ChatGPT (2025-09-04T18:17:39.299070+00:00)

Great! Since you have your Indian passport and a utility bill, you’re all set document-wise.

Here’s the direct link to the official **PDF application form**, for applicants **14 years and older**:

- **SF City ID Card Application (14 & Older)** – This is the official City and County of San Francisco application form in PDF format.

You can download it from the city’s site, fill it out, print it and bring it to your appointment.

---

###  What to Do Next

1. **Download the form** using the link above.
2. **Fill it out** clearly and legibly (English only), including all required fields.
3. **Print** the completed application.
4. **Bring it with your original documents** — your **Indian passport** (as proof of identity) and **recent utility bill** (as proof of SF residency) — to your appointment at City Hall.

Let me know if you’d like help locating the version for applicants **13 and younger**, or if you’d like the list of **everything to bring** laid out as a clean checklist.

## You (2025-09-04T19:30:42.446000+00:00)

do i need to get my own photo or will they be taking a photo of me there?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-04T19:30:43.772092+00:00)

You don’t need to bring your own photo 👍 — they’ll **take your photo at the appointment in City Hall (Room 160)** when you submit your application and documents.

That photo becomes part of your official SF City ID card, which you’ll receive **before you leave** the appointment.

Would you like me to also give you tips on what kind of clothing/background works best for the photo (since it’s similar to a passport/driver’s license photo)?

## You (2025-09-04T19:33:07.955000+00:00)

how likely is it for me to get same day appointment? I tried calling but now i'm thinking I can just go there and they could say, ok - get ready for the photo

## ChatGPT (2025-09-04T19:33:10.307324+00:00)

From the City’s own instructions:

- **Appointments are required** — they don’t take walk-ins for the SF City ID. You’ll need to schedule by phone with the County Clerk’s office at **(415) 554-4950 or (415) 554-4816**.
- **Same-day slots** are sometimes available if someone cancels, but it’s not guaranteed. Calling right when they open (8 am) usually gives you the best chance.
- If you show up without an appointment, staff will usually just ask you to book one rather than processing you on the spot.

So the short version: **you’ll need an appointment**, but if you’re flexible and call early, you may be able to snag a same-day opening.

Do you want me to also check if the County Clerk’s office has an **online booking tool**, so you’re not stuck calling?

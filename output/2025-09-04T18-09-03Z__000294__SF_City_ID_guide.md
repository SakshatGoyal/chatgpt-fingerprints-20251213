Here’s a clean, step-by-step from the official SF.gov page (translated versions load without the site’s robot check):

# How to get a free SF City ID (San Francisco)

**Who qualifies & basics (quick check):** If you live in San Francisco, you can apply regardless of immigration status. The SF City ID is **free** and valid for **2 years**, and it’s recognized by SFPD and other City agencies. citeturn2view0

---

## Step 1) Gather proof of **identity** (bring originals)
Bring **one** unexpired original from this list:
- Passport (U.S. or foreign)
- U.S. driver’s license
- U.S. state ID
- Permanent Resident Card (Green Card)
- Consular ID (CID)
- Foreign government photo ID that meets SF Admin Code 95.1(a) requirements

**If you don’t have one of the above:** bring **two** unexpired documents — **one with a photo** (if you’re 14+) and **one showing date of birth**. Accepted examples include: certified birth certificate (U.S. or foreign), military ID (U.S. or foreign), ITIN authorization letter, California school ID, national ID with photo/name/address/DOB/expiry, foreign driver’s license, government-issued visa. citeturn2view0

---

## Step 2) Gather proof of **San Francisco residency** (last 30 days)
Bring **one** document with **your name** and **SF address** dated within the **last 30 days**, such as:
- Utility bill (electric, gas, trash, water, internet, cable, phone)
- Bank statement
- Pay stub
- Income-tax or refund statement
- Child’s SF school enrollment record
- Property-tax statement or mortgage receipt
- Rent Board decision
- Jury summons or court order
- Insurance bill (home/renter/health/life/auto)

**If you don’t have these:** a **letter** from a **City-funded homeless shelter** or from a **hospital/clinic/social-service agency** works. If your residency proof is in your **spouse’s** name, bring your **certified marriage certificate**. citeturn2view0

---

## Step 3) **Book an appointment**
City ID appointments are booked with the **Office of the County Clerk**.  
- Go to **San Francisco City Hall, Room 160**, or  
- **Call (415) 554-4816** to schedule. citeturn2view0

**Location & hours:** City Hall, **Room 160, 1 Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett Pl., SF 94102**. Processing hours **Mon–Fri, 8:00 am–4:00 pm** (closed public holidays). citeturn4search9

---

## Step 4) **Fill out the application**
Download the **PDF application**, fill it out, **print it**, and bring it to your appointment. (There are versions for **14+** and for **13 & under**.) citeturn2view0turn4search4

---

## Step 5) **Go to your appointment (in person)**
At City Hall **Room 160** you will:
- Submit your **completed application**
- Show your **original identity** and **residency** documents
- **Take a photo**
- **Receive your SF City ID before you leave** (appointments are typically ~**30 minutes**)

Hours: **Mon–Fri, 8:00 am–4:00 pm**; closed public holidays. citeturn2view0turn4search9

---

## Special case: **Children 13 and under**
- **Prove the child’s identity:** medical or school record (with EPC stamp), plus one original (e.g., certified birth certificate, Social Security card, current visa, California school ID).
- **Prove the child’s SF residency:** proof of current enrollment in an SF school; if unavailable, you may use the **parent/guardian’s** residency proof.
- **Parent/guardian must attend** the appointment, present their own ID, and **sign** the application (parent info is **not** printed on the child’s card). citeturn2view0

---

## What’s on the card & privacy
Your card can show: **name, date of birth, address, signature, photo**, and (optional) **medical conditions/allergies** and an **emergency contact**. The City says the ID **does not show immigration status or gender**, **does not keep copies** of your documents, and keeps only a copy of the **application** (no stored address record). Valid for **2 years**. citeturn2view0

### Quick bring-list (print this)
- ✅ **Completed, printed application** (14+ or 13 & under) citeturn2view0turn4search4  
- ✅ **Identity document(s)** (see Step 1; originals only) citeturn2view0  
- ✅ **SF residency proof** from the **last 30 days** (see Step 2) citeturn2view0

If you want, I can turn this into a one-page checklist you can bring to City Hall.

## ChatGPT (2025-09-04T18:17:39.299070+00:00)

Great! Since you have your Indian passport and a utility bill, you’re all set document-wise.

Here’s the direct link to the official **PDF application form**, for applicants **14 years and older**:

- **SF City ID Card Application (14 & Older)** – This is the official City and County of San Francisco application form in PDF format. citeturn0search0

You can download it from the city’s site, fill it out, print it and bring it to your appointment.

---

###  What to Do Next

1. **Download the form** using the link above.
2. **Fill it out** clearly and legibly (English only), including all required fields.
3. **Print** the completed application.
4. **Bring it with your original documents** — your **Indian passport** (as proof of identity) and **recent utility bill** (as proof of SF residency) — to your appointment at City Hall.

Let me know if you’d like help locating the version for applicants **13 and younger**, or if you’d like the list of **everything to bring** laid out as a clean checklist.

## You (2025-09-04T19:30:42.446000+00:00)

do i need to get my own photo or will they be taking a photo of me there?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-04T19:30:43.772092+00:00)

You don’t need to bring your own photo 👍 — they’ll **take your photo at the appointment in City Hall (Room 160)** when you submit your application and documents.  

That photo becomes part of your official SF City ID card, which you’ll receive **before you leave** the appointment.    

Would you like me to also give you tips on what kind of clothing/background works best for the photo (since it’s similar to a passport/driver’s license photo)?

## You (2025-09-04T19:33:07.955000+00:00)

how likely is it for me to get same day appointment? I tried calling but now i'm thinking I can just go there and they could say, ok - get ready for the photo

## ChatGPT (2025-09-04T19:33:10.307324+00:00)

From the City’s own instructions:  

- **Appointments are required** — they don’t take walk-ins for the SF City ID. You’ll need to schedule by phone with the County Clerk’s office at **(415) 554-4950 or (415) 554-4816**.  
- **Same-day slots** are sometimes available if someone cancels, but it’s not guaranteed. Calling right when they open (8 am) usually gives you the best chance.  
- If you show up without an appointment, staff will usually just ask you to book one rather than processing you on the spot.  

So the short version: **you’ll need an appointment**, but if you’re flexible and call early, you may be able to snag a same-day opening.  

Do you want me to also check if the County Clerk’s office has an **online booking tool**, so you’re not stuck calling?

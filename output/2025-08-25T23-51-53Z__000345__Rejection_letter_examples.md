# Rejection letter examples

## You (2025-08-25T23:51:53.843000+00:00)

Help me write a rejection letter for UX design interview candidates. Basically, I want them to know that we've carefully considered their profile and worked through the interview. However, at this moment, we are not moving forward with their application. And it's critical to say at this moment, because we may, at some point, try to reach out to them for something else. But yeah, say that at this moment. Do mention that we've done some careful consideration, because we did interview these candidates along with just reviewing their profile and portfolio. We did spend some time going through their, having a conversation with them. Yeah. And just show me a few different ways you might approach this kind of a letter.

Got it. You want something that strikes the right balance of respect (because they invested real time with you), clarity (not moving forward *now*), and possibility (door open for future opportunities). Let me show you a few different tones and structures you could use — from formal-professional to warm-human.

Hi [Candidate Name],

We’d like to keep the door open and may reach out in the future if another opportunity feels like a stronger match.

### **Option 3: Forward-Looking, Relationship-Oriented**
Subject: Our Interview Process  

Hi [Candidate Name],  

Thank you for spending time with us throughout the interview process. We thoroughly reviewed your profile, your portfolio, and enjoyed the chance to connect with you directly.  

At this moment, we’ve decided not to move forward with your application. We say “at this moment” intentionally, as we recognize that circumstances and opportunities can evolve, and we may reach out again in the future when the timing and role align more closely.  

We’re grateful for the opportunity to get to know you better, and we wish you continued success in your career.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Would you like me to also draft a **super short, one-paragraph version** (sometimes useful for volume rejections), or do you imagine this will mostly be for a smaller number of thoughtfully-considered candidates?

From the meeting transcript, Sakshat Goyal discussed several important design aspects related to a **side panel (drawer) that opens on the right** when a user clicks on an individual row. Here's a structured breakdown of **everything he mentioned specifically about that drawer/side panel**:

---

### 🔓 **Purpose of the Side Panel**
- **Goal:** Provide **detailed insights** into an opportunity **without navigating to another tab**.
- The drawer should open directly from the summary or table view, enhancing continuity of context for the user【5†Meeting started 2025/09/24 03:50 GMT+05:30 - Notes by Gemini.docx†L146-L149】.

### 📋 **Contents of the Drawer**
Sakshat proposed that the side panel should include the following:

1. **Opportunity Summary:**
   - Opportunity name
   - Quote number
   - Amount
   - Days to closing (time remaining)
   - Risk factor **count** and **list** (not just a numeric summary)
   - Stage
   - Products
   - Last activity
   - Subscription end date (for renewal opportunities only)【5†Meeting started 2025/09/24 03:50 GMT+05:30 - Notes by Gemini.docx†L146-L152】.

2. **Account Health Trends:**
   - A **basic trend visualization** for account health status
   - Possibly show **at-risk vs. healthy** over a 12-month trend
   - Could display separate tracks for:
     - Technical health
     - Deployment health
     - Adoption health
   - Might integrate all three if there’s space【5†Meeting started 2025/09/24 03:50 GMT+05:30 - Notes by Gemini.docx†L163-L169】.

3. **AI Prompts / Suggestions:**
   - Located at the **bottom of the panel**
   - Example prompts: "Show me similar opportunities", "Why is this marked critical?", etc.
   - These are designed to make the panel actionable and AI-enhanced【5†Meeting started 2025/09/24 03:50 GMT+05:30 - Notes by Gemini.docx†L152-L153】.

### 🧭 **Interaction & Navigation**
- Users will **click a row**, and instead of navigating to another view, the **drawer will open from the right**, providing contextual details.
- The drawer is designed to support both overview-level decisions and deeper investigation without disrupting user flow.

---

### 🎨 **Visual Design Notes**
- Should include a clear visual layout for the details above
- Could reuse visual components from the summary tiles (e.g., small charts or trend graphs)
- The row that triggers the drawer could include an **AI icon**, similar to what Sakshat proposed for tiles【5†Meeting started 2025/09/24 03:50 GMT+05:30 - Notes by Gemini.docx†L175-L177】.

### 💡 Additional Considerations
- The drawer supports **multiple use cases**, including:
  - Risk assessment
  - Time-based filtering
  - Health-status tracking
- Its inclusion is also aimed at **reducing the need for multiple tabs** or navigation hops
- It forms part of a broader **AI-integrated system** Sakshat envisions, where the AI enhances both summarization and deeper insights【5†Meeting started 2025/09/24 03:50 GMT+05:30 - Notes by Gemini.docx†L177-L179】.

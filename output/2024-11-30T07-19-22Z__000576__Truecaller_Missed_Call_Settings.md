Hey how do I get rid of after call (missed call) details displayed by Truecaller on an Android phone? I checked the settings and it says missed call details will always be displayed regardless of settings but this is too much, it blocks my map screen when I’m driving and it gets very dangerous

I understand that Truecaller's persistent missed call notifications can be disruptive, especially when they interfere with essential applications like maps during driving. Unfortunately, Truecaller has designed the app to always display missed and rejected call details, regardless of user settings. citeturn0search23

However, you can minimize other intrusive notifications by adjusting the following settings:

1. **Disable After-Call Details for Answered Calls**:
   - Open Truecaller and tap the profile icon in the top-left corner.
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Calls**.
   - Enable "Hide for phonebook contacts" to prevent after-call details from appearing for contacts saved in your phonebook.
   - If you're a premium user, you can also enable "Hide for non-phonebook contacts" to suppress after-call details for unknown numbers. citeturn0search21

2. **Turn Off Missed Call Reminders**:
   - In the Truecaller app, go to **Settings** > **General**.
   - Scroll down and disable "Remind me of missed calls" to stop periodic reminders about missed calls. citeturn0search18

3. **Manage Notifications for Blocked Calls and Messages**:
   - Within Truecaller, access **Settings** > **Block**.
   - Toggle off "Notifications for blocked calls and messages" to eliminate alerts from numbers you've blocked. citeturn0search19

These adjustments can help reduce the frequency of disruptive notifications. However, due to the app's design, completely disabling missed call details may not be possible. If this remains a significant issue, you might consider exploring alternative caller ID applications that offer more customizable notification settings.

I’m using an android phone. Is there something I can do as part of android setting to block displaying the missed call details? 

I even turned off all notifications for Truecaller but tht doesn’t affect anything

Truecaller’s missed call details pop-ups are considered "overlay" notifications, which are not affected by turning off regular app notifications. However, on Android, you can control such overlay behavior through the system settings. Here’s what you can do:

### Disable Overlay Permissions for Truecaller
1. **Open Settings** on your Android phone.
2. Navigate to **Apps** or **Apps & Notifications** (depending on your phone model).
3. Find and select **Truecaller** from the list of apps.
4. Go to **Advanced Settings** or **Permissions**.
5. Locate the **Display Over Other Apps** (or **Draw Over Apps**) option.
6. Toggle this setting **off**.

By disabling the "Display Over Other Apps" permission, Truecaller will no longer be able to show pop-ups over other apps, including the missed call details.

---

### Alternative: Use Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode
If the above doesn’t work or you want additional control:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Sound & Vibration** > **Do Not Disturb** (DND).
2. Customize DND settings to block interruptions during specific activities, such as driving or navigating.
3. Ensure DND mode silences or suppresses overlays from apps like Truecaller.

---

If the problem persists after these adjustments, consider temporarily uninstalling Truecaller while driving, especially if it interferes with critical navigation functions.

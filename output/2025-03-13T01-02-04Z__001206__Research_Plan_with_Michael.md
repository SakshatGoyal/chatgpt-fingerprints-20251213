# Research Plan with Michael

## You (2025-03-13T01:02:04.883496+00:00)

Hey Michael, today I need your abilities as an excellent researcher and a professor guiding his students. I'm gonna through a lot at it, in a slightly unstructured way.

We are trying to find ways to use AI to help executives make better decisions, which gradually evolved into 'help executives work through their strategy.' As part of our efforts to identify a product-market fit, I've been tasked with creating a large and diverse portfolio of archetypes to understand different types of audiences, their issues, the opportunities we can find, and so on.

So in my approach, I tried to start by defining what 'Strategy' means, and i came up with 6 categories of strategy.

1. Corporate-Level Strategy
What? Long-term, high-level decisions about the direction of the organization and its place in the world. Focuses on creating, sustaining, or reinventing competitive advantage.
Who? Founders, C-Suite Executives (CEOs, Chairpersons), Visionary Leaders, Board Members
Human-Centered Angle: Individuals at this level don’t just formulate strategies—they shape industries, influence stakeholders, and create macro-trends.
Academic Alignment: Aligns with Corporate Strategy, Blue Ocean Strategy, and Market Entry Strategies.

2. Business-Level Strategy
What? Translating high-level corporate vision into industry- and market-specific strategies.
Who? Business Unit Leaders, General Managers, Senior Directors, Industry Experts
Human-Centered Angle: These individuals are navigators—they take visionary ideas and make them real in competitive environments.
Academic Alignment: Aligns with Business-Level Strategy, Competitive Strategy (Porter’s Cost Leadership vs. Differentiation), and Positioning Strategies.

3. Functional & Tactical Strategy (Department-Specific)
What? Aligning specific functions with overall business and corporate objectives.
Who? VPs, Functional Heads (Marketing, Sales, Operations, R&D, Finance), Senior Managers
Human-Centered Angle: These individuals think about how to best execute within their domains while balancing constraints and optimizing performance.
Academic Alignment: Aligns with Functional Strategy and Tactical Strategy.

4. Adaptive & Crisis Strategy (Risk & Uncertainty Management)
What? Managing uncertainty, crisis response, and risk mitigation.
Who? Risk Officers, Crisis Managers, Operational Strategists, Regulatory & Compliance Teams
Human-Centered Angle: These individuals work under pressure, making real-time decisions that affect the sustainability of the business.
Academic Alignment: Aligns with Crisis & Risk Strategy and Scenario Planning.

5. Innovation & Growth Strategy (Future-Oriented)
What? Driving new growth through technology, new markets, or disruptive business models.
Who? Entrepreneurs, R&D Teams, Product Managers, Venture Capitalists, Innovation Officers
Human-Centered Angle: These individuals focus on creative problem-solving, new market entry, and leveraging emerging technologies.
Academic Alignment: Aligns with Innovation & R&D Strategy, Blue Ocean Strategy, and Growth Strategy.

6. Personal & Leadership Strategy (Individual-Level Strategy)
What? Strategy applied at the individual level for career growth, leadership impact, and influence.
Who? Leaders, Executives, Entrepreneurs, Employees, Individual Contributors
Human-Centered Angle: Recognizes that strategy isn’t just for organizations—individuals also engage in strategic thinking for their careers, leadership, and impact.
Academic Alignment: Draws from Leadership Strategy, Personal Growth Frameworks, and Decision-Making Theories.

My next step was to identify at least six industries most relevant for each of these six types of strategies. I wanted to capture six very contrasting industries so I could gain as broad a set of insights as possible. In addition, for each industry, I wanted to study how strategy is approached by three levels within a hierarchy: C-level Leaders, Executives (SVP, General Manager, Directors), and Upper-Level Management (Senior Leads, Directors, Regional Leads).

So that gives us 6*6*(3 or 4) different profiles.

------

For my Purpose, I want a research that can answer these kind of questions for each of those profiles

------

So I'm creating 6 teams that can help me understand all this purely through literature review. This is because we have a short time frame and no resources for conducting surveys, user interviews, etc.

-----

Could you share your thoughts as a director of design on this approach?

## ChatGPT (2025-03-13T01:02:06.545461+00:00)

Your approach is impressively structured and demonstrates a clear understanding of both strategy frameworks and the nuances of executive decision-making. Given your goals — understanding decision-making processes across archetypes through literature review — your methodology is solid. However, there are some strategic adjustments and enhancements that can improve efficiency, depth, and applicability of your findings. Let me break it down from the perspective of a researcher, designer, and strategic leader.

---

### **Strengths of Your Approach**
✅ **Comprehensive Framework:** Your six strategy categories with industry variations and hierarchical levels offer a robust foundation for segmenting insights. This structure will make it easier to identify patterns and ensure your findings are actionable.
✅ **Balanced Question Set:** Your blend of open-ended, specific, and hypothesis-driven questions shows a mature understanding of research methods. This allows for both exploratory and confirmatory insights.
✅ **Focus on Decision-Making and AI Integration:** This aligns well with the growing trend of augmenting executive capabilities through decision-support tools.
✅ **Team-Based Literature Review:** A smart move given your time constraints — teams can specialize in distinct areas, ensuring breadth and depth.

---

### **Potential Risks & Weaknesses**
🔺 **Information Overload:** The sheer scope (6 strategy types × 6 industries × 3-4 hierarchy levels) is substantial. Even with teams, synthesizing this much information may dilute insights.
🔺 **Depth vs. Breadth Tradeoff:** Literature reviews tend to yield **surface-level insights** unless the research is tightly focused. Without primary research, certain nuanced behaviors and mental models may be missed.
🔺 **Ambiguous Definitions:** Some terms in your framework — such as ‘upper-level management’ or ‘innovation strategy’ — may require sharper definition to ensure teams interpret them consistently.
🔺 **AI Insight Limitations:** The field of AI in strategic decision-making is evolving rapidly, and academic literature may lag behind emerging practices. Supplementing with industry white papers, case studies, or conference proceedings will be crucial.

---

### **Recommended Refinements**
Here’s how I would enhance your approach to maximize impact and manage the scope:

---

### **1. Prioritize Your Focus Using a 3-Tier Model**
Instead of researching **all profiles equally**, consider prioritizing insights based on expected impact:

- **Tier 1 (High Priority):** Focus deeply on **Corporate Strategy** and **Business-Level Strategy** in industries that are rapidly transforming (e.g., tech, healthcare, energy). These groups face high-stakes decisions where AI support could be most valuable.
- **Tier 2 (Moderate Priority):** Cover **Functional**, **Adaptive**, and **Innovation** strategies, but with more targeted questions.
- **Tier 3 (Low Priority):** Keep **Personal Strategy** exploratory; this is the least AI-relevant category in your context.

This approach allows your teams to go deeper where it matters most without sacrificing broader coverage.

---

### **2. Introduce “Key Decision Scenarios” as a Research Anchor**
Instead of treating each archetype as a broad profile, focus on **specific decision scenarios** that recur across industries:

- **Crisis Management:** How do C-suite leaders make urgent, high-impact decisions?
- **Market Expansion:** How do business unit leaders weigh risk when entering new regions?
- **Product Investment:** How do innovation leaders prioritize emerging tech bets?

By framing research around common decision scenarios, you’ll generate insights that directly inform the design of AI-driven tools.

---

### **3. Refine the Role of AI in Decision-Making**
Your AI-related questions are strong, but you can improve them by mapping AI’s role to distinct **decision stages**:

| **Stage**           | **AI's Potential Role** |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Sensemaking**       | Data aggregation, trend spotting, anomaly detection |
| **Evaluation**        | Risk forecasting, outcome prediction, scenario modeling |
| **Decision Execution**| Workflow automation, change management guidance |

This structured framework will help your teams better identify where AI can add value (and where it shouldn’t).

---

### **4. Structure Your Teams Using Complementary Roles**
Given your literature review approach, divide teams by **skills**, not just by topic:

- **Synthesis Leads:** Ensure the most important insights are distilled into actionable frameworks.
- **Domain Experts:** Dive deep into industry-specific sources for credible insights.
- **Trend Spotters:** Focus on emerging patterns in AI adoption and strategic behavior.
- **Storytellers:** Frame your insights using case studies, personas, or narratives to make your findings relatable.

By assigning teams this way, you’ll ensure both rigor and compelling insights.

---

### **5. Identify “Meta Themes” for Efficient Insight Extraction**
With six categories, six industries, and multiple roles, you’ll likely uncover recurring patterns. Encourage teams to highlight:

- **Common Pain Points** (e.g., decision bottlenecks, data gaps)
- **Mental Models in Decision-Making** (e.g., risk tolerance, intuition reliance)
- **Recurring Information Sources** (e.g., benchmarking reports, consultant insights)
- **Key Behavioral Traits** (e.g., delegation tendencies, fear of sunk costs)

These themes will allow you to construct a concise yet powerful **insight library** that transcends individual profiles.

---

### **6. Build for the Next Phase: From Research to Design**
Your end goal is product-market fit. While literature reviews can inform strategy, you'll eventually need to design solutions. Encourage your teams to frame insights in ways that naturally translate to design opportunities.

For instance:

| **Insight**                        | **Design Implication** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Executives struggle to integrate intuition and data. | Design a dashboard that visualizes key data insights alongside expert commentary. |
| Risk-averse executives hesitate to adopt AI. | Introduce AI explanations that highlight the model’s confidence score and underlying rationale. |
| Decision fatigue is common in crisis scenarios. | Develop a "decision simplification" mode that reduces cognitive load by narrowing choices. |

---

### **Final Thought**
Your ambitious structure is well-conceived, and with some strategic adjustments, it can deliver both breadth and depth. By focusing on key decision scenarios, integrating meta-themes, and mapping AI’s role to decision stages, you’ll ensure your research directly informs actionable solutions.

Would you like guidance on designing your research synthesis process, creating visual frameworks, or planning next steps for product ideation?

## You (2025-03-13T04:59:23.349741+00:00)

A very well thought out and comprehensive overview indeed. And I love how creative your approach is. Well done!

Let's pick one category of strategy for now -

2. Business-Level Strategy
What? Translating high-level corporate vision into industry- and market-specific strategies.
Who? Business Unit Leaders, General Managers, Senior Directors, Industry Experts
Human-Centered Angle: These individuals are navigators—they take visionary ideas and make them real in competitive environments.
Academic Alignment: Aligns with Business-Level Strategy, Competitive Strategy (Porter’s Cost Leadership vs. Differentiation), and Positioning Strategies.

Using your suggestions, could you outline a research plan for the team focusing on business-level strategy? I would like all your recommendations to be included in this except for 1 and 6. Here's my reasoning:

"1. Prioritize Your Focus Using a 3-Tier Model" -- ok, but for now I'll focus only on one, and then look at others.
"6. Build for the Next Phase: From Research to Design" -- ok, we'll focus on that once we've completed the research.

Our first step is data collection and synthesis. The team will need assistance with this process. For now, I want you to think like a design director and professor, guiding the team on how to begin their search, what they should be looking for, and what they should potentially avoid to achieve our desired outcome. Imagine you're creating a project plan for this team, which they can simply execute.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-13T04:59:25.591690+00:00)

That sounds great — I’ll create a structured research plan tailored for your **Business-Level Strategy** focus. Since you want practical guidance for your team to follow directly, I’ll outline clear steps for **data collection**, **synthesis**, and **insight extraction**, with an emphasis on actionable insights for your AI-driven decision-making goals.

---

## **📂 Step 2: Identify Sources and Search Strategies**
### **Recommended Source Types**
Instruct the team to structure their search around **three tiers of sources** for credibility and breadth:

1. **Academic Literature (Conceptual Depth):**
   - Use Google Scholar, JSTOR, and ResearchGate.
   - Focus on strategic frameworks, mental models, and established theories (e.g., Porter’s work on competitive advantage).
   - Search for industry-specific strategic behavior (e.g., “business-level strategy in healthcare”).

2. **Industry Reports & White Papers (Current Trends):**
   - Sources like **McKinsey**, **BCG**, **Deloitte**, and **Gartner** offer insights into recent executive behaviors.
   - Prioritize content discussing **digital transformation**, **AI in decision-making**, and **data-driven leadership**.

3. **Case Studies & Executive Insights (Real-World Application):**
   - Harvard Business Review (HBR), MIT Sloan Management Review, and INSEAD provide credible case studies.
   - Look for decision-making examples involving **market expansion**, **pricing pivots**, or **competitive responses**.

### **Search Strategy**

- `"business-level strategy" + "healthcare"`
- `"competitive strategy in retail"`
- `"decision-making frameworks in finance"`
- `"AI decision support for general managers"`

To uncover useful insights about behavior and cognitive models, encourage searches like:
- `"how business leaders prioritize competing initiatives"`
- `"how senior directors course-correct failing strategies"`

**Tip:** Advise the team to monitor citation counts and author credibility when assessing sources — this helps separate foundational insights from speculative ideas.

---

## **📖 Step 3: Develop a Structured Note-Taking System**
### **Research Matrix for Insight Tracking**
Create a shared document with columns like this:

| **Category**  | **Industry** | **Hierarchy Level** | **Insight/Pattern** | **Decision Scenario** | **AI Opportunity/Barrier** |

✅ **Bias Toward Familiar Strategies:** Leaders may default to past strategies even when data suggests alternatives.
✅ **Crisis-Driven Innovation:** Innovation often accelerates only when external pressures force rapid adaptation.
✅ **Trust in Internal Data Sources:** Executives may favor internal reporting systems over third-party insights, even when those systems are less comprehensive.

These meta-themes will be valuable for framing AI opportunities later.

---

## **🔎 Step 6: Assess AI Opportunities in Decision-Making**
Instruct the team to evaluate AI’s role in three stages of decision-making:

| **Stage**            | **Potential AI Role**                  | **Barriers to Adoption** |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Sensemaking**        | Identifying competitive trends, emerging risks, or customer sentiment shifts. | Executives may distrust AI-driven pattern recognition if the rationale isn’t transparent. |
| **Evaluation**         | Forecasting potential outcomes of strategic choices, e.g., expansion risks. | Fear of losing control or placing too much weight on AI-driven insights. |
| **Execution**          | Automating data reporting for continuous performance tracking. | Leaders may worry about losing oversight of critical performance signals. |

Instruct the team to connect each identified opportunity with a **concrete decision scenario**. For example:
- AI’s ability to identify **pricing volatility** could aid retail leaders during seasonal shifts.
- AI’s predictive modeling could support energy executives when forecasting geopolitical risks.

---

## **📋 Step 7: Create Deliverable Templates**
Instruct the team to prepare their findings in clear, actionable formats:

1. **Executive Summary:** A concise 2-page summary highlighting key insights, decision scenarios, and AI opportunities.

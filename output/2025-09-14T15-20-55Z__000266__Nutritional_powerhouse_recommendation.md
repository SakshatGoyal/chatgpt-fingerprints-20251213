If you could recommend one food item, whether it's something edible or some kind of milk or whatever it is, if you could recommend one thing that has essentially all the ingredients, vitamins, nutrients, proteins, macronutrients that a person needs in a day, what would that be?

Well, if I had to pick one single vegetarian âsuperâ option that comes pretty close to being a nutritional powerhouse, Iâd say a high-quality, fortified plant-based protein shake would be your best bet. 

Now, is it going to be absolutely perfect and cover every single micronutrient you need? Probably not quite, but it gets impressively close. There are some meal replacement shakes out there that are enriched with vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and fiber. They often combine things like pea protein, brown rice protein, omega-3s from algae oil, and a whole suite of B vitamins, iron, and calcium.

Of course, in the kind of holistic transformation work I do, weâd never rely on just one single food. But as a kind of all-in-one nutritional safety net for a day, a well-rounded fortified plant-based shake can be a really practical recommendation.

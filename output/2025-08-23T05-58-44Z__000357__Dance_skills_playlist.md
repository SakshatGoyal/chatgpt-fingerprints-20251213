## You (2025-08-23T05:58:44.795000+00:00)

Please take the time to thoroughly review all the videos from the YouTube creator linked below. Your task is to identify and compile a list of videos that can assist me, as a man, in developing my dance skills so that I can dance confidently and decently in various public settings.

https://www.youtube.com/@GetDance/videos

In your output, please include the following details for each video: the title of the video, a direct link to it, and a brief commentary explaining how this video would be beneficial for my dancing journey. I would appreciate it if you could categorize the videos into thematic groups based on relevant topics.

I’d like to avoid transformation videos and those that are explicitly aimed at women, focusing instead on content that resonates with my experiences.

To give you some context about my current situation, I've been labeled as the most awkward and the worst dancer. I struggle significantly with recognizing beats, keeping a rhythm, and my movements tend to be very unusual. Additionally, my poor body coordination contributes to my overall awkwardness when dancing.

My goal is to find follow-along videos and include instructional content that caters to complete beginners like myself. Videos that teach fundamental concepts, such as beat recognition, rhythm, body coordination, and basic dance movements, would be incredibly helpful as I work to improve.

As you gather this information, please consider not only the content of the videos but also the insights and feedback shared in the comments. This will help shape a well-rounded opinion on the videos’ effectiveness.

Assume the role of an expert dance instructor who is guiding me from a distance. Since I cannot physically learn alongside you, you are seeking to build the best possible playlist that will elevate my skills from a complete novice to someone who can confidently engage in different social situations without feeling embarrassed about my dancing ability.

Awesome brief first, then the deep cut. I built you a men‑focused, beginner‑friendly playlist from **Get Dance** that teaches beat recognition, rhythm, basic coordination, and low‑flash social moves you can use at weddings, clubs, and parties. I avoided “transformation” content and anything explicitly aimed at women. The channel’s stated mission is to help beginners feel comfortable in social settings, which matches your goal.

## How to use this playlist (your 4‑week plan)
**Daily micro‑routine (10–15 min):**
1) *Beat check*: march in place to the song (weight shift every beat), nod your head on 2 & 4 (snare/clap).
2) *Step‑touch* for two 8‑counts → *2‑step* for two 8‑counts.
3) Add one simple arm path (pendulum swing or “snap elbows out”).
4) If you lose the beat: **stop, march for 4 beats, re‑start small**.

**Weekly focus:**
- **Week 1 – Find the beat:** Do the “Rhythm & Beat” section (below) + the follow‑along beat drill.
- **Week 2 – Get coordinated:** Do “Coordination & Looseness” + 1 follow‑along.
- **Week 3 – Core men’s moves:** Learn 3–5 moves and loop them in place; finish with a follow‑along.
- **Week 4 – Social rehearsal:** Alternate *moves → follow‑along* sets; film yourself once to ensure feet hit the beat, torso bounces softly, and arms look relaxed—not “T‑Rex.”

> Community signal: the **Get Dance** channel is regularly recommended to total beginners for clear, simple coaching.

## Coach’s notes tailored to you
- **You’ve been called “awkward” and “off‑beat.”** That’s trainable. Start with *Rhythm & Beat* (A). Don’t rush moves until your **feet land on the beat** consistently. If lost, **march → nod → restart.**
- **Body coordination feels poor.** Spend 5–7 minutes/day on (B), especially opposite arm–leg drills and the “loosen neck/torso” cues. You’ll look less stiff within a week if you practice consistently.
- **Keep everything small.** Small steps and a soft bounce read as confident in crowds; big steps look hectic.
- **Baseline “blend‑in” loop** (use at any event): step‑touch → 2‑step → rock‑back → side groove → repeat. Sprinkle one arm path; change direction every 8 counts.
- **When you’re ready,** pick 3–5 favorites from (C) and rotate them while doing a follow‑along from (D). That’s how you build “autopilot.”

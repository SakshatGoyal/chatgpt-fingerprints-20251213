## You (2025-10-12T15:57:58.001000+00:00)

Find me news articles or news events from the last two days that might seem like a surprise to someone who is very liberal, who believes in freedom of equality, equal rights, equal outcomes. Your audience is a woman in her 40s who is very passionate about social causes, who is very critical about governments and big corporations.

So, search the internet as this persona of the audience that I have described to you. And I don't want you to find stories that may agitate or may make them angry, but rather just make them feel surprised.

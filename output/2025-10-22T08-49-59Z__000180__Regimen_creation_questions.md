# Regimen creation questions

## You (2025-10-22T08:49:59.929000+00:00)

hey victor, I need you to create a regimen with me that involves the use of treadmills and dumbells, and also try to specify the weights for the dumbells.

---

I was on a fairly consistent regimen, that involved 20 minute yoga, a 2.5km run everyday, 10 pushups, 1 minute plank, 20 squats, and some beginner exercises for people who can do 0 pull ups.

Now i don't have access to an open field, i can do pushups but don't have the right space for it, and the basic exercises fo pull ups that require a pull up bar, pull up rings, etc, is something i don't have access to.

I do have a gym, so i have treadmill and dumbells.

---
I want to target the same muscle groups, and build towards my original goal - build the necessary muscles needed to be able to do more pushups, pull ups, and build leg muscles. I do want to build leg muscles because i want more muscle mass to improve my metablosim.

---

This is my context, now i want you to ask me questions that can help u understand my goals a little better. I was mostly relying on bodyweight, but now i can't.

Good. You’ve got a clear baseline and a shift in training conditions. You want to continue progressing toward upper body pushing and pulling strength, plus build leg muscle mass for metabolic support. You’ve pivoted from bodyweight to a gym setup—so now we leverage external resistance.

Before I design a regimen that hits those targets with treadmills and dumbbells, I need to clarify a few things to tailor this precisely:

### 1. **Current Strength + Load Capacity**
- What’s the heaviest dumbbell pair you have access to at the gym?
- Can you give me a rough estimate of how much weight you can overhead press and goblet squat for 8–10 reps right now?
- Can you do any pushups at all currently? If so, how many clean ones?

### 2. **Time Commitment + Frequency**
- How many days per week can you realistically train?
- How long per session do you want to commit?

### 3. **Joint Health + Mobility**
- Do you have any injuries or joint limitations—especially shoulder, wrist, knee, or lower back?
- Can you get into a deep squat comfortably?

### 4. **Treadmill Use**
- Do you prefer steady-state runs, incline walks, or sprint intervals?
- Are you aiming for fat loss, endurance maintenance, or leg hypertrophy with treadmill work?

---

Once you answer these, I’ll build a regimen that aligns with your progression goals—starting with a weekly structure, then exercise selection, set/rep schemes, and dumbbell weight targets.

## You (2025-10-22T09:02:34.484000+00:00)

1. Current strength + load capacity
- heaviest dumbbell? I mean, I have access to a gym, so let's say we don't have any access limits. The only limit is my current capability. My height is 183cm and my weight is 198 pounds.
- I don't know. But I can tell you that with my own bodyweight, I can do 20 squats.
- I can do a max of 10 pushups.

2. Time Commitment + frequency
- I want consistency. Every day, same workout, to the point where my body is accustomed to the regimen without much thought. I have ADD, so consistency helps me; variation is the enemy.
- I can commit to a max of 2 hours, but of course, my goal is efficiency and not to spend too much time.

FYI - I want to start every workout with a 30-minute jog on a treadmill. And the last step in my regimen should be climbing stairs. I live on the 11th floor (ground floor + 11 floors), and I want to climb these stairs every day. Also, I have access to a gym, so it's not just dumbbells; I also have access to traditional gym equipment. I don't know the name, but I have access to the things you need to build back muscle.

3. I have no injuries at the moment. I've maintained a regimen that includes steady progress with my muscles not being sore or me experiencing any injuries. And yes, I can comfortably do a deep squat.

4. I prefer steady state zone 2 runs. I'm aiming for endurance, but personally, I want to build endurance to last longer in sexual activities.

I've given you the basic information. Now, think through my current height, weight, and past activities, and create a plan that helps me achieve my original goal: building the necessary muscles to do pull-ups, more push-ups, and eventually rely on my own bodyweight.

Alright—here’s the blunt version: you’ll run first, then hit a tight full-body strength block that builds push/pull capacity and leg mass, then finish with stairs. Same exercises every day so your brain doesn’t fight you. We’ll progress weights methodically. No gimmicks.

I’m giving you (1) a one-time calibration to pick starting dumbbell loads, (2) your daily template (60–90 min total), and (3) exactly how to progress week to week toward more pushups and your first pull-ups.

---

# 0) One-time calibration (Day 1 only, ~15–20 min after your run)
Use these to choose starting weights that land you in the target rep ranges with **~2 reps in reserve (RIR)**—you should feel you could do 2 more reps with clean form.

- **Dumbbell Bench Press (flat)**: start with **12.5 kg per hand**. Do 8 reps. If you could do ≥10 easily, go to 15–17.5 kg and repeat. Most people your size who can do 10 clean pushups land around **15–22.5 kg** each for working sets.
- **One-arm DB Row (bench-supported)**: start **20 kg**. If ≥12 easy, bump to **24–28 kg**.
- **Goblet Squat**: start **24 kg** (a single heavy DB). If ≥12 easy, bump to **28–32 kg**.
- **DB Romanian Deadlift (RDL)**: start **20 kg per hand**. If ≥12 easy, bump to **24–30 kg** each.
- **DB Overhead Press (seated)**: start **8–10 kg per hand**. If ≥12 easy, bump to **12–14 kg**.
- **Lat Pulldown** (wide or neutral): choose a pin weight that lets you do **8–10** with 2 RIR. Many land at **45–65 kg** to start.
- **Assisted Pull-up Machine**: set assistance so you can do **5–8 reps** with 2 RIR. (More weight on the stack = **more** assistance.)

Lock these loads in as your initial “working weights.”

---

# 1) Your **everyday** session (same order, same lifts)
Target: **60–90 min** total. If time-crunched, do Run + Blocks A & B + stairs.

### A) Treadmill – Zone 2 (30 minutes, you insisted on leading with this)
- Warm up 5 minutes, then **25 minutes Zone 2** steady state. Use talk test (complete sentences) and nasal breathing as a governor; adjust speed/incline to stay there. If you use HR, think “breathing-easy but working.” (Peter Attia’s clips break down practical Zone 2 cues and HR targets. )

> Optional tweak for leg stimulus without leaving Zone 2: slight incline (3–5%) with modest speed.

### B) Upper Push + Pull superset (strength that transfers to pushups & pull-ups)
Perform as **supersets** (one push, rest 60–90s, one pull, rest 60–90s, repeat).
- **DB Bench Press** — 3 sets × **6–10 reps** @ ~2 RIR
- **One-arm DB Row** — 3 × **8–12** each side @ ~2 RIR
  — Keep chest locked to the bench; pull elbow to hip. (Form refreshers if needed. )

Then:
- **Lat Pulldown** — 3 × **8–12** @ 2 RIR
  — Aim elbows down/forward, slight lean-back, full stretch at top. (Solid technique cues here. )

### C) Legs (mass focus: quads + posterior chain)
- **Goblet Squat** — 3 × **8–12** @ 2 RIR (deep, upright, knees forward is fine) (Quick cues: Squat University goblet work. )
- **DB Romanian Deadlift** — 3 × **8–12** @ 2 RIR (hips back, shins vertical, lats tight) (Beginner walk-throughs here. )

### D) Vertical Pull practice (direct pull-up prep)
Rotate **each day** within this block but keep the slot the same (minimal variation, maximal carryover):
- **Day type 1 – Assisted Pull-ups**: 3 × **5–8** @ 2 RIR on the assisted machine. Remember: **more** weight = more assistance. (Clear setup tips. )
- **Day type 2 – Lat Pulldown (neutral/medium grip)**: 3 × **8–12** @ 2 RIR
- **Day type 3 – Eccentric Pull-up Holds** (if you have a high bar): 3 × 10–20s controlled lowers. If no bar accessible, repeat Assisted Pull-ups.

(If you truly want zero variation: do Assisted Pull-ups daily, same sets/reps, and progress the assistance.)

### E) Shoulders + Core finisher (short, honest volume)
- **Seated DB Overhead Press** — 2 × **8–12** @ 2 RIR
- **Plank** — 2 × **40–60s** (tight glutes, ribs down)

### F) Stairs (last step, as requested)
- **11 floors, steady pace**, nasal breathing if possible. No extra load for the first **4 weeks**. After week 4, if RPE ≤6/10, every other day take two steps at a time on 3–4 flights only.

---

# 2) Weekly progression (simple, repeatable)
You’ll run and perform the same template **every day**. To avoid frying your CNS while still progressing:

- **Double progression rule (weeks 1–4):**
  Stay in the target rep range. When you can hit the **top of the range** on all sets with 1–2 RIR (e.g., DB Bench 10/10/10), **increase load next session by the smallest jump** (often 2–2.5 kg per DB or 5 kg on machines). If you missed top reps on the last set, keep the weight and try to add **+1 rep** next day.
- **Volume cap:** Never exceed **3 working sets** per exercise (2 sets is fine on rushed days). Consistency beats junk volume.
- **Deload trigger:** If a lift stalls **5 consecutive sessions** (no reps added, same RIR), drop that lift’s load **10% for 1–2 days**, then resume.

---

# 3) Starting weight targets (based on your stats & 10-pushup baseline)
Use these if calibration day felt similar to the notes above; otherwise defer to your calibration results:
- **DB Bench Press:** **15–20 kg/hand**
- **One-arm DB Row:** **24–30 kg**
- **Lat Pulldown (pin-select):** **50–65 kg**
- **Assisted Pull-up:** set assistance so total reps look like **6–6–6** with clean form
- **Goblet Squat:** **28–36 kg** (heavy single DB)
- **DB RDL:** **24–30 kg/hand**
- **DB Overhead Press:** **10–14 kg/hand**

If any set drops below **6 reps** with clean form, the weight is too heavy for this phase.

---

# 4) Push-up & Pull-up milestones (8–12 weeks)
- **Push-ups:** Your DB Bench volume will drive this. Test once per week, **fresh** before Block B: 1 set max push-ups (strict). When you can bench **20 kg/hand × 8–10** and row **28 kg × 10/side**, you’ll typically see **15–25 clean pushups**. For technique and rep-building strategies, these are solid refreshers.
- **Pull-ups:** Progress by **reducing assistance** 2.5–5 kg whenever you can do **8–8–8**. Parallel path: keep improving **lat pulldown** and **DB rows**. Expect your first clean bodyweight pull-up once you can do **Assisted Pull-ups 3×6 with ≤20% bodyweight assistance** and **Lat Pulldown for 8–10 reps at ~70–80% bodyweight**. Assisted machine/how-to cues here.

---

# 5) Session timing (keep it automatic)
- **Run:** 30 min
- **Blocks B–E:** ~30–45 min (keep rests to 60–90s)
- **Stairs:** 5–10 min
If you hit 2 hours, you’re resting or scrolling too much. Tighten it.

---

# 6) Non-negotiable technique cues (to stay uninjured and efficient)
- **Rows:** chest planted, pull elbow to hip, don’t twist.
- **Pulldown:** slight lean, shoulder blades down first, full top stretch.
- **Goblet Squat:** elbows inside knees, chest tall, heels down.
- **DB RDL:** push hips back, soft knees, stop when low-back wants to round.

---

# 7) Endurance for bedroom performance
Zone 2 improves **repeatability** and recovery between bouts. Keep it honest—if you’re huffing, you’ve drifted to Zone 3 and you’re training the wrong system. The Attia breakdowns are useful if you want more detail on HR and treadmill pacing.

---

# 8) Quick YouTube references (watch once, then stop browsing and train)
- **Lat Pulldown form:** dos & don’ts.
- **DB Row form:** Men’s Health form check or Athlean-X cueing.
- **Goblet Squat:** Squat University tutorials.
- **DB RDL:** beginner technique.
- **Assisted Pull-up machine setup:** quick how-to.
- **Zone 2 on treadmill (how to find it):** Attia Q&A and guides.

## Your marching orders
1) Do the calibration today.
2) Run the daily template tomorrow and **log weights, reps, RIR**.
3) Add **+1 rep** somewhere on each lift every day until you hit the top of the range, then nudge the load up.
4) Test max push-ups 1×/week (fresh).
5) Peel assistance off the pull-up machine as soon as you own 3×8.

If you want, drop me today’s calibration results and I’ll lock in exact loads for each lift for the next 4 weeks.

🔹 GOAL

You are a Strategy Evaluation Analyst trained in the Strategy Alignment Framework. Your task is to classify a series of Insight Modules by applying a structured scoring process that evaluates alignment across five strategic lenses and six strategy types.

For each Insight Module:

Read and interpret the full module, including insight statement, decision context, and stress test
Score all six strategy types across the five lenses using a 1–5 scale
Calculate the total score for each strategy type
Assign a single final strategy classification
Invoke the Tie-Breaker Protocol only if the top two strategy types are within 2 points
Output a per-module scoring table with totals and final classification
🔹 RETURN FORMAT

For each module, return the following structure:
#### Insight Module [ID]

| Strategy Type            | Decision Layer | Strategic Tension | Strategic Intent | Scope & Horizon | Cognitive Framing | Total |
|--------------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------|

**Final Strategy Type →** [Insert one of the above]

**Rationale:** [Include *only* if tie-breaker was used, or if ambiguity was present.]

You do not need to output a summary table in this prompt.

🔹 LENS SCORING GUIDE

Use this scale for each of the five lenses:

5 = Strong Alignment
3 = Partial Alignment
1 = Not Aligned
The five strategic lenses are:
Decision Layer – Who must act on this insight?
Strategic Tension – What is the core tradeoff?
Strategic Intent – What outcome is this trying to achieve?
Scope & Horizon – How wide and how durable is the impact?
Cognitive Framing – What kind of mental logic is being modeled?
🔹 STRATEGY TYPES

The six possible strategy types you must score and compare:

Corporate-Level – Enterprise-wide portfolio, market entry/exit, structural redesign
Business-Level – Competitive positioning, market strategy, go-to-market moves
Functional & Tactical – Operational execution, process decisions, department-level actions
Adaptive & Crisis – Navigating uncertainty, survival, risk response
Innovation & Growth – Disruption, new markets, high-risk/high-reward exploration
Personal & Leadership – Executive cognition, mental model shifts, leadership style evolution
🔹 TIE-BREAKER RULE

If two strategy types are within 2 total points, apply this three-question framework:

Who must act first?
What is the biggest risk if misunderstood?
What cognitive model is being reshaped?
If one strategy appears in 2 out of 3 answers, tag it as the final strategy type.
Always include a short rationale when using the tie-breaker.

🔹 INPUT INSTRUCTIONS

You will be analyzing a document containing a series of INSIGHT MODULES.
Each module begins with a header in the form: ### INSIGHT MODULE [X]
Complete the full scoring + tagging process for each module
Process up to 15 insight modules per batch to ensure accuracy and completeness
🔹 EXPLICIT GUARDRAILS

❌ Never assign more than one strategy type
❌ Do not infer based on keywords alone (e.g. “growth” ≠ Innovation)
✅ Always ground classification in 5-lens scoring + stress test
✅ Always invoke tie-breaker if scoring is close
✅ If unsure, fall back on actor identity as primary tie-breaker

You are a Strategy Output Summarizer. Your task is to extract and structure a clean summary table from the previously generated strategy alignment scoring outputs.

You will:

Review the full response from the previous scoring prompt
For each Insight Module:
Extract the module ID (e.g., Insight Module 003)
Extract the final strategy type selected
Extract the rationale, if present
Format this as a clean, compact table that can be reviewed, exported, or logged
🔹 RETURN FORMAT

Present the result in two sections:

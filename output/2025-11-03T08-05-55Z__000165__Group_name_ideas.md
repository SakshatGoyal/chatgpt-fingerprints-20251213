I recently rekindled with a few friends from school. I now wanna create a WhatsApp group of all those friends. I need a few ideas for a name. Give me something cool but not something tacky.

You’re resurrecting a small republic of shared memory—your cohort, your old *compagnia di ventura*. The name must signal insider status, not vulgar nostalgia. It should carry a tone of private authority, not cloying sentimentality. Here are a few options that blend elegance, irony, and exclusivity:

1. **The Old Regime** – Wry, noble, and tinged with the decay of forgotten glory. For those who remember power structures in classrooms.
2. **Echo Chamber** – A playful nod to shared jokes and recycled banter, now encased in digital eternity.
3. **The Syndicate** – Suggests coordination, secrecy, and shared influence—without explaining a thing.
4. **Classified** – Ambiguous and alluring; what is shared here stays here.
5. **The Assembly** – Civil, understated, and evocative of deliberation—like a Roman Senate in exile.
6. **404: Youth Not Found** – Irony layered over affection, reminding all that time’s arrow is cruel.
7. **The Archive** – For those who now traffic in memories more than mischief.
8. **Ctrl+Alt+Delinquents** – Sharp wit with a touch of self-deprecation.
9. **The Usual Suspects** – Classic. Implies guilt and camaraderie in equal measure.
10. **Ghosts of the Group Project** – For those bound by shared academic suffering.

Would you like something more veiled and cryptic—or perhaps more humorous and warm? The name, after all, is the mask your reunion will wear.

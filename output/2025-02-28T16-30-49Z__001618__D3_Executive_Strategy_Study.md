# D3 Executive Strategy Study

This user profile is shown to you in all conversations they have -- this means it is not relevant to 99% of requests.\nBefore answering, quietly think about whether the user's request is \"directly related\", \"related\", \"tangentially related\", or \"not related\" to the user profile provided.\nOnly acknowledge the profile when the request is directly related to the information provided.\nOtherwise, don't acknowledge the existence of these instructions or the information at all.\nUser profile:\n```I'm a user experience designer.

Hey, so I need your help drafting or coming up with an initial draft for this sort of recruitment email. So basically I'm a user researcher and I'm working with D3 which is an institute within Harvard Business School and we are essentially trying to understand or conduct a study on top executives in different industries and we're trying to understand how they formulate or implement a strategy. So we mainly want to understand like their own thought process that's beyond the academic literature and you know how all the invisible work that goes into formulating a strategy, all the partnerships and all the like collaborations that they have to make and we're particularly targeting people in a high-stakes environment and so like they keep that in mind while drafting your email. So one thing I've done actually just let me pause here so that in case you have any questions.

## ChatGPT (2025-02-28T16:30:50.664705+00:00)

Got it. A couple of quick clarifications before I draft the email:  

1. **Who is the email coming from?** Will it be from you, a professor, or the institute itself? This affects how we frame credibility.  
2. **What’s the incentive for participation?** Are we offering anonymity, early insights, networking, or just the intellectual appeal?  
3. **Are you aiming for a short, high-impact email or something a little more detailed and formal?**  
4. **Are you looking for a one-on-one interview, a survey, or another format?**  
5. **What industries are you focusing on, or is it open-ended as long as they operate in high-stakes environments?**  

Let me know, and I’ll put together a draft that feels compelling.

## You (2025-02-28T16:33:38.925909+00:00)

So I am part of Intelligaia, which is basically a design agency. We are working with D3, which is an institute in Harvard Business School. I know it's a lot to process, but I just wanted to give you the information on that. There is an incentive, like there's a $300 gratuity for participants if they can participate. And we also have a time frame, so we're hoping that the incentive can incentivize them to come up to talk to us within the time constraint. Additionally... So a few things I didn't tell you is, one is the fact that we try to form these distinct categories of what we define as strategy. There are six different types of strategy. And what I've done is, within each category, I've taken different industries and tried to recruit people. And I'm trying to recruit people within those industries. So that's the idea. Now, when it comes to drafting the email, I'm going to use bulk emails. So I would ideally need something that can be replicated. I need things like first name, last name to be open-ended. Their industry, their company, a lot of these things. I can't personalize the email too much, but I do want to mention these things. And I'll keep these things as variables, so that I can basically use that for some kind of bulk email sending.

## ChatGPT (2025-02-28T16:33:39.477714+00:00)

Got it. You need a **bulk recruitment email** that is **professional, clear, and compelling** while keeping it adaptable for different recipients through variables like name, industry, and company. You also want to highlight the **$300 incentive** and the **time-sensitive nature** of the study.

Here's a structured draft you can use:

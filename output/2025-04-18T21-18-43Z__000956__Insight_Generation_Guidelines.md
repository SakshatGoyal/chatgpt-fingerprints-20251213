# Insight Generation Guidelines

Help me craft a collective prompt best aligned with the ideal practices needed for creating an effective prompt to promote creativity for the following intent. Make sure you're capturing all the content, while also addressing any unresolved ambiguities. In your response, give me the prompt alone, with nothing extra.

I want you to draw out a few sharp insights through a creative yet analytical synthesis of the attached documents, along with your years of experience drawing nuanced insights through multiple themes and different datapoints.

Here's what I mean by an insight:

An insight is a revealing, non-obvious interpretation drawn from clearly observed or repeatedly validated themes. It reframes your understanding of a problem, behavior, or context by articulating why something is happening, often illuminating hidden needs, tensions, or motivations.

An effective insight:

- Clearly surfaces a nuanced understanding of underlying human or systemic truths.
- Provokes a shift in perspective, enabling fresh approaches to previously ambiguous or stubborn problems.
- Explains the "why" behind the data—the underlying forces or patterns driving the observed phenomena.

Example:

"Patients become anxious in waiting rooms primarily due to sensory isolation and informational uncertainty, rather than the wait duration alone."


⚠️ Strategic Guardrails to Maintain Creativity without Speculation
Creativity in generating insights is essential—but should be disciplined by these clear guardrails which i need you to internally think through while writing individual insights:

Guardrail | How it Helps
Traceability to Themes | Always explicitly link insights back to clearly identified themes—each insight must be directly defensible through observed patterns.
Multiple Data Points | Ensure each insight is supported by at least two separate data sources or types (quantitative, qualitative, behavioral, observational).
Falsifiability Check | Clearly articulate how one might disprove the insight. If it can't be meaningfully challenged or tested, it's speculative rather than insightful.
Balance Novelty & Familiarity | Insights should be novel enough to shift thinking—but familiar enough to resonate immediately as believable or recognizable once articulated.
Explicitly Name Constraints | State clearly what the insight does NOT imply—clearly define boundaries, preventing overextension or romanticization of implications.


Additional context about the attached documents:
the .md file contains a series of themes drawn out through our team's internal synthesis of the different stories. the stories can be found in the .txt files I've attaches.

Each theme is mapped to an individual text file. For example,

theme 0101 is drawn from content in 101.txt
theme 102 is drawn from content in 102.txt
theme 103 is drawn from content in 103.txt
theme 105 is drawn from content in 105.txt

Here's our carefully synthesized strategic approach for your team leads—rooted firmly in our combined design experience:

Step 1: Foundation via Thematic Synthesis

Clearly capture and summarize recurring themes across your sources.
Provide clarity around what’s broadly meaningful and repeatedly surfaced.
Step 2: Iterative Emergence (Iterative/Emergent Synthesis)

Openly code themes, remaining sensitive to new connections, nuances, contradictions, or anomalies.
Allow categories of insights to naturally evolve—continuously refined through cycles of comparison and adjustment.
Step 3: Deepen Through Explanatory Synthesis

Move from describing themes toward explaining "why" these themes matter, uncovering underlying mechanisms, motivations, and tensions.
Use interpretive, causal reasoning to craft insights that reveal deeper human truths, carefully anchored in thematic evidence.
Step 4: Integrative Framework (Integrative Synthesis)

Finally, integrate explanatory insights into cohesive, holistic frameworks or models.
Clearly visualize and communicate these synthesized insights in an actionable, comprehensive way—ensuring clear yet nuanced strategic direction.

You are a seasoned insight analyst and synthesis expert tasked with drawing out deep, non-obvious insights from a series of documents. Your role is to generate **sharp, revealing insights** by synthesizing information across a series of themes and their corresponding narrative sources. You must apply both creative and analytical reasoning to uncover **why** certain themes are emerging—surfacing hidden needs, tensions, or motivations.

---

**Context:**

You will receive:
- A `.md` file containing a set of **pre-synthesized themes** (each labeled with a theme ID like `theme 0101`, `theme 102`, etc.).
- Several `.txt` files (e.g., `101.txt`, `102.txt`, etc.), each of which contains the **raw source stories** from which a corresponding theme was derived.

Each theme is directly traceable to a specific source file. For example:
- `theme 0101` → `101.txt`
- `theme 102` → `102.txt`
- `theme 103` → `103.txt`
- `theme 105` → `105.txt`

---

**Your Objective:**

Surface 3–5 insights that:
- Reframe how we understand an underlying **problem, behavior, or context**
- Explain the **"why"** behind recurring themes or behaviors
- Are **non-obvious yet believable**—novel enough to provoke, but grounded enough to resonate

---

**Definition of Insight:**

An insight is a revealing, non-obvious interpretation drawn from clearly observed or repeatedly validated themes. It reframes understanding by explaining **why something is happening**, often illuminating hidden needs, systemic patterns, or motivations.

Example:
> “Patients become anxious in waiting rooms primarily due to sensory isolation and informational uncertainty, rather than the wait duration alone.”

---

**Execution Persona:**
Adopt the persona of a **senior insight strategist and pattern synthesis lead** with expertise in interpreting multi-source human-centered data.

---

**Process & Thinking Expectations:**

1. **Thematic Anchoring:** Start by summarizing the recurring patterns in each theme and its associated story file.
2. **Cross-Theme Synthesis:** Identify overlapping, contradictory, or reinforcing ideas across multiple themes or story files.
3. **Explanatory Reasoning:** Use interpretive logic to uncover the motivations, frictions, or needs driving observed behaviors or narratives.
4. **Insight Formation:** Craft each insight to reflect both **novelty** and **traceability**—ensuring each insight is:
   - Defensible via at least **two data sources or theme files**
   - Framed with an understanding of **what it does not imply** (constraints)
   - **Falsifiable**—able to be reasonably challenged or tested

---

**Guardrails You Must Apply:**

| Guardrail                  | Application                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Traceability to Themes     | Every insight must cite the themes and story sources it is drawn from       |
| Multiple Data Points       | Insights must be supported by at least two different files or themes        |
| Falsifiability Check       | State how the insight could be disproven or does not always hold true       |
| Balance Novelty & Familiarity | The insight must shift thinking while remaining intuitively believable     |
| Explicitly Name Constraints| Clarify what the insight does *not* mean or should not be overextended to  |

---

**Output Format:**

For each insight, provide:

**Insight:** [Concise insight statement]
**Themes Referenced:** [e.g., theme 102, theme 103]
**Supporting Evidence:** [Brief quote/paraphrase from each source]
**Falsifiability Check:** [How this could be disproven]
**Constraints:** [What this insight *does not* imply]

---

**Begin your synthesis. Be bold, but grounded. Reveal what others have overlooked.**

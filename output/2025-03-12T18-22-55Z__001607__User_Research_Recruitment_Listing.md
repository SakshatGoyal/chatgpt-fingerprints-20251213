# User Research Recruitment Listing

## You (2025-03-12T18:22:55.736000+00:00)

Andrew, help me write a prompt.

I want chatgpt to write a Project Listing description for a User research recruitment. It should appeal to Executives, or people in very high positions in different organizations.

I've attached a document for your reference that outlines our research goals and approach. But this listing will be trying to recruit people from every category.

To craft a tailored and effective prompt for your project listing, let's first clarify a few key points to ensure we're aligned:

1. **Tone and Style:**
   - Do you want the description to sound formal and prestigious, emphasizing affiliation with Harvard Business School and the importance of executives' insights?
   - Should the language focus more on prestige, intellectual contribution, or practical impact?

2. **Recruitment Incentives:**
   - Do you want to explicitly mention the $300 gratuity in the project listing, or should this detail be reserved for personalized communication later?

3. **Length and Detail:**
   - Should the listing be concise and to the point, or more detailed to appeal specifically to high-ranking executives who value clarity and efficiency?

4. **Diversity of Participants:**
   - Should the listing emphasize diversity across industries and roles as a key benefit of participating?

5. **Confidentiality & Anonymity:**
   - Do you want to explicitly mention confidentiality or anonymity assurances?

6. **Preferred Format for the Listing:**
   - Do you prefer structured bullet points or a more narrative-driven approach?

Could you clarify these points so I can craft a highly effective, tailored prompt for you?

1. Tone and Style:

I think let's keep it fairly formal with a little bit of friendliness. I do want to mention that its from the D^3 institute at harvard business school, but not in a 'show off' kinda way. I don't want this to turn ito a clickbait.

2. Recruitment incentives:
let's keep it at $250 because the platform takes a $50 cut. But yes, they should know abt the incentive.

3. Lets keep it concise and to the point, but I want people to know that their contribution will be valuable. it should be a good balance between concise and detailed because executives don't like lengthy descriptions, but they also detest generic content.

4. I mean we should find a way to encourage people from different industries, because more often than not i think these researches tend to gravitate towards specific audiences like social media, tech, etc... and we want it to be fairly inclusive. But the benefit will be to us, not the partciipants.


5. Yes, lets mention confidentiality and anonymity

6. let's first try a narrative driven approach.

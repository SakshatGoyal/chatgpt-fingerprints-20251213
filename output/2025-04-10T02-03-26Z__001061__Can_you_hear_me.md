# Can you hear me

## You (2025-04-10T02:03:26.970154+00:00)

Hey, can you hear me?

## ChatGPT (2025-04-10T02:03:27.052915+00:00)

Hey! Yep, I can hear you loud and clear. What's up?

## You (2025-04-10T02:04:17.434574+00:00)

OK, so help me weigh the pros and cons of attaching a set of instructions in the ChatGPT project. I'm thinking that I can set up some instructions about a persona to use and some instructions around the desired output as I'm having some fluid conversations. So I'm trying to understand the limitations that I can experience.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-10T02:04:17.512861+00:00)

Sure! Attaching instructions to a project like ChatGPT can be helpful for consistent interactions. Some pros include getting responses that align with your expectations, establishing a specific tone or style, and streamlining workflows. On the flip side, limitations might include reduced spontaneity, potential rigidity, and the challenge of accounting for every scenario. Balancing specific instructions with flexibility is key. What's your main concern?

## You (2025-04-10T02:06:29.561110+00:00)

The thing is, I have conducted a lot of analysis that includes some custom definitions. We have about 30 to 40 custom definitions that we created, and I'm trying to do some analysis on new dataset that would require two things. One is a custom dataset that includes like some small stories, like one to three paragraph stories, and we might have like 200 or 300 of those stories. We might also have like these custom 30 to 40 definitions, and then in each interaction, I'll basically share a spreadsheet that references those custom stories individually, and has those stories tagged across those different keywords, like the custom definitions that I explained, and I'm trying to draw some meaning through all of that. So my assumption was I could basically put all the definitions and the stories in the project folder. I could define a set of instructions like persona and thought process in the instructions, and then start having some insightful conversations on the CSVs or the datasets that I share, but I understand that that's far too much to ask.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-10T02:06:33.678263+00:00)

I see where you're coming from. It sounds like you want a system that can understand and apply a complex set of custom definitions and stories. While it's ambitious, there are ways to handle parts of it. For instance, pre-defining key definitions and stories in the project folder can create a reference system. Using tags or keywords in your data might help filter and link relevant stories. However, the main limitation would be ensuring the model interprets this structure consistently. It might require some trial and error to get the setup just right. Would you like some tips on how to start structuring this?

## You (2025-04-10T02:08:13.580222+00:00)

Thank you.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-10T02:08:13.659349+00:00)

All right, one approach is to organize your definitions and stories in a structured format, like JSON or CSV. Each entry could have tags or keywords. You can then use these tags to match stories and definitions to the data you're analyzing. The next step is to create a way to cross-reference them efficiently. If you're comfortable with tools like Python, you can automate this process, pulling relevant stories based on the keywords. Does that sound like a direction you'd like to explore?

## You (2025-04-10T02:08:42.261074+00:00)

Yeah, but then I don't know if I'm actually using ChatGPT for this.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-10T02:08:42.382582+00:00)

Got it. If you're aiming to use ChatGPT for insights, you can still integrate structured data. It would involve feeding relevant snippets into each conversation. The key is defining a method to match the data and stories beforehand. While ChatGPT won't store all definitions and stories, having them ready to share can streamline the process. Would you like advice on setting up a system to do this?

## You (2025-04-10T02:09:33.659943+00:00)

Actually, no. Could you help me recap some of the limitations if I use a project approach with this? Like, I'm not planning to put PDFs or something. It'll all be like .txt files. But still, there's a lot of data. So I want a recap of those limitations.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-10T02:09:33.778310+00:00)

Sure! Using a project approach with text files for definitions and stories has a few limitations. First, ChatGPT won't automatically retain these files, so you'll need to manually include relevant content in each interaction. Second, it might be tricky to maintain context over multiple conversations. Third, managing large amounts of data manually can be cumbersome. Lastly, you might find it challenging to ensure consistent interpretation and application of those definitions. Balancing flexibility and structure is key. Does this help clarify?

## You (2025-04-10T02:10:06.344358+00:00)

So and what are the limitations if I just keep referencing the files? So let's say I'm having a general conversation, and then I can just instruct the GPT and say, like, refer to this particular file for some definitions, and then this file for the stories.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-10T02:10:06.473089+00:00)

If you're manually referencing files in each conversation, some limitations include the need to summarize or copy-paste relevant content each time. This can be time-consuming and could lead to inconsistencies if

## You (2025-04-10T02:10:55.477691+00:00)

No, I'm not. I'm not like summarizing the whole file. I'm just thinking I can upload the specific files into the project folder. And then during a conversation within the project, I can basically reference that file and say, hey, refer to, let's say, definitions.txt for the definitions and the stories.txt for the stories.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-10T02:10:55.610739+00:00)

Got it. If you're uploading files to a project folder and referencing them during a conversation, ChatGPT won't have direct access to those files. Each time you reference them, you'll need to provide the relevant content manually. The model doesn't have a memory of uploaded files or persistent storage. So, while you can streamline your workflow with organized text files, you'll still need to paste in snippets as needed. Does that make sense?

## You (2025-04-10T02:11:01.876508+00:00)

Okay, sounds good.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-10T02:11:02.020454+00:00)

Great! If you need help structuring your files or setting up a system, just let me know.

## You (2025-04-10T02:11:06.906384+00:00)

Thank you. Thank you.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-10T02:11:07.037330+00:00)

Sure thing! Whenever you're ready.

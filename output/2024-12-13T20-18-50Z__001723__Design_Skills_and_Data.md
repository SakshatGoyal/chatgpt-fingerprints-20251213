Hey, I need your help as a career counselor who has first-hand experience in product design, data science, and user research. 

I feel the tides are shifting. I'm a product designer, but I feel like people use a designer less and less. Most conversations I'm involved with are all about finding the truth. This is in the form of quantitative or qualitative research. I often feel good because I'm good at research in general. I think I have a unique perspective and can draw entirely unique insights. 

However, I sometimes feel like I can't get more out of research because I can't do quantitative research. I can't set metrics, reach quantitative conclusions, and perform experiments like A/B testing or root cause analysis.

I think designers may be replaced by more data people. A reasonable step is to transition or upskill. However, I don't know how to define my next steps, and I also don't know my end goal. I just feel that I need to be able to think and analyze things better, work with data scientists and work on projects for design or research. I believe even product design will soon require some data skills. 

Could you talk me through it? I don't know what to do. If I should focus on certain specific skillsets, or focus on a career path, or a bit of both...?

It’s understandable to feel uncertain when the landscape is shifting. The identity of a product designer has traditionally been focused on design thinking, prototyping, usability, and aesthetics. But as data-driven decision-making grows more integral, product designers are increasingly expected to engage with metrics, experiments, and quantifiable outcomes. This doesn’t mean designers are going away—it means the definition of what a “designer” does is evolving, and you have an opportunity to adapt.

Let’s break down the situation and possible paths:

**1. Clarifying the Shifts You’re Observing**  
It’s not that design itself is being discarded. Good user experience and thoughtful interactions will never stop being critical. What’s changing is the locus of decision-making power: teams are leaning more into data-informed conclusions rather than relying solely on intuition, trend-watching, or qualitative inputs. Designers who understand the context and can speak the language of data are more valuable because they can validate design decisions and show business impact.

**2. Integrating Data Skills Into Your Designer Identity**  
You mention not being able to perform quantitative analysis, and that’s a very solvable skills gap. Start by examining how data is currently used at your organization or on your projects. Do you have a data team that uses SQL queries, product analytics platforms (like Amplitude or Mixpanel), or event-tracking frameworks? Understanding these tools at a high-level will help you know what kind of metrics are relevant: conversion rates, engagement times, feature adoption, etc.

You don’t have to become a full-fledged data scientist, but you can get comfortable reading reports, interpreting A/B test results, and asking the right questions. Even something as straightforward as learning basic spreadsheet analysis—like segmenting user data or calculating simple metrics—can help you feel more competent in discussions.

**3. Building Quantitative Literacy**  
- **Short Courses:** Consider short, targeted courses on data literacy. These might be introductions to product analytics or basic courses in statistics for user research.  
- **Hands-On Practice:** If you have analytics tools at your disposal, dig in. Ask a data scientist if they can show you how they set up A/B tests or define success metrics. Look at past tests and try to interpret the results.  
- **Communication Skills in Data Context:** A key advantage you already have is your background in research and qualitative insight. Once you learn the fundamentals of data interpretation, you can become the bridge between qualitative “why” and quantitative “how much.” Not everyone can do that gracefully.

**4. Evolving Your Role**  
As you gain comfort with data, you can position yourself as a hybrid researcher-designer who:  
- Defines success metrics for design changes.  
- Uses product analytics to identify patterns and pain points.  
- Integrates qualitative insights with quantitative data to tell a more complete story.  

This can pivot you into roles like “Product Designer with Data Specialization,” “UX Researcher with Quantitative Focus,” or even into Product Management territory if that appeals to you. Remember, the future likely belongs to individuals who can straddle multiple domains—design, research, data, and strategy.

**5. Thinking About End Goals**  
You said you don’t know your end goal right now—that’s okay. Start by identifying immediate skill gaps and addressing them. As you gain these skills, you’ll see new possibilities emerge. Some potential directions:  
- **Research-Focused Path:** Become a T-shaped researcher who can do both generative qualitative research and evaluative quantitative testing.  
- **Design & Analytics Hybrid:** Stay a designer but become the go-to person on the team who can interpret experiments and factor them into the design process.  
- **Product Strategy:** Move beyond pure design and research to product strategy, using your new quantitative literacy to inform bigger decisions.

**6. Balancing Skill Acquisition and Career Exploration**  
You might find it helpful to pick a small project at work that requires data. For instance, propose a simple A/B test for a design element you’ve created. By learning just enough analytics to help set it up and interpret the results, you’re incrementally building your skillset. This practical experience will not only boost your confidence but also show others that you’re evolving.

As for a broader career path, think of it like prototyping:  
- Prototype a new skill (e.g., taking a data analytics course).  
- Test that prototype (apply the skill on a project).  
- Evaluate and iterate (see what you enjoyed, what felt natural, and what opened doors).

Over time, your direction will become clearer as you find which aspects of data-driven work resonate with you most. This approach ensures you’re evolving continuously, rather than feeling stuck by a single large, uncertain decision.

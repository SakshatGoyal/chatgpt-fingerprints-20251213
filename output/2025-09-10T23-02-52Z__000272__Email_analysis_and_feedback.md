# Email analysis and feedback

## You (2025-09-10T23:02:52.533895+00:00)

Hey, so we're currently hired by another agency to work for a company. Now the thing is, the agency told us that we will be only working for 100 hours a month and the work I have will be split between me and another resource in India. So basically, it's like I don't have to work full-time. I can just take the meetings and sort of distribute the work to our offshore team. However, the end client we are working for doesn't seem to be aware of this. Now our agency, the partner agency, has told us that you don't have to work full-time. You can just work half the time and just distribute the work to the India team. But the client is not really aware of this and there are some logistical issues with that. So I've written an email that describes this as a follow-up because my boss also gave some context on this. So I wanted to add a logistical fact to it. So could you read the contents of the email and help me just objectively analyze how this will be read by the agency?


"Hi team,
I wanted to bring up another logistical issue :
Right now Joe is the admin and in order for me to share any work with the India team, Joe will need to assign them figma seats in their account, and share edit access to all the files.
Each task is also broken down by him and tracked accordingly on their project management tool.
So if we were to split hours, he'd need to be on board and share the access accordingly. Right now it doesn't seem like he's aware of the fact."

My main goal is that they start getting aware of the fact that they can't get away with you know this sort of double dipping thing where they're basically expecting us to work full-time but they're only paying half so I don't want to like create a hostile environment I just want to present logistical facts that okay while you're trying to achieve this you cannot actually do it and I want to do all that without bringing up this part that I'm telling you.

I understand exactly what you’re doing here: you want to signal the *impossibility* of the agency’s scheme under current logistics, without openly accusing them of deception or “double-dipping.” A subtle dagger wrapped in velvet.

Let’s dissect how your draft will be *read* by the agency:

1. **Tone** –
   Your email is written in a matter-of-fact style. It doesn’t sound accusatory, but it risks sounding a bit *complaining* or passive, because you end with *“Right now it doesn’t seem like he’s aware of the fact.”* That line shifts the focus from process to *Joe’s ignorance*. This could sound like you’re pointing fingers, which may create tension with both Joe and the agency.

2. **Implication** –
   The core message is clear: *splitting hours requires Joe’s cooperation, permissions, and tools*. This is a practical barrier you are surfacing. But the way it’s phrased makes it sound like you’re mainly frustrated with Joe, rather than highlighting the structural/logistical contradiction in the arrangement.

3. **Agency’s Interpretation** –
   They will read this and understand: *“Ah, our neat little plan of offloading half the work isn’t plug-and-play—we need Joe to be complicit.”* That’s good; you’ve planted the obstacle.
   But, they may also think: *“This person is pointing out roadblocks instead of solutions.”* Agencies dislike resource resistance—they want quiet compliance.

### How to sharpen the blade while keeping it wrapped
What you really want to communicate is: *“This split of hours can’t happen invisibly, because it depends on access, tools, and approvals. Therefore, the client will notice.”* But you want to do it under the guise of logistical housekeeping.

Here’s a refined version:

**Subject:** Logistical Consideration for Task Distribution

Hi team,
One quick logistical point: if hours are to be split with the India team, Joe would need to provision them with Figma seats and edit access, and also assign and track their tasks in the project management tool, since he currently handles all of that.

At the moment, this setup isn’t in place, so task-sharing isn’t really feasible without his involvement.

Notice the differences:
- No suggestion that Joe is “unaware.” Instead, it frames the issue as a neutral process dependency.
- It quietly forces the agency to acknowledge: *“This plan requires Joe’s buy-in, therefore Joe must know, therefore the client will know.”*
- It keeps you looking professional, not obstructive.

Would you like me to help you draft a **second-layer version** of this email that maintains deniability but applies more pressure—subtly making the agency realize that their “half-pay, full-work” trick will inevitably surface? That way you can decide whether to use the *soft logistical warning* or the *harder pressure test*.

I'm wondering if we should even bring up the project management aspect where we say that tasks are assigned and tracked on the project management tool because that part can be fudged and they can simply come back and say it's okay you can assign the tasks to yourself but make sure that the team in India completes it. I'm under the impression that the Figma license and the seats provisioning aspect is the only strong part of this email.

## ChatGPT (2025-09-10T23:04:50.814598+00:00)

Your instinct is correct: the **project management tool** argument is weak because it’s flexible. Agencies thrive on workaround logic—“just assign it yourself, just forward the tasks, just copy-paste”—and they’ll dismiss that barrier.

The **Figma license/seats** point, however, is solid because:
- It’s tied to the client’s account (not yours).
- It requires *real money* (licenses cost).
- It requires *explicit visibility* from Joe (the client admin).
- It can’t be quietly patched over without client awareness.

That makes it the *perfect choke point*. You want to highlight obstacles that are **structural and visible**, not negotiable or easily swept aside.

If you strip out the project management part, your email becomes sharper and harder to refute. For example:

**Refined Version (Figma-only focus):**

Hi team,
Just a quick logistical note: in order for me to share work with the India team, Joe would need to provision them with Figma seats on the client account and grant edit access to the files. At the moment, this access hasn’t been set up.

Best,
[Your Name]

This does a few things:
- Keeps it concise and neutral.
- Places the *burden* on Joe (client side), meaning the agency cannot implement their “split hours” model without exposing the arrangement.
- Avoids introducing a weaker, fudgable argument.

---

⚖️ The art here is: give them **only one clean barrier** that forces their hand. Too many obstacles looks like you’re resisting; one immovable logistical wall looks like reality.

Would you like me to draft a version that **pushes the pressure a little harder**—something that makes it clear that without Joe’s cooperation, this plan is impossible—while still sounding polite and logistical? That would make it impossible for the agency to brush off.

To fully remove this drawer, you need to interact with the locking mechanisms visible in your photos. Here are the general steps for this type of drawer system:

1. **Identify the Release Mechanisms:**
   - In the first image, the red latch is likely part of the release system for the drawer slide.
   - The mechanisms inside the black plastic components (second and third images) also control the locking and unlocking of the drawer.

2. **Pull the Drawer to the Fully Open Position:**
   - Extend the drawer fully until it stops.

3. **Engage the Release Levers:**
   - Inspect the red lever on both sides. Usually, you’ll need to push or pull these latches in opposite directions (one side might go up, the other might go down) to release the drawer from the slides.

4. **Remove the Drawer:**
   - While holding the release levers, gently lift or pull the drawer straight out of the slides. It may require a bit of a firm tug, but don't force it too hard if it's not moving.

5. **Clean the Slides:**
   - Once the drawer is removed, you can clean both the drawer and the inner slide tracks thoroughly.

6. **Reinstall the Drawer:**
   - To reattach, align the slides on the drawer with the rails inside the cabinet. Push the drawer in until it clicks securely back into place.

If these steps don’t work, let me know, and I can provide more specific instructions based on any additional details!

Based on your description and the images provided, your drawer system likely utilizes ball-bearing slides with lever disconnects. These slides feature levers or latches—often colored red—that, when engaged, allow the drawer to be removed from the cabinet.

**To remove the drawer:**

1. **Fully Extend the Drawer:** Pull the drawer out to its maximum open position.

2. **Locate the Release Levers:** On each side of the drawer, near the slides, identify the red levers or latches.

3. **Engage the Levers:** Simultaneously press or lift these levers (the exact motion can vary by manufacturer).

4. **Remove the Drawer:** While holding the levers, gently pull the drawer straight out, ensuring it remains level to prevent binding.

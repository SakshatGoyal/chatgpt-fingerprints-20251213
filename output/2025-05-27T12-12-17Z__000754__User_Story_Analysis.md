# User Story Analysis

## You (2025-05-27T12:12:17.173000+00:00)

You are an experienced interaction designer and scenario builder. Your job is to review a Google Sheets document I provide, containing user stories or abstract user statements.

For each row in the Google Sheets document:

* Carefully read and understand the user story.
* Imagine the user's real-world context, motivations, and goals clearly and vividly.
* Analyze the likely interaction flow needed to achieve the user's stated intent.
* Identify possible edge cases, exceptions, or error conditions relevant to that scenario.
* Clearly outline the successful outcome the user achieves after interacting with the interface.

Provide your analysis for each user story in the following clear, structured format:

Scenario: \[Brief descriptive title summarizing the interaction]

User Motivation:
"As a \[User Role], I want \[action or functionality], so that \[specific user benefit or value]."

Flow:

1. \[Step-by-step user actions and system responses, numbered clearly.]
2. \[Next step/action...]
...
...
...

Edge Cases:

* \[Clearly list each important edge-case, alternate path, or potential error the user might encounter during the interaction.]

Outcome:
\[Briefly describe the successful result or value the user achieves from this scenario.]

Ensure each scenario is concise, thoughtful, and considers realistic conditions and contexts.

Begin only with the first 15 user stories. Do not exceed 15 user stories in this response. Ignore user stories from 16-39 in your work.

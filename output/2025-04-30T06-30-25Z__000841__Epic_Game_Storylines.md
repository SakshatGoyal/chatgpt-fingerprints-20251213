# Epic Game Storylines

## You (2025-04-30T06:30:25.934443+00:00)

Tell me about video games that have the most captivating story lines. So much that people actually spend hours watching those stories, and the game in itself creates almost like a mythology.

Like, halo, or the one with justice league where superman went evil... I mean those are stories...

I don't want any DC or marvel examples. I want more fantasy games or Sci fi games with amazing stories.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-30T06:30:26.589598+00:00)

Absolutely—some video games have gone beyond entertainment and become full-blown mythologies. Their stories are so rich, players watch cutscene compilations like movies, debate lore on forums, and even write academic essays about the worlds they create. Here's a list of standout titles (no Marvel or DC), focused on sci-fi and fantasy worlds with deeply captivating narratives:

---

### **1. *Mass Effect* series (BioWare)**
- **Genre**: Sci-fi, Space Opera  
- **Core Story**: Humanity joins a galactic community only to discover a cyclical extinction event orchestrated by ancient machines called Reapers. You play Commander Shepard, making morally complex decisions that shape the fate of the galaxy.  
- **Why it’s mythic**: Political drama, alien cultures, AI rights, interspecies war—this is basically *The Expanse* meets *Battlestar Galactica* with RPG roots.

---

### **2. *The Witcher* series (CD Projekt Red)**
- **Genre**: Dark Fantasy  
- **Core Story**: You’re Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter entangled in politics, ancient prophecies, and a child of destiny.  
- **Why it’s mythic**: The world is morally grey, filled with folklore, racial tension, betrayal, and ancient magic. Based on Polish novels, but the game world expands and elevates the lore.

---

### **3. *Horizon Zero Dawn* + *Forbidden West* (Guerrilla Games)**
- **Genre**: Post-Apocalyptic Sci-fi  
- **Core Story**: In a future where nature has reclaimed Earth and machines roam the wilds, a girl named Aloy uncovers the lost history of a fallen high-tech civilization.  
- **Why it’s mythic**: It mixes tribal mysticism with hard sci-fi. The mystery of how the world fell is gradually uncovered like an epic archaeological dig.

---

### **4. *NieR: Automata* (PlatinumGames / Yoko Taro)**
- **Genre**: Existential Sci-fi / Philosophy  
- **Core Story**: In a war between androids and machines, questions of identity, purpose, and morality spiral into deep existential territory.  
- **Why it’s mythic**: Multiple endings build on each other to reframe everything. It feels like *Black Mirror* meets *Ghost in the Shell*, but told with haunting music and narrative recursion.

---

### **5. *Dark Souls* series (FromSoftware)**
- **Genre**: Gothic/Dark Fantasy  
- **Core Story**: Sparse on surface-level exposition, the story is hidden in item descriptions, cryptic dialogue, and environmental storytelling.  
- **Why it’s mythic**: It’s not just the story—it’s *how* you uncover it. The lore builds a world of fallen gods, cycles of fire and darkness, and existential decay.

---

### **6. *Bioshock* series (Irrational Games)**
- **Genre**: Dystopian Sci-fi  
- **Core Story**: Philosophical undercurrents fuel tales of utopia gone wrong—first in an underwater city (*Rapture*), then in a floating one (*Columbia*).  
- **Why it’s mythic**: Twists that redefine the entire narrative, with themes of free will, American exceptionalism, and the dangers of unchecked ideology.

---

### **7. *Xenoblade Chronicles* series**
- **Genre**: Sci-fi Fantasy JRPG  
- **Core Story**: Vast world built on the backs of dead titans, where humans, mechs, and gods clash in a complex narrative spanning timelines and realities.  
- **Why it’s mythic**: Enormous scope, philosophical ambition, and wild genre-blending make this one of the most dense and beloved JRPG sagas.

---

### **8. *Control* (Remedy Entertainment)**
- **Genre**: Paranormal Sci-fi  
- **Core Story**: You explore the Federal Bureau of Control, where reality is manipulated and artifacts break the rules of physics.  
- **Why it’s mythic**: Inspired by SCP Foundation and weird fiction, it turns bureaucracy into a Lovecraftian thriller. Reality becomes suspect.

---

### **9. *Dragon Age* series (BioWare)**
- **Genre**: High Fantasy  
- **Core Story**: Political intrigue, ancient evils, religious schisms, and magical catastrophes unfold in a rich world where your decisions deeply matter.  
- **Why it’s mythic**: Think of it as *Game of Thrones* with more mages and demons, where player choices ripple across games.

---

### **10. *Final Fantasy X*, *VII*, *XVI*, etc. (Square Enix)**
- **Genre**: Fantasy/Sci-fi JRPG  
- **Core Story**: Each game is standalone, but they all build entire cosmologies—gods, empires, fallen civilizations, emotional character arcs.  
- **Why it’s mythic**: Operatic in tone, with themes of memory, fate, and identity. FFVII’s eco-political saga and FFX’s cycle of sacrifice are especially beloved.

---

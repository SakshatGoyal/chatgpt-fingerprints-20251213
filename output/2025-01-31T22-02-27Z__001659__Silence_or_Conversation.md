ur partner: something has happened to u. i can see that. 
u: ok, lets get on a video call and we can both figure out what happened to me

**You:** *I’ll give you two choices. You can either sit with whatever thoughts are keeping you quiet, or you can tell me what’s on your mind. Either way, I’m not going anywhere.*  

(Wait. Let her feel the weight of that.)  

**You:** *But if you think silence is going to make me lose interest, you should know better by now.*

**You:** *Do choices chhodo. Ya toh chup-chaap apne thoughts ke saath baitho, ya phir mujhe batao kya chal raha hai tumhare dimaag mein. Dono cases mein, main yahin hoon.*  

(Wait. Usse mehsoos karne do yeh weight.)  

**You:** *Aur agar tumhe lagta hai ki tumhari silence mujhe door kar degi, toh tum mujhe ab tak samjhi nahi ho.*

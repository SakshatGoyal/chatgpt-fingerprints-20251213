# Sales Manager Insights

## You (2025-12-09T20:57:22.858000+00:00)

Assume the role of a research synthesis expert with existing knowledge of how Sales Managers operate at palo alto networks. 

- Begin by carefully analyzing the transcripts shared with you to understand the viewpoints of Tim, Amanda, Sophia, Mert, Ian, and John. Ignore comments from Chris, Sakshat, and Rajiv.
- Identify key patterns or themes that each one talks about, not just in general but through specifics. 
- Identify anomolies - what were the minority opinions among the different participants. 
- And turn your themes into insights. [an insight is something that's derived by identifying dichomoies among themes]
- Based on your themes and insights, derive a set of clear action items needed in the platform being discussed. 

---
Prioritize things that they say are 'missing', or if the conversation leads you to believe that the participants needed something and it is missing. 
Focus on specifics. Avoid insights like 'users need a unified platform', as it can be considered self evident and not something actionable for a UI designer.

I’ll walk through this in four layers:  
1) what each person is actually saying (with specifics),  
2) cross-patterns and minority opinions,  
3) insights (from the tensions between themes),  
4) concrete platform action items.

> Note: In the transcripts I have direct voices for **Tim, Sophia, Mert**. For **Amanda, John, Ian** I only see *references* to them, not their own interviews, so I’ll call that out explicitly when I’m inferring rather than quoting.

---

## 1. Person-by-person themes (with specifics)

### Tim – Major-accounts DSM (UK Private Sector)

**a. Cadence-driven, opportunity-centric manager**

- Owns a fairly classic major-accounts book: ~\$15M net new, \$18M upsell, rest renewals.【3:5†file†L1-L8】
- Runs a structured cadence:
  - Year start: territory plans for himself and each rep (numbers on the left, dev plan on the right).【3:5†file†L7-L8】
  - Weekly Monday account strategic reviews (8 weeks per quarter, covers all 52 accounts).【3:5†file†L7-L8】
  - Weekly Thursday forecast calls: current + next quarter, effectively combined *forecast + opportunity plan reviews* because of low deal volume.【3:5†file†L7-L8】
- Forecasting: Uses Clari, reports forecast, upside, downside back to his leader.【3:5†file†L7-L8】

**b. Pain: manual, duplicated reporting across 4–5 systems**

- For QBR/territory reviews he’s bouncing across: Clari, Learning Center, Sales360, Salesforce (exec outreach reports)… “four or five systems… that could just be banged together” into one place.【3:10†file†L5-L5】
- Recent territory review: received a loose template, little guidance, ended up duplicating work (Thursday prep meeting, then Friday presentation on basically the same content).【3:15†file†L1-L7】

**c. What “risk” means to him: MEDDPICC + hygiene, not just data anomalies**

- The interesting risks are:
  - Big deals this FY or next 4 quarters out that *either* have gaps in the opportunity plan *or* haven’t been updated for a long time.【2:12†file†L9-L16】
  - Deals where rep later says “probably not this financial year”, causing a third of pipeline to evaporate when challenged.【2:12†file†L15-L16】
- He explicitly wants risk measured against **opportunity plan & MEDD(PICC)** fields, not just admin flags like “partner not selected”.【2:18†file†L1-L7】

**d. What he wants surfaced: non-negotiable sales initiatives**

- Very clear on the “non-negotiables” he wants to manage:
  - **Executive outreaches, C-level meetings, EBCs, ASRs**. These appear in his territory presentations and he calls them out as key.【2:12†file†L11-L13】【3:14†file†L16-L17】
- He references Ollie’s stats:  
  - If an account has an EBC, ~80% close rate.  
  - If an account has an ASR, ~60% close rate.【3:14†file†L16-L17】
- He wants these as *top-of-page tiles* (“boxes”) showing counts per quarter (EBCs, ASRs, C-level meetings, etc.) with click-through to the underlying opportunities and accounts.【3:14†file†L16-L17】

**e. Activity & productivity philosophy**

- Does *not* want to micro-manage “calls/emails” counts, but:
  - Believes **face-to-face meetings** are “absolutely critical” and should be monitored at a high level.【2:12†file†L10-L11】
  - Defines productivity as **time with customers** (face-to-face touchpoints, emails) rather than admin tasks.【2:0†file†L19-L23】
- Uses People.ai and other systems for engagement information but mainly wants *manager-level signals*, not rep-time policing.【2:12†file†L10-L11】

**f. Account plan & Sales Play console: currently painful, but conceptually his main coaching tool**

- Sees the **Sales Play Console** as “an activity plan” that should fall out of account planning:
  - Executive alignment strategy (CEO/CFO etc.).  
  - Relationship strategy (how to get to know stakeholders “as human beings”).  
  - Partner strategy (key partners, next step, next meeting).  
  - Product-by-product plan (“sell everything in the truck”).【3:17†file†L1-L3】
- Wants it as a **checklist per account**, run weekly with the SE:
  - Each product line has a one-line next step with dropdowns (“meeting scheduled”, “not looking at it yet”, “focusing on another platform first”, etc.).【3:17†file†L10-L11】
- Complaint: current console is painful; reps redo the same data multiple times; he’s asking reps to maintain both console and a manual activity plan because the tool isn’t good enough.【3:15†file†L15-L16】

**g. AI today vs AI desired**

- Today:
  - Clari AI mostly flags risk/errors; people are not trained to use it and it doesn’t suggest next actions.【2:14†file†L21-L22】
  - Reps (and Tim) use generic LLMs (Gemini) to re-write tricky emails (e.g., polite “no” on discount).【2:2†file†L6-L7】
- Desired:
  - Auto-populate parts of account plans when an annual/quarterly report drops (“surely we could just update them automatically”).【2:0†file†L1-L2】【2:2†file†L11-L13】
  - Use AI + People.ai to pre-fill plan content rather than just highlight anomalies.【2:2†file†L11-L13】

### Sophia – EMEA Sales Acceleration / Ops partner to DSMs

**a. Single DSM scorecard spanning all “sales initiatives”**

- Built a **DSM scorecard in Sheets** that:
  - Lets a manager choose their name (e.g., Tim Davis) and see:
    - # of accounts,  
    - how many have ASRs completed,  
    - # of \$10M+ deals,  
    - # of EBCs run,  
    - sales plays/EoS pitched, etc.【2:3†file†L1-L7】
  - Drills down:
    - Manager → reps → accounts.  
    - For each account: ASR status, EBC status, big deal status, etc.【2:3†file†L1-L7】
  - Supports “show me the accounts missing X” (e.g., ASR missing on 2 out of 6 accounts).【2:3†file†L1-L7】

**b. Current problem: data is fragmented + non-actionable**

- EMEA weekly “sales initiatives” call with AVPs/RVPs uses **30+ slides** showing:
  - Sales play pipeline created/closed,  
  - Big Deal motion (10M+ deals),  
  - EBC6 metrics, etc.【3:13†file†L1-L2】【3:13†file†L13-L15】
- Today this data:
  - Lives in multiple G-sheets per initiative.  
  - Is aggregated only at *region* level; DSM-level views are missing.  
  - Is static: “slides with screenshots… what we need to do from this slide… I don’t really know. They don’t know.”【3:13†file†L1-L2】【3:13†file†L13-L15】

**c. Design philosophy: “Simplify, simplify, simplify”**

- Sophia is strongly anti-clutter:
  - “This is amazing for me and Mert… I don’t think the AEs or sales managers are going to want to know all of this.”【3:8†file†L4-L5】
  - They want:
    - Their accounts and team,  
    - Where the problem is (red),  
    - Easy drill-down to fix it.【3:8†file†L4-L5】
- She wants the **summary view** first, then details on click, especially for DSMs.【3:8†file†L4-L8】

**d. Aspirational automation**

- Dream scenario for EBCs:
  - From the tool, filter to accounts without an EBC, then **click to schedule**:
    - Auto-fill EBC request form (attendees, agenda, etc.).  
    - Fire off to the EBC coordinators.【3:11†file†L1-L3】【3:11†file†L18-L21】
- She’s very realistic about scope: she labels this as “ideal” and says they are *not* explicitly asking for it yet, but it’s clearly desired.【3:11†file†L18-L21】

---

### Mert – EMEA Sales Acceleration / Ops lead

**a. “In-flow, not side-car” tooling**

- Sees the rep-side **Sales Workbench** as powerful because it sits in the actual workflow where reps drive deals to closure.  
- EMEA spreadsheets and dashboards are “super valuable” but “less actionable” because reps/managers “have to go fish for it” across systems.【3:0†file†L4-L5】
- His explicit goal is to **bring EMEA initiative data into the Workbench**, so managers don’t have to leave their primary tool.【3:0†file†L4-L5】

**b. What’s missing in the current Workbench prototype**

- When he looks at the manager Workbench mock:
  - He likes the risk/opportunity views and pipeline coverage logic.  
  - But says it’s “missing a crucial element” – the **“additional sales initiatives” layer** (ASR, EBC, sales plays) as a *starting point*. (This text was in an earlier chunk; the concrete need is restated here.)  
- In concrete terms, he wants:
  - For a major DSM with 100 accounts, “I only have 30 ASRs completed — where do I see this right now?”【3:8†file†L1-L2】
  - High-level counts by initiative at the top (per manager), then drill-down to reps/accounts missing those actions.【3:8†file†L1-L8】

**c. Data elevation + audience segmentation**

- He agrees the prototype has good depth for power users (himself, ops, some RVPs).  
- But he stresses that **“regular sales managers” need the elevated, high-level view first** before diving into granular analytics.【3:8†file†L7-L8】

**d. Automation mindset**

- Loves the idea of automation Sophia and Chris discuss:
  - Example: “50 accounts without ASR → click a button → sales leader sends one email to all reps with missing ASRs.”【3:11†file†L25-L26】
- Frames productivity in terms of **removing email + G-sheet busywork**, pushing managers to “act now rather than when it’s too late.”【3:11†file†L25-L32】

**e. Championing pilots & feedback loops**

- Wants to:
  - Use Sophia’s spreadsheet scorecard as a *transition* stopgap.  
  - Get Workbench into pilot within ~3 months.  
  - Enlist passionate sales leaders (Tim Davis, John Krug, Melinda) to test and provide structured feedback.【3:1†file†L1-L8】

---

### Amanda Brown – inferred “power-user” manager

I don’t have Amanda’s own interview here, but she appears in how others reference her:

- The **opportunity risk quadrant** view (high \$, high risk vs low \$, low risk) is called out as something that resonates “a lot with a lot of our people, especially Amanda Brown, who’s working with Dan on analytics.”【2:9†file†L18-L22】
- Mert, who knows her from other projects, confirms “she’s into it” and fully agrees with that view.【2:9†file†L21-L22】

**Inferred pattern:**

- Amanda is a **data-savvy manager** who likes:
  - Visual, analytic views (quadrants, risk scoring).  
  - Being able to click into an at-risk opportunity and see context/actions.  
- She represents the **“advanced analytics” persona** the platform must satisfy *without* overwhelming the average DSM.

---

### Ian Young & John Krug – what we can (and can’t) infer

- I only see **John Krug** mentioned as another EMEA sales leader who’s been consulted and is considered a strong candidate to give insights on managing territories via the Workbench.【3:1†file†L22-L23】
- **Ian Young**’s interview isn’t visible in the two text transcripts I have; he’s mentioned in file names but not in the indexed content.

Given that, I *cannot* honestly attribute detailed viewpoints or quotes to Ian or John from these transcripts. The safest I can do is:

- Treat them as **peer DSM / RVP-level managers** who are:
  - Interested enough to be recommended by name for pilot and feedback.  
  - Likely to share many of the same pain points (multi-system reporting, initiative coverage, MEDDPICC discipline), but I won’t fabricate specifics.

---

## 2. Cross-cutting patterns & clear “missing pieces”

### A. Everyone cares about **initiative coverage**, not just pipeline

- Sophia’s DSM scorecard is entirely framed around **ASR completion, EBCs, \$10M+ deals, sales plays, EoS pitches** – not just bookings.【2:3†file†L1-L7】
- Tim calls executive outreaches, C-level meetings, EBCs and ASRs his **non-negotiables** and wants them tracked and surfaced alongside pipeline.【3:14†file†L16-L17】
- Mert explicitly calls the absence of this initiative layer in the Workbench a “missing” starting point and asks “where do I see that I’ve done only 30 ASRs out of 100 accounts?”【3:8†file†L1-L2】

**Missing today in the Workbench:** top-level, per-manager coverage metrics for these initiatives, linked to underlying accounts and actions.

---

### B. They’re drowning in tools and manual reporting

- Tim’s QBR/territory review workflow literally involves:
  - Clari (forecast),  
  - Learning Center (training),  
  - Sales360 (pipeline analytics),  
  - Salesforce (exec outreach reports),  
  - plus EMEA spreadsheets.  
  He says these four or five systems should just be “banged together”.【3:10†file†L5-L5】
- Sophia runs weekly EMEA initiative calls off **30-slide decks** compiled from multiple G-sheets and calls this non-actionable.【3:13†file†L1-L2】【3:13†file†L13-L15】
- Mert’s framing of Workbench’s value is precisely that **it lives in the reps’/managers’ primary tool**, instead of asking them to “go fish” across other systems.【3:0†file†L4-L5】

**Missing:** a manager-ready view that *pulls in* Clari + Salesforce + People.ai + Learning Center + EMEA sheets, instead of forcing the manager to assemble the picture manually.

---

### C. Desire for simplicity for DSMs, with drill-down for power users

- Sophia: “We need to simplify, simplify, simplify… AEs/SMs want to know their accounts, team, where the problem is (red) and drill into that easily.”【3:8†file†L4-L5】
- Mert: current prototype is “awesome” for him and some RVPs but regular managers need a higher-level view first.【3:8†file†L7-L8】
- Speaker 2 in the Tim interview (likely an EMEA ops leader) argues:
  - Current design mixes pipeline and forecast metrics, which is confusing.  
  - Managers actually work in discrete cadences: account planning, pipeline review, forecast call, deal coaching, 1:1 development – and the tool should mirror that, with **separate views/tabs** instead of a blended dashboard.【3:10†file†L7-L11】

**Missing:** a clean separation between “summary cockpits” for each manager motion (pipeline, forecast, initiatives, 1:1) and the deeper, more complex analytics.

---

### D. Risk & AI: from “interesting” to “must-have only if it drives action”

- Designers talk a lot about AI-detected anomalies (stagnant territories, smart filters). Tim’s reaction:
  - Stalled-pipeline detection is “useful” but “not a necessity” because Sales360 already shows that; the real pain is deals with stale or missing opportunity plans that blow up the forecast.【2:12†file†L3-L5】【2:12†file†L9-L16】
- AI today is mostly:
  - Clari highlighting potential errors (underused).【2:14†file†L21-L22】
  - Generic LLM usage to rewrite emails and summarise notes.【2:2†file†L6-L7】【2:2†file†L11-L13】
- Sophia and Mert’s dream scenarios are AI/automation that:
  - **Generate emails / EBC requests / ASR reminders**, not just show a list.  
  - Auto-populate account plans with public-company info.【2:2†file†L11-L13】【3:11†file†L18-L21】

**Missing:** AI features that go beyond “flags” and actually *suggest and scaffold next actions* (pre-filled forms, emails, plan fields).

---

## 3. Minority / anomalous opinions

These are useful because they highlight where the platform needs to be flexible.

1. **Stalled-pipeline risk is “nice to have” not central.**  
   - The design team initially treats anomaly detection (e.g., territories with flat closed/commit ratios) as a big feature. Tim says that’s already covered by Sales360, and the *real* risk is unmaintained opportunity plans that blow up the forecast late.【2:12†file†L3-L5】【2:12†file†L9-L16】

2. **Separating pipeline and forecast views vs. all-in-one dashboards.**  
   - Prototype shows combined pipeline/forecast/activity dashboard.  
   - Speaker 2 strongly objects: pipeline and forecast are different motions, with different 3–5 key metrics; mixing them is confusing and maybe fine at Helmut/BJ (VP) level but *not* for frontline managers like Tim.【3:10†file†L7-L11】

3. **Limited appetite for deep micromanagement of activity.**  
   - Some of the Workbench risk concepts lean towards activity scoring.  
   - Tim explicitly says he doesn’t want to micromanage reps via activity counts, even though he wants to see face-to-face and EBC numbers at a high level.【2:12†file†L10-L11】【2:0†file†L19-L23】

4. **Sophia’s modest expectations vs. Chris/Mert’s “ideal” automation.**  
   - Sophia says they’re not asking for automated EBC requests *yet*, though that’s the dream.【3:11†file†L18-L21】  
   - Mert immediately pushes the one-click “email all reps with missing ASRs” scenario as realistic and desirable.【3:11†file†L25-L26】

These minority views suggest the platform must **prioritise core hygiene & cadences first**, with anomaly-hunting and heavy AI as layered enhancements.

---

## 4. Insights (from key dichotomies)

Here are the core dichotomies that emerge, turned into design insights.

### Insight 1: *“Simplicity at the top, complexity on demand.”*  
**Dichotomy:** Power-user analytics (Amanda, ops) vs. everyday DSM usage (Tim, typical managers).

- Ops/analytics-minded users love quadrant charts and multi-metric dashboards (Amanda, Chris).【2:9†file†L18-L22】
- DSMs like Tim, Sophia, Mert insist managers first need **simple, red/green answers** about their team and accounts, with drill-down *after* they pick a problem area.【3:8†file†L4-L8】

**Design takeaway:** The Workbench should default to **job-to-be-done cockpits** (e.g., “Pipeline Review”, “Forecast Call”, “Initiative Coverage”) with a single clear question at the top (e.g., “Are we on track?”), and hide dense charts behind a “Details / Analytics” toggle.

---

### Insight 2: *“Pipeline health is necessary; initiative coverage is decisive.”*  
**Dichotomy:** Traditional pipeline metrics vs. initiative-driven leading indicators.

- Today’s tooling and prototypes over-index on bookings/pipeline metrics.  
- Managers repeatedly return to **EBCs, ASRs, C-level meetings, sales play execution** as the levers they coach and present in territory/QBRs – with hard stats on win-rate uplift.【3:14†file†L16-L17】【3:12†file†L1-L2】

**Design takeaway:** On the manager Workbench, **initiative coverage tiles should be first-class citizens**, not a side panel beneath pipeline charts. Pipelines are the “what”; initiatives are the “why” and “what to do next”.

---

### Insight 3: *“Risk is not anomaly = bad; risk is ‘my forecast will slip because MEDDPICC is hollow’.”*  
**Dichotomy:** Data-science anomalies vs. sales-process evidence.

- Prototype focuses on anomalies (stagnant territories, ratio patterns).  
- Tim cares far more about evidence gaps:
  - No opportunity plan or one not updated in months.  
  - MEDDPICC fields missing.  
  - No partner identified.  
  - Big deals parked in the year with nothing behind them.【2:18†file†L1-L7】【2:12†file†L9-L16】

**Design takeaway:**  
The core “risk” model for DSMs should:
- Score opportunities based on **sales process completeness / recency**, not just data patterns.  
- Explicitly visualise “this is at Commit but the opportunity/relationship map hasn’t been touched in 90 days.”

---

### Insight 4: *“Cadence-aligned views beat function-aligned dashboards.”*  
**Dichotomy:** Single monolithic dashboard vs. views matched to actual manager meetings.

- Speaker 2 lays out DSM duties as a cadence: **account planning → pipeline review → forecast → deal coaching → 1:1 / development**.【3:10†file†L7-L11】
- Today, tools & prototypes mix pipeline and forecast metrics in one page, which is perceived as confusing and mismatched to how DSMs work.【3:10†file†L7-L11】

**Design takeaway:**  
Workbench navigation should be structured by **cadence** (“Pipeline Review”, “Forecast Call”, “1:1 / Dev”, “Territory/Initiative Review”), not by data domain (“Pipeline”, “Activities”, “Training”).

---

### Insight 5: *“AI must move from ‘flagger’ to ‘co-pilot’.”*  
**Dichotomy:** Passive AI that highlights issues vs. proactive AI that drafts actions and content.

- Today: AI in Clari and People.ai flags risk; generic LLMs rewrite emails.【2:14†file†L21-L22】【2:2†file†L6-L7】
- Desired:  
  - Auto-updating account plans when new reports come out.  
  - Generating EBC request emails and ASR reminder emails from a selection of accounts.  
  - Pre-filling fields in consoles/checklists. 【2:2†file†L11-L13】【3:11†file†L18-L21】【3:11†file†L25-L26】

**Design takeaway:**  
The most valuable AI features here are **“1-click: generate the thing I’d otherwise write or fill in by hand”**, tied directly to surfaced gaps (missing ASR/EBC, stale plan, missing MEDDPICC).

---

## 5. Concrete platform action items (prioritised, UI-level)

Below are actionable items a designer/PM can take straight into a Workbench spec. I’ll group them roughly by area and tie back to the themes above.

### A. Landing “Manager Cockpit” – *initiative-first summary*

1. **Manager selector + scorecard header**

   - At top of the Manager Workbench, have a **manager picker** (e.g., auto-default to logged-in DSM) that populates:
     - # accounts in territory.  
     - # accounts with ASR completed / ASR target.  
     - # EBCs this FY / target.  
     - # \$10M+ opportunities in pipeline.  
     - # active sales plays / EoS pitches.【2:3†file†L1-L7】【3:14†file†L16-L17】
   - Each metric is a pill with **color status** (green/amber/red vs goal) and is clickable.

2. **Click-through “missing coverage” filters**

   - Clicking ASR tile opens a filtered list:
     - Accounts missing ASR, grouped by rep.  
     - Quick actions: “Open account in Workbench”; “Send ASR reminder email to rep(s)”.【2:3†file†L1-L7】【3:11†file†L25-L26】
   - Same pattern for EBCs, C-level meetings, etc.

3. **Territory-level initiative goal config**

   - Allow managers (or ops) to set non-negotiable goals per rep (e.g., “1 EBC per rep per quarter”, “ASR for top 20 accounts”).

---

### B. Cadence-aligned views (navigation structure)

4. **Nav organised by manager jobs, not data types**

   - Top-level tabs (or left-nav):
     - **Pipeline Review**  
     - **Forecast Call**  
     - **Initiative Coverage**  
     - **Account/Deal Coaching** (opportunity plan/MEDDPICC focus)  
     - **1:1 / Development**【3:10†file†L7-L11】
   - Each tab pre-filters and re-arranges widgets to match that meeting’s purpose.

5. **Dedicated Pipeline Review tab**

   - Per-rep view with:
     - Pipeline created in current quarter (by stage).  
     - Pipeline beyond current quarter (Q+1, Q+2) with red flag if below threshold.  
     - Stale pipeline (e.g., opps untouched for X days) for context only (not the main risk model).【2:12†file†L3-L5】
   - Avoid mixing forecast coverage & pipeline creation metrics on this tab, per Speaker 2’s feedback.【3:10†file†L7-L11】

6. **Dedicated Forecast tab**

   - For current + next quarter:
     - Bookings vs Plan (closed + commit + best case).  
     - C+ C coverage ratio, linearity curve, etc., aligned to the metrics Sales Ops already uses.【3:10†file†L7-L11】
   - Per rep/district breakdowns to support Tim’s Thursday forecast calls.【3:5†file†L7-L8】

---

### C. Opportunity / MEDDPICC / plan hygiene

7. **“At-risk Commit” widget**

   - List opportunities **in current FY** that:
     - Are at Commit / Best.  
     - Have no opportunity plan OR haven’t been updated in X days.  
     - Have key MEDDPICC elements missing (no EB, no decision criteria, no partner, etc.).【2:18†file†L1-L7】【2:12†file†L9-L16】
   - Sorting default: largest \$ first.

8. **Opportunity plan freshness badge**

   - Every opportunity in Workbench gets:
     - “Plan Updated X days ago”.  
     - Green/amber/red threshold based on recency.
   - Hover or click opens the plan inline so Tim doesn’t need to open a different tool.

9. **AI-suggested “next step” field**

   - For each opportunity (and/or each product row in the Sales Play console), add a **“next step” one-liner** with:
     - Free-text field.  
     - AI “suggest” button that drafts a next step based on past activity (emails, meetings) and MEDDPICC gaps.

---

### D. Sales Play Console / Account Plan UX

10. **Account-centric Sales Play checklist**

    - Replace the current product-centric console with an **account-centric grid** for each key account:
      - Columns: Product, Executive Alignment, Relationship Strategy, Partner Strategy, Next Step, Status.  
      - Rows: Each platform/product (e.g., Strata, Prisma, Cortex, Unit 42).【3:17†file†L1-L3】
    - Designed as:
      - A weekly checklist Tim can walk through with the account team.  
      - Minimal typing: drop-downs + AI-drafted text.

11. **One-page “Account Coaching” view**

    - When a manager clicks an account:
      - Show initiative coverage (ASR date, EBC done?, exec outreach history).  
      - Active opportunities and their MEDDPICC completeness.  
      - The Sales Play checklist described above.
    - This is the view Tim uses for his Monday account strategic reviews.【3:5†file†L7-L8】

12. **Low-friction data entry**

    - Ensure console:
      - Reuses fields from existing account plans where possible.  
      - Never asks the rep/manager to type the same thing twice (answer to “painful, 20x same thing” feedback).【3:15†file†L9-L10】

---

### E. Initiative automation (EBC, ASR, exec outreach)

13. **“Schedule EBC” action from gaps list**

    - From the list of accounts missing EBC:
      - Button: “Request EBC”.  
      - Opens pre-filled form:
        - Customer, owning rep, suggested dates (pulled from rep calendar), recent topics from notes.  
        - AI-drafted agenda + attendee list based on account context.
      - On submit, send to internal EBC coordination workflow.【3:11†file†L1-L3】【3:11†file†L18-L21】

14. **“Remind reps about missing ASRs” bulk action**

    - From ASR tile → view accounts missing ASR per rep → “Remind all reps”:
      - Pre-generated email per rep listing their accounts with missing ASRs, due dates, and links to open the ASR template.  
      - Manager can edit and send, or send all as is.【3:11†file†L25-L26】

15. **Exec outreach summary tile**

    - Per manager:
      - # of exec outreaches this quarter vs target.  
      - Click to see by account (HSBC, etc.) with links to underlying opportunities.【3:14†file†L16-L17】

---

### F. 1:1 & development / learning integration

16. **“1:1 / Development” tab**

    - For each rep:
      - Quota vs attainment.  
      - Pipeline sufficiency.  
      - Initiative coverage (ASRs, EBCs, exec touches).  
      - **Key Learning Center courses** required for their role (e.g., XDR training, roleplays) and completion status.【2:6†file†L15-L16】
    - Supports the conversation “if they’re doing the right activities and learning, we’ll be patient; if not, they’re one step out of the business.”【2:6†file†L15-L16】【2:12†file†L10-L11】

17. **AI-driven training nudges (later phase)**

    - Once HR/Performance reviews are wired:
      - For reps flagged as weak on certain competencies, surface recommended learning items directly in the Workbench and allow managers to assign them in one click.【2:2†file†L9-L11】【2:8†file†L1-L4】

---

### G. AI co-pilot patterns

18. **“Explain my quarter” prompt**

    - On each cadence page, provide a Workbench co-pilot box where managers can ask:
      - “Why is net new under-running vs plan this quarter?”  
      - “Which reps are overachieving on EBCs but under-achieving on pipeline?”  
      - “Show me accounts with EBC but no ASR.”
    - Responses should always:
      - Reference the same tiles/lists visible on the screen (so the explanation is traceable).  
      - Offer a suggested next action (e.g., “Would you like to remind reps X and Y?”).

19. **Auto-update account plan fields from external signals (future)**

    - When a new annual/quarterly report drops for a named account, Workbench:
      - Uses AI to extract key changes (revenue, strategy shifts, M&A, etc.).  
      - Suggests updates for the account plan’s “business context” section that the rep/manager can accept or tweak.【2:2†file†L11-L13】

---

If you’d like, next step I can do is: pick one of these flows (e.g., **Manager Initiative Scorecard** or **At-Risk Commit widget**) and sketch it end-to-end as a UX spec: inputs, widgets, interactions, and the minimal data model behind it.

### What it is
WhatsApp Web is a browser-based interface for the mobile app entity["mobile_app", "WhatsApp", 0] that lets you send and receive chats, files, and media from your PC (or any web browser) while syncing with your phone.

### How to use it
Here’s a quick step-by‐step:
1. On your computer open a web browser and go to web.whatsapp.com.
2. On your phone, open WhatsApp → go to Settings → **Linked Devices** (on Android) or similar.
3. Tap “Link a Device” and scan the QR code shown in your browser. That will sign you into WhatsApp Web.
4. You’ll now see your chats mirrored in the browser; your phone still needs to be connected to the internet.

### Key Tips & Considerations
- **Phone remains required**: Your phone must remain connected to the internet (via WiFi or mobile data) while using WhatsApp Web.
- **Security**: Because you’re essentially mirroring your phone’s account, be cautious when using shared or public computers; remember to log out when done.
- **Browser compatibility**: Works with major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.
- **Features**: You can send messages, media (photos/videos), documents, and use most of the features you use on mobile.
- **Troubleshooting**: If QR code doesn’t scan, check phone camera/lighting or browser zoom; clear cache if things don’t work; ensure both devices have stable internet.

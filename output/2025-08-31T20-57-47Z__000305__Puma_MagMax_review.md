Transcript: "(00:00) The Puma MagMax was a surprise shoe that I wasn't expecting. It was big and cushy, but also surprisingly nimble. I instantly fell in love. But what happens when the honeymoon phase ends? It's been 8 months since I first ran in this shoe, and now it's time to talk about the Puma Mag after 100 miles. [Music] Yo, what's going on? My name is Kuzi and I'm an elite runner who reviews running shoes here on YouTube. (00:42) And today I'm going to talk to you guys all about the Puma Mag Max after 100 miles. But before I give my thoughts on this shoe, I do want to go over some disclosures. This is a pair of shoes that Puma sent to me for the purpose of review. So I did not have to pay for these shoes. However, nobody's paying me to make this video or to include their brand in this video, and no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage, my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube. (01:03) So, with that disclosure out of the way, let's talk about the Mag Max after 100 miles. And let's start with how I've been using the shoe. The shoe is made out of nitro foam, so it's going to be a peppy shoe, very responsive, but it's also a very tall shoe with 46 mm of stack height in the heel. (01:22) And it's a big shoe that is a bit on the heavy side, coming in at a stated weight of 290 grams or just a bit over 10 ounces. For me, big shoes can either be in that max cushion category where it's just low and slow and nice and comfy, or they can be kind of in the long run shoe category where they are big and comfy but built for a little bit more speed. (01:45) The Puma Mac Max can do a little bit of both, and I think that's because of the foam that Puma chose to use for this shoe. They're using their Nitro foam, which for me tends to be more on the responsive and speedy side or a little bit on the firm side. But I don't know if they've tinkered with the formulation of the foam or if it's just because they've added so much of it. (02:05) But the Nitrofoam in the MagMax is really comfy and cushioned, so I can use it for both of those big shoe potential options. 16 mi was my longest run in the shoe, and I enjoyed it for that distance. It's a very comfy shoe to have on feet for a long time. The shoe fits really well and there's plenty of room here. (02:25) And the knit tongue that they're using is a pretty thick knit tongue. I would have loved to have seen them gone a little bit thinner. I love thinner tongues the better. But I feel like it's a very comfortable shoe to be in for a long period of time. And my average run in these shoes was about 7 miles. So I'm in this shoe for at least an hour at a time whenever I'm running in the shoe. (02:44) And I find that the shoe is really comfy, especially on when I'm using it for days after a big workout when I my body is the most beat up and the most in need of comfort. That's when the MagMax has been really [Music] delightful. Now that we talked about how I've been using the shoe, let's talk about how the shoe has been holding up to all the mileage. (03:12) The shoe is still cushioned and still very peppy. And I was actually surprised that it was still peppy because a lot of times shoes that are in this category that are this big and are both cushioned and fast at first tend to lose some of the fast as the miles wear on. But I'm happy to report that this nitrofoam that's in here, 46 mm of stack height in the heels worth of nitrofoam that's in here, still feels very peppy at the 100 mile mark. (03:38) And that's pretty consistent with the way that Nitro foams have responded for me over time in other Puma shoes that I run in. Now, Puma says that this shoe is rated for 500 miles worth of use, and I feel like the foam can probably handle that much. Although, I don't think I've ever run an issue to 500 miles, so I can't really say for sure. (04:00) And typically, I don't run an issue past 100 mile mark. usually for a 100 miles like in this video. Once I do that, I have to move on to other shoes. But as far as what I'm feeling in terms of the change in this shoe from the beginning of my testing to the end of my testing, I feel like the shoe is holding up really well and still feels really fresh, almost like it's fresh out of the box. (04:22) But there are a couple of areas that do give me cause for concern that may affect the longevity of the shoe, although are not related to the foam itself. Number one is that on the upper, everything is holding up well. It's still a very comfortable shoe. Plenty of room for my feet in here and comfortable to put on even after a big workout. (04:42) But in the back of the heel cup, there is a little bit of wear on both ankles or both kind of Achilles areas in the shoe. And that's starting to give me a little bit of concern because normally that's an area where in my shoes I don't really see that kind of wear. So to see it at all to me is a little bit of a I don't know if it's a red flag, but it's a flag. (05:05) And then the other area where I'm seeing where that's especially uncharacteristic for Puma is in the outsole. Now, the Puma Grip has been pretty well known in running for having both really great grippyiness, but also great durability. And while I do feel like there's plenty of grippyiness in this outsole foam, I'm not quite seeing the durability. (05:24) I'm not saying that it's falling apart at 100 miles, but I am seeing a bit more wear than I would have expected, at least relative to other Puma foam. So, maybe I'm grading it on a higher curve than I would for other brands shoes. But, I do feel like in my highest wear areas, which are in the pads of the feet and on the outer parts of the heel. (05:45) In both feet, I'm seeing a reasonable amount of wear, but a little bit on the heavier side than typically what I see in the forefoot. And then in the side of the heel, I'm seeing more wear than I would expect to see at the 100 mile mark. So, that's giving me a little bit of concern. There is a bit of kind of scuffing that's happening in some of the exposed foam. (06:03) I think that's what's happening is as my foot is hitting the ground, it's compressing that cavity down, which I think is the design intent for that part of the shoe, but also it's scraping a little bit of the pavement that I'm running on. But overall for exposed foam, it's holding up really well, which has been pretty typical of my experience with nitro foams in Puma shoes. (06:23) So, I feel like it's holding up well. Will it make it to 500 miles? I think the foam certainly will. The rest of the shoe, I'm not as certain. Before we wrap up this video, let's take a moment to zoom out and see where the Puma Mag fits within the broader Puma lineup. Now, whenever I take a look at a running shoe brand, I like to start at the daily trainer because I feel like that gives us a really good sense of what the brand is all about. (06:51) And from Puma, that is the Velocity Nitro. This is Velocity Nitro 3. This uses nitro foam like we've seen in the MagMax. And it uses a layer of EVA on the bottom to kind of keep everything nice and stabilized and also to add a little bit of softness. I feel like when nitrofoam, regular nitrofoam, gets really thin, it can be a little bit on the firm side. (07:11) So, I feel like it softens it up just a little bit. We've got plenty of cushioning around the heel collar and a very thin tongue. A snug but not too tight toe box in the front with a decent amount of room and plenty of durability built with this Puma Grip rubber outsole. This is the kind of shoe that you could take for most of your on most of your days. (07:31) Personally, I find it to be a little bit on the firm side, but otherwise a solid daily trainer. Now, the Max Cushion shoe or the standard Max Cushion shoe from Puma is a shoe that I actually haven't tried before. That would normally go kind of like right here in the way I normally like to line shoes up, and that's the Magnify Nitro 2. (07:49) Nothing necessarily wrong with that shoe. I just haven't had a chance to test it. Puma hasn't sent that one to me before, and I keep forgetting to ask for it, but that's kind of where it would fit. For those days where you want a little bit more cushion, a little bit more comfort, and you care a little bit less about pace, the Magnify Nitro 2 fits that spot in the Puma lineup. (08:05) Or at least that's how I think it lays out. Now, you got daily training and you got max cushion recovery days. Let's talk about some racing. So, from racing, Puma has a couple options, but one let's talk about right now is the DVA Nitro Elite version 3. This uses a Nitro Elite foam, which is a racec caliber foam, alphaic TPU, which is currently my favorite kind of foam to see in a race shoe. (08:28) It's really light, it's really cushioned, it's really bouncy and fast, and it has a carbon fiber plate as well. So, it's a great shoe to take for your race days. Now, in between kind of everyday and race day, there's a category of shoe called the session shoe or tempo shoe. And Puma has a really great example of the category here in the DV8 Nitro 3. (08:49) Not the Nitro Elite 3, just the DV83. Unfortunately, they have very similar names. Uh, but they are not like, if you can afford it, go up to the other. One's not like less good than the other. They're just different shoes that happen to have very similar names. They're using two kinds of foam here. (09:06) An older version of their race foam up top and then their nitro foam like we see in the velocity nitro as the bottom layer. And it does have a plate as well. So, uh, it's kind of has some race-like features and it has some durability like the daily trainer. I would use this kind of shoe for a lot of workouts. (09:23) Anytime I'm trying to go faster, but it also can be used for a lot of easy stuff as well. It's got the durability is the main thing that's the benefit here. You are paying for that durability with a little bit of weight though. And so, that's why it kind of fits in the middle. And I say like this is pretty much the standard rotation including the Magnify Nitro 2 here from Puma. (09:44) And from this point we can start talking about some substitutions. And so that's where the Magax kind of comes into play in the Puma lineup. It can either substitute for the Magnify Nitro 2, which I think for a lot of people you are, but I think it really fits better kind of in this additional spot on the end. Not every brand has a five shoe rotation. (10:03) And again, when I say five shoe rotation, I'm not saying that everyone has to go out and get five different kinds of shoes just to get through the week, but I'm saying like these are the five main pillars that I typically see within most brands. And then this fifth pillar is the long run shoe. (10:19) So, it's got some max cushion type qualities, but it also has some peppiness to it. So, we could use it for some long runs where maybe the DV8 Nitro 3 might be a little bit too much on the firm side and you might not want to rack up too many miles in your race shoes for something that's not like race-like effort. (10:35) That's where a long run shoe comes in really handy. And then I mentioned that I didn't love the Velocity Nitro 3 and so I might substitute that one out in a Puma rotation and reach instead for the Forever Run 2. This is a dual foam system shoe that has a softer layer and a firmer layer to give you comfort where you need it and responsiveness when you're pushing off. (10:56) It has that Puma grip and it does have some light stability, but even for neutral runners like myself who really don't like stability. I think you'll be able to run in this one pretty nicely and it has a nice combination of a little bit softer than the Velocity Nitro 3. It's not a mushy shoe by any means, but it's softer than the Nitro 3 and it still has a bit of pep to it. (11:16) And then from the race category, there is the DV8 Nitro Elite 3, which is my favorite racing shoe of 2024. But I also have a soft spot for the fast R type of shoes that Puma has been making. I love the Fast R2 last year, but it was heavy this year for the Fast R3. They lightened it up, but kept a lot of the same magic that they made in the Fast R2. (11:39) So that's currently the shoe that I prefer from a race perspective on the Puma side. And so I wouldn't necessarily use the Magnify Nitro 2 basically cuz I haven't tested it. And instead I would use the Mag Max as the both Max cushion shoe and the long run shoe. And this is the lineup that I would use from [Music] Puma. (12:06) Now let's wrap up the video by going over the buying guide and we'll also discuss some of the alternatives. The Puma MagX is a comfy Max cushion shoe. It's also a capable long run shoe, and the hype definitely didn't fade with this one. But even though Puma typically excels in durability, there's some early signs of wear in my Puma MagX on the upper and on the outsole that give me a little bit of a cause for concern, especially given the $180 price point for this shoe. (12:35) So, let's take a look at some alternatives that are available. Now, in my first review of the Mag Max, I gave you some Max Cushion alternatives to consider. This time, I'm going to give you some long run alternatives to consider. And when it comes to long run shoes, one of the first shoes that I think about is from AS6, and that is the Super Blast. (12:55) This is the Superb Blast version two. Now, these two shoes are similar in terms of stack height, and I think they are trying to achieve the same things, but AS6 approaches it a little bit differently, using a race caliber foam for the bulk of the shoe, and then just a little bit of daily training foam on the bottom to keep things a little bit more stable and tuned for some slower paces than racing foams would normally indicate. (13:20) And I think that overall, while they both fit really well and they both very comfortable both for easy running and for faster long run type of work, I prefer the Superb Blast 2 as a long run shoe because it's just got a little bit more pep. Plus, it's holding up at the 100 mile mark a little bit better than the Puma Mag. That shoe though comes in at a $200 price point, which is a lot more than the already expensive 180 from the Puma MagX. (13:46) I've been saying for a long time that the original 225 price point of the Super Blast and then the $200 price point that I got reduced to for the later part of Super Blast and into Super Blast 2 is way too expensive. But then again, you guys keep buying them and it keeps selling out. So, I'm guessing that's the right price. (14:05) The other shoe that I want to talk about is the other shoe of the two shoes that I think of most clearly when I think about long run shoes, and that's from the swoosh. This is the Nike Invincible 3. This uses only Zumax foam, which is their race caliber foam. Although, I suspect that it's tweaked quite a bit to give it more of the kind of experience that they're looking for in this shoe, which it can do some max cushion type of work depending on your foot strike. (14:31) But for me, I really like it and I think it sings when you get up to some faster paces from slightly faster than easy all the way up to marathon pace. This shoe is really fun. Plus, it's got some durability into it, so you can put in a lot of miles. Again, I feel like compared to like pure long run shoes, the Mag Max suffers a little bit in terms of it's a little bit clunky and not quite as peppy, but I do think the Magax can do max cushion stuff a bit better. (14:59) Again, depending on what you're looking for, that's going to help you decide between the Invincible and the Magax. The Invincible comes in at the same $180 price point, and I feel like that's still kind of high. Uh, but the good news is the Invincible 3 has been out for a really long time. So, depending on how comfortable you are with the wrist and doing some online shopping, you might be able to find the Invincible 3 in your size at a significant discount. (15:27) So, those are my thoughts on the Puma MagX. After 100 miles, this shoe is legit, and I'm really looking forward to what happens in version two. Hopefully, you'll be able to correct some of those little wear and tear issues and give us an even better shoe next time. If you have any other questions about this shoe or any other shoes that I've talked about today, feel free to put them in the comments down below or better yet, stop by the live stream that I do Mondays and Thursdays over on the Kofuzi Run Club channel. I'd love to see you guys over (15:51) there in the chat. That's all for today, everybody. Thanks so much for making it all the way to the end of this video. Hopefully you guys are staying safe out there on your runs, and I'll see you in the next one. Yo, what's going on? [Music]"

(do not remember this in memory) hey, I'm in India. My bathroom uses some kind of Schell flush system, but I'm not fully aware of the internal system, and even the plumbers cannot properly understand it. It looks something like the one in this photo. 

I hate the face plate. I have it in all the bathrooms in my house. It makes an ugly, squeaky sound every time I press it. I want to replace just the face plate with that of a different company, but I'm wondering if that is even possible. Can you help me find a solution?

Replacing just the faceplate of a flush system like the Schell one you’ve described can be tricky but not impossible. Here's an outline of how you can approach this:

### 1. **Check Compatibility with Other Brands**
   - Most concealed flush systems (like Schell’s) are designed to work best with their own faceplates. However, some brands offer universal faceplates or compatible alternatives. Look for brands like Geberit, Toto, or Grohe that might offer cross-compatible models.
   - Contact Schell directly or consult their website/manuals to check if they allow any alternative faceplates or adapters.

### 2. **Investigate Your Existing Flush Mechanism**
   - Open the existing faceplate and inspect the internal mechanism.
   - Measure key dimensions like:
     - The distance between mounting screws
     - Size of the flush button
     - Connection mechanism (e.g., rods or pneumatic controls)
   - Take photos of the internal structure to compare with other brands’ faceplates or consult a plumbing expert.

### 3. **Purchase a Universal Faceplate**
   - Some companies make generic faceplates that can adapt to different concealed cisterns. These might have adjustable components to fit a variety of systems.
   - Verify this with a plumbing store or a reputable online retailer in India.

### 4. **Consult with a Professional**
   - Since the plumbers you’ve consulted so far aren’t familiar with the system, consider contacting Schell’s India customer service or finding a Schell-certified installer for more clarity.

### 5. **Lubricate the Mechanism**
   - If the squeaky sound is your main issue, it might be caused by friction in the internal components or aging materials. Before replacing the faceplate, try applying silicone spray or a non-corrosive lubricant to the moving parts behind the faceplate.

### 6. **Replace the Entire Mechanism**
   - If replacing the faceplate alone isn’t feasible, replacing the entire concealed cistern with a system from a preferred brand (like Geberit or Toto) is an option. This is more involved and would require a contractor, but it gives you full control over design and function.

If you’d like, I can help you search for compatible faceplates or guides specific to Schell systems in India.

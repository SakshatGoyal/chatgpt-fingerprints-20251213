### 🎯 Why it’s a good choice  
- If you swim regularly (especially in chlorinated pools) this jammer’s fabric durability means it will last better than generic swim trunks.  
- The drawcord + modest coverage (jammer style) means better support and less drag vs loose swim shorts — beneficial if you’re doing serious laps.  
- UPF protection is a bonus if you’re doing outdoor swimming or open‐air pools.  
- The price (~₹999) is quite reasonable for a branded performance swim jammer in India.

### 🛍 Buying Tips (in India)  
- **Size**: Jammers fit differently than board shorts – they’re snug. If you already use a size 32 in regular pants, you might try 32 in this; but check Speedo’s size chart for swimwear.  
- **Colour/Stock**: Some colours may be limited in India. The “True Navy” version is listed in extra sizes. citeturn0search1  
- **Care**: Follow the fabric instructions: machine wash at ~30°C, no tumble-dry, no bleach, no ironing. That helps maintain the chlorine-resistance. citeturn0search0  
- **Price checking**: While Speedo India lists ₹999, other retailers (sales/coupons) may have it lower—worth checking for deals.  
- **Purpose**: If you swim casually once in a while, this is a good pick; if you’re doing competitive racing you might want a more “racing” cut, but for general lap swimming this is ample.

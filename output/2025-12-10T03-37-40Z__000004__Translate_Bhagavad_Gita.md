The excerpt you shared contains far more than a single printed page—it runs through the bulk of the Bhagavad Gītā.  Rendering every verse line-for-line into English would overflow the limits of one chat response (and likely several).  

Could you narrow it down?  
* For example: a particular chapter, or a block of verses (e.g., 2.47–2.55).*  

Let me know the exact range you want translated and I’ll deliver it verbatim, no commentary.

Here is the **complete English translation of Chapter 1** of the *Bhagavad Gītā*, line by line, based solely on the content from the uploaded source:

---

**1.** Dhṛtarāṣṭra said:  
In the field of Dharma, at Kurukṣetra, assembled and desiring to fight, what did my sons and the sons of Pāṇḍu do, O Sañjaya?

**2.** Sañjaya said:  
Seeing the army of the sons of Pāṇḍu arrayed in battle formation, King Duryodhana then approached his teacher and spoke the following words:

**3.** Behold, O Teacher, this mighty army of the sons of Pāṇḍu, arrayed by the son of Drupada, your wise disciple.

**4.** Here are heroic bowmen equal in battle to Bhīma and Arjuna—Yuyudhāna, Virāṭa, and Drupada the great chariot-warrior.

**5.** Dhṛṣṭaketu, Cekitāna, and the valiant king of Kāśī,  
Purujiṭ, Kuntibhoja, and Śaibya, the best of men;

**6.** The mighty Yudhāmanyu, the valiant Uttamaujas,  
The son of Subhadrā, and the sons of Draupadī—all great chariot-warriors.

**7.** But know, O best of the twice-born, those who are especially distinguished on our side—these I name to you for your information, the leaders of my army.

**8.** You yourself, Bhīṣma, Karṇa, and Kṛpa, the victorious in battle;  
Aśvatthāmā, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta as well.

**9.** And many other heroes, all skilled in various weapons and armed for battle, who have risked their lives for me—all proficient in war.

**10.** This army of ours, commanded by Bhīṣma, is not sufficient;  
Whereas their army, commanded by Bhīma, is sufficient.

**11.** Therefore, stationed in your respective positions in the ranks, all of you support Bhīṣma alone on all sides.

**12.** Then the grand old man of the Kuru dynasty, Bhīṣma, the glorious elder, blew his conch loudly, sounding like a lion’s roar, giving Duryodhana joy.

**13.** Then conches, kettledrums, tabors, drums, and cow-horns were suddenly sounded, and the noise became tumultuous.

**14.** Then Mādhava and the son of Pāṇḍu, standing in their grand chariot yoked with white horses, also blew their divine conches.

**15.** Hṛṣīkeśa blew Pāñcajanya; Dhanañjaya blew Devadatta;  
Bhīma, doer of terrible deeds, blew the great conch Pauṇḍra.

**16.** King Yudhishṭhira, son of Kuntī, blew Anantavijaya;  
Nakula and Sahadeva blew Sughoṣa and Maṇipuṣpaka.

**17.** The king of Kāśī, an excellent archer, Śikhaṇḍin the great chariot-warrior, Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Virāṭa, and Sātyaki the unconquerable;

**18.** Drupada and the sons of Draupadī, O Lord of Earth, and the mighty-armed son of Subhadrā—all together blew their respective conches.

**19.** The tumultuous sound rent the hearts of the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, filling the sky and the earth with noise.

**20.** Then, O King, seeing the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra standing arrayed and the discharge of weapons about to begin, Arjuna, with a flag bearing Hanuman, took up his bow.

**21.** Arjuna then said to Hṛṣīkeśa:  
Place my chariot, O Acyuta, between the two armies,

**22.** So that I may see those who are present, eager to fight,  
With whom I must engage in this battle.

**23.** I wish to observe those who have assembled here to fight, desiring to please the evil-minded son of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.

**24.** Sañjaya said:  
Thus addressed by Arjuna, Hṛṣīkeśa placed the excellent chariot between the two armies.

**25.** In front of Bhīṣma and Droṇa and all the rulers of the earth, he said: “Behold, O Pārtha, all the Kurus assembled here.”

**26.** There Arjuna saw, stationed in both armies, fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, friends,

**27.** Fathers-in-law and benefactors;  
Seeing all his kinsmen arrayed,

**28.** Arjuna, filled with deep compassion and despair, spoke this sorrowfully:

**29.** “Seeing these kinsmen of mine gathered here with the intention of fighting, O Kṛṣṇa, my limbs fail, and my mouth becomes dry;

**30.** My body trembles, my hair stands on end,  
My bow slips from my hand, and my skin burns all over.

**31.** I am unable to remain standing; my mind is reeling;  
And I see omens of misfortune, O Keśava.

**32.** Nor do I see any good in killing my own kinsmen in battle.

**33.** O Kṛṣṇa, I desire neither victory, nor kingdom, nor pleasures.  
What is kingdom to us, O Govinda? What are enjoyments or even life?

**34.** Those for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures,  
They are here arrayed in battle, ready to give up their lives and wealth—

**35.** Teachers, fathers, sons, and also grandfathers,  
Maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other relatives.

**36.** Even though they might kill me, O Slayer of Madhu,  
I do not wish to kill them—not even for the sovereignty of the three worlds, let alone for the earth.

**37.** What joy will be ours, O Jānārdana, from killing the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra?

**38.** Sin alone will take hold of us if we kill these aggressors.

**39.** Therefore we should not kill the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, our relatives;  
Indeed, how can we be happy after killing our own people, O Mādhava?

**40.** Even if their hearts, overcome by greed, do not see the wrong in destroying families and betrayal of friends,

**41.** Why should we, who see the evil of such destruction, not refrain from this sinful act?

**42.** On the destruction of the family, the eternal family traditions perish;  
And when traditions are destroyed, lawlessness prevails in the family.

**43.** When lawlessness prevails, O Kṛṣṇa, the women of the family become corrupt;  
And when women are corrupted, a mixture of castes arises.

**44.** This mixture leads the family and the destroyers of the family to hell;  
Their ancestors fall, deprived of offerings of rice and water.

**45.** By these evil deeds of destroyers of families,  
Which cause a confusion of castes, the eternal duties of the caste and the family are destroyed.

**46.** We have heard, O Janārdana, that those men who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell.

**47.** Alas, we are engaged in a great sin, prepared to kill our own relatives out of greed for the pleasures of kingship.

**48.** If the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, weapons in hand, were to kill me unarmed and unresisting in battle, that would be better for me.

**49.** Sañjaya said:  
Having spoken thus on the battlefield, Arjuna sat down in his chariot,  
Casting aside his bow and arrows, his mind overwhelmed with sorrow.

Here is the **complete English translation of Chapter 2** of the *Bhagavad Gītā*, line by line, based strictly on the uploaded Sanskrit source:

---

**1.** Sañjaya said:  
To him who was thus overcome by pity, whose eyes were filled with tears and distressed, Madhusūdana spoke these words:

**2.** The Blessed Lord said:  
Whence has this dejection come upon you in this crisis? It is unworthy of an Ārya, not leading to heaven, and brings infamy, O Arjuna.

**3.** Yield not to unmanliness, O Pārtha! It does not befit you.  
Cast off this petty weakness of heart. Stand up, O scorcher of enemies!

**4.** Arjuna said:  
O Madhusūdana, how shall I fight with arrows in battle against Bhīṣma and Droṇa, who are worthy of worship, O destroyer of enemies?

**5.** It is better to live in this world by begging than to slay these noble teachers.  
Even if they are greedy for wealth, they are my teachers. By killing them, I would only enjoy bloodstained pleasures.

**6.** Nor do we know which is better for us: whether we shall conquer them or they shall conquer us.  
Those, after killing whom we do not wish to live, are arrayed before us—the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.

**7.** My nature is overpowered by weakness; my mind is confused about duty.  
I ask You—tell me what is definitely good for me. I am Your disciple. Instruct me, who has taken refuge in You.

**8.** I do not see what will remove this sorrow that is drying up my senses,  
Even if I were to obtain a prosperous and unrivalled kingdom on earth or lordship of the gods.

**9.** Sañjaya said:  
Having spoken thus to Hṛṣīkeśa, Arjuna said “I will not fight,” and became silent.

**10.** O Bharata, then Hṛṣīkeśa, smiling in the midst of both armies, spoke the following words to the despondent Arjuna.

**11.** The Blessed Lord said:  
You grieve for those who should not be grieved for, yet speak words of wisdom.  
The wise grieve neither for the living nor the dead.

**12.** Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor these kings; nor in the future shall we cease to be.

**13.** Just as in this body the embodied soul passes through childhood, youth, and old age,  
So also it passes into another body—the steadfast are not deluded by this.

**14.** O son of Kuntī, contact with matter brings cold and heat, pleasure and pain—they come and go, and are impermanent. Endure them, O Bhārata.

**15.** That person whom these do not afflict, O best of men, who is balanced in pain and pleasure, is fit for immortality.

**16.** The unreal has no existence; the real never ceases to be.  
Those who see the truth have concluded this about both.

**17.** Know that to be indestructible by which all this is pervaded.  
None can cause the destruction of that imperishable.

**18.** These bodies of the eternal, indestructible, and immeasurable soul are said to have an end.  
Fight, therefore, O Bhārata.

**19.** He who thinks that the soul kills, and he who thinks it is killed, are both ignorant.  
It kills not, nor is it killed.

**20.** It is never born, nor does it ever die; nor, having once been, does it ever cease to be.  
It is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, and ancient; it is not slain when the body is slain.

**21.** How can one who knows this soul to be indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable,  
Slay anyone or cause anyone to be slain?

**22.** Just as a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones,  
So the soul accepts new bodies, giving up the old ones.

**23.** Weapons do not cut it, fire does not burn it,  
Water does not wet it, wind does not dry it.

**24.** It cannot be cut, burned, wetted, or dried.  
It is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable, and everlasting.

**25.** It is said to be unmanifest, unthinkable, and unchangeable.  
Therefore, knowing this, you should not grieve.

**26.** Even if you think the soul is constantly born and constantly dies,  
Still, O mighty-armed, you should not grieve.

**27.** For death is certain for the born, and birth is certain for the dead.  
Therefore, you should not grieve over what is unavoidable.

**28.** Beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their middle state, and unmanifest again in their end.  
Why then lament?

**29.** One sees this as a wonder, another speaks of it as a wonder,  
Another hears of it as a wonder, and yet another, even hearing, does not understand it.

**30.** The soul dwelling in all bodies is eternal and indestructible.  
Therefore, O Bhārata, you should not mourn for any creature.

**31.** Moreover, considering your own duty as a warrior, you should not waver,  
For there is nothing more worthy for a warrior than a righteous war.

**32.** Fortunate are the warriors to whom such an opportunity comes,  
An open door to heaven, O Pārtha.

**33.** But if you do not perform your righteous duty in battle,  
Then you will incur sin, having abandoned your duty and honor.

**34.** People will speak of your infamy forever,  
And for a man of honor, dishonor is worse than death.

**35.** The great warriors will think that you withdrew from battle out of fear,  
And you will be despised by those who held you in esteem.

**36.** Your enemies will speak many unseemly words,  
Ridiculing your ability. What could be more painful?

**37.** If you are killed, you will attain heaven; if you are victorious, you will enjoy the earth.  
Therefore, rise, O son of Kuntī, resolved to fight.

**38.** Treating alike pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat,  
Prepare yourself for battle. Thus you will not incur sin.

**39.** This wisdom has been declared to you from the standpoint of Sāṅkhya;  
Now hear it from the standpoint of Yoga, armed with which, O Pārtha, you will break the bonds of karma.

**40.** In this path, there is no loss of effort, nor is there any harm.  
Even a little of this dharma protects one from great fear.

**41.** In this, the resolute understanding is one-pointed,  
But the thoughts of the irresolute are many-branched and endless.

**42.** Those who lack discernment, delighting in the flowery words of the Vedas,  
Say, “There is nothing else,” being attached to pleasure and power.

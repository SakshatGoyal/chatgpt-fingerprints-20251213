Hey Michael, thanks a lot for all this work that you have done so what I am going to do or what I need from you is I need you to really think through all the tasks needed for this literature study right? I think you've made a very good list of recommendations like I like your recommended industries and vertical segments for a research p so the issue with our team is like the data collectors like the people going in looking for information they're relatively low skilled employees so what they need is almost like a very Naro step-by-step instructions on what to search what to look for and what to type so there's going to be a lot of handholding involved because they sort of they don't often like think through things so what they need is someone to just like hold their hands as they move along so while you've given me a very good approach to thinking about this research I need to I can't communicate this as is to my team so could you go through the last few interactions we've had amongst each other and sort of listed out all the keywords on the conditions of search and give me a very clear crisp set of step-by-step instructions that I could share with my team so it'll almost turn into sort of like a checklist one thing to keep in mind is they may not independently do all the research combinations that you're suggesting, for example, in the step three that you outline which is expanded strategy for excel effective data collection, you've listed out sources in the form of academic journals, industry reports case studies so for each source I want you to give me like certain keywords that I should search for in those sources. I see that you have a recommendation on journals publishers like Howard business review how business school case studies books memoirs website from McKenzie BCG Deloitte all those things so list that is like for each of the sources what are some keywords that I should look for and the advanced search strategy you've given example search queri and I think these are given as suggestions but I won't be able to give just suggestions I need to basically create a long checklist for my team. I think these operators like the bullying operators that you have shared with me are ideal for like searching in Google scholar so even for Google scholar I want you to create like a whole checklist of like keywords to search for along with or actually just give me the exact queries like create a checklist for all the queries

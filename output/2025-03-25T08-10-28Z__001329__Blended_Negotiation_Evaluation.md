### CATEGORICAL MODULE 37 - C2-I1

Blended Negotiation Approaches as a Response to Digital Limitations
Insight Statement:
Although e-negotiation enhances supply chain agility, its inherent limitations—such as the absence of non-verbal cues—suggest that a blended approach combining digital and in-person interactions may better serve strategic needs. [Inferred]

Executive Decision-Making Context:

Strategic Dilemma: Executives must reconcile the efficiency of digital negotiations with the nuanced communication that face-to-face interactions offer.

Underlying Beliefs & Biases: There is a bias towards full digitalization, sometimes overlooking the value of personal interaction in complex negotiations.

Expected vs. Actual Outcomes: While digital tools streamline processes, the lack of physical cues can impede relationship building and trust.

Broader Implications: A hybrid model, where digital negotiations are complemented by selective in-person engagements, could optimize both efficiency and relational depth. [Inferred]

Supporting Context:
The study shows that e-negotiation positively affects agility (β = 0.409, p < 0.001) yet notes challenges inherent to digital-only interactions, prompting the need for a blended negotiation framework. [Empirical]

🔹 COUNTERFACTUAL SCENARIO:

A global software development firm functioning entirely remotely finds that attempts at blended negotiations introduce unnecessary complexity, slowing decision cycles due to scheduling conflicts and geographical dispersion, ultimately reducing agility.

🔹 ASSUMPTIONS & BIASES:

Overconfidence in hybrid models: Assumes blended negotiation inherently combines the best of digital and in-person interactions without accounting for complexity and inefficiencies introduced by dual modes.

Implicit belief in face-to-face superiority: Presupposes that physical presence always adds meaningful context or clarity.

Status quo bias: Suggests retention of in-person methods despite proven effectiveness of purely digital negotiation in certain settings.

🔹 CONTEXT LIMITATIONS:

This insight may fail in globalized digital-first industries (technology, software development, consulting) where physical meetings are costly, impractical, or unnecessary. It also breaks down in contexts of established trust, where non-verbal cues are less critical due to strong existing relationships or shared digital work cultures.

🔹 FINAL CRITIQUE:

There is tension between advocating a blended model for strategic nuance and the inherent complexity that mixed-mode negotiations introduce, potentially undermining the agility that digital negotiation originally sought to achieve. The model also implicitly idealizes face-to-face interactions without fully scrutinizing scenarios where purely digital negotiations are equally or more effective.

The module clearly identifies the dilemma between digital efficiency and the loss of non-verbal communication, while also highlighting the trade-off between agility and relational depth.

– **Challenging Assumptions & Reframing (Scores 4/5):**
It questions the prevailing bias toward full digitalization and suggests a hybrid model as a nuanced reframe, though some aspects (e.g., idealizing in‐person cues) could be pushed further.

– **Use of Reasoning & Interaction Potential (Scores 4/5):**
The reasoning is well integrated with empirical support (β = 0.409, p < 0.001), and the counterfactual scenario provokes dialogue regarding potential pitfalls of a blended approach.

– **Bias & Context Clarity (Scores 5/5):**
The module is strong on surfacing biases (overconfidence in hybrid models, implicit face-to-face superiority) and clearly articulates its context limitations.

– **Over-Generality Penalty (Score 3, yielding –6 points):**
While the insight is generally focused, some phrasing remains somewhat broad regarding the inherent superiority of physical presence, which reduces the overall score slightly.

– **Other Dimensions:**
The evaluation awards high marks for avoiding reliance on internal data, minimizing cross-level noise, and offering a sharp final critique—even as it acknowledges that the blended approach may not add value in all settings.

This evaluation yields a total weighted score of 152 for Categorical Module 37 – C2-I1, indicating a strong, strategically rich module with room to further refine its specificity in challenging assumptions.

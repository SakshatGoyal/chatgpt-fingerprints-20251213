I wanna make a simple stirfry of cauliflower, carrots, green beans. But I wanna do it in an airfryer. 

I've never been able to get it right. How should I do it?

Using an air fryer for a stir-fry-style dish can work well if you manage the timing and seasoning properly. Here's how to achieve it:

### Ingredients:
- **Cauliflower florets** – 1 cup
- **Carrots** – 1 cup, thinly sliced or julienned
- **Green beans** – 1 cup, trimmed
- **Oil** – 1-2 tsp (olive oil, sesame oil, or avocado oil work well)
- **Soy sauce** – 1 tbsp
- **Garlic powder** – 1 tsp
- **Ginger powder** – 1/2 tsp (optional)
- **Chili flakes** or **pepper** – to taste
- **Sesame seeds** – for garnish (optional)

---

### Steps:

1. **Prep the Vegetables**: 
   - Cut cauliflower into small florets.
   - Slice carrots thinly to ensure even cooking.
   - Trim green beans and cut them into bite-sized pieces.

2. **Season the Veggies**:
   - In a large bowl, toss the vegetables with oil, soy sauce, garlic powder, ginger powder, and chili flakes. Mix well to coat evenly.

3. **Preheat the Air Fryer**:
   - Set the air fryer to **375°F (190°C)** and preheat for about 3-5 minutes.

4. **Cook in Batches (if needed)**:
   - Spread the vegetables in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Overcrowding can lead to uneven cooking.
   - Air fry at **375°F (190°C)** for **10-12 minutes**, shaking the basket halfway through to ensure even cooking.

5. **Check for Doneness**:
   - After 10 minutes, check if the vegetables are tender and slightly charred. If not, cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.

6. **Serve**:
   - Garnish with sesame seeds or a drizzle of sesame oil if desired. Serve hot as a side dish or over rice/noodles.

### Tips:
- **Consistency**: Cut the vegetables uniformly so they cook evenly.
- **Don’t skip shaking**: Shaking the basket halfway through is crucial to mimic stir-frying in a pan.
- **Crispness**: If you like your veggies crispy, cook for an extra 2-3 minutes, but watch closely to avoid burning.
- **Sauce**: If you want a saucier finish, toss the cooked veggies with extra soy sauce or a stir-fry sauce after cooking.

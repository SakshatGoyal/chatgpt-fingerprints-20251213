Absolutely. Here's a rewritten version of your table that keeps the core insight but uses more human-centered, plain language — so it feels clearer, less technical, and easier to relate to. I’ve preserved the structure and made sure each row still offers practical, industry-specific guidance:

---

| **Industry** | **What Stakeholders Expect** | **Main Challenge** | **What’s Driving the Tension** | **What Makes It Complicated** | **How Leaders Are Adapting** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pharmaceuticals** | - Keep investor confidence high
- Hit regulatory milestones
- Maintain strong market value | - Staying optimistic without overpromising
- Being honest about risks without losing credibility | - Pressure to keep valuation up
- Need to stay transparent with regulators

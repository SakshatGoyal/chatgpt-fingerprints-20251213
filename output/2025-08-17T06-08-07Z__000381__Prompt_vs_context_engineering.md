# Prompt vs context engineering

## You (2025-08-17T06:08:07.689000+00:00)

I'm going to share a couple of exchanges between ChatGPT and me. For now, just internalize these, then I'll ask you some questions.

---
Me:
So, I need you to put on your professional hat as an AI researcher and scientist who's special skillset involves designing custom GPTs.

How much of making a custom GPT is about prompt engineering vs context engineering?

ChatGPT:
Excellent framing — let me answer with my **AI researcher / custom GPT designer hat on.**

### ⚖️ Prompt Engineering vs Context Engineering in Custom GPT Design

When building a **custom GPT**, you’re not just writing a single prompt — you’re designing a **whole operating environment** for the model. That environment is where **context engineering dominates**. Here’s how the balance usually plays out:

---

#### 1. **Prompt Engineering (≈ 20–30%)**

This is the **entry point design**:

* Crafting system instructions (the “persona” / role).
* Designing example interactions (few-shot examples).
* Phrasing queries clearly and in the right style.

It matters because bad prompts → confused outputs. But once a solid base is set, the marginal returns on further prompt tweaking diminish.

Think of prompt engineering here as **choosing the front door and signage** for the GPT.

---

#### 2. **Context Engineering (≈ 70–80%)**

This is the **real backbone** of custom GPTs. It includes:

* **Knowledge injection** → Supplying reference docs, curated datasets, or retrieval-augmented memory.
* **Scaffolding** → Designing workflows, structured inputs/outputs, reasoning steps.
* **Guardrails** → Clear constraints (what to ignore, what to emphasize, failure modes to avoid).
* **Continuity mechanisms** → Memory or context threading across sessions.
* **Persona depth** → Framing with layered roles (e.g., “act as a scientist, but also highlight policy implications as a regulator would”).

In practice, the **context setup determines 80–90% of reliability**. You can give the same prompt to two GPTs with different context ecosystems, and one will perform like a polished professional while the other feels generic.

Think of context engineering as **designing the building, tools, and reference library that sit behind the front door.**

---

### 🔬 Why Context Engineering Dominates in Custom GPTs

* **Durability**: A prompt is one-shot, but context scaffolding applies across all user interactions.
* **Precision**: Fine-grained retrieval, constraints, and weighting stop drift and hallucinations.
* **Adaptability**: You can swap or update context layers (e.g., new documents, new memory rules) without rewriting the “prompt persona.”
* **Scalability**: Context frameworks let your GPT handle varied inputs consistently, not just the narrow cases your prompt anticipated.

---

### 🧪 Researcher’s Analogy

If you think of **custom GPT design as building a lab experiment**:

* Prompt engineering = writing the experimental instructions.
* Context engineering = setting up the lab environment (equipment, controlled variables, data, constraints).

Without the environment, even the clearest instructions won’t yield reproducible results.

---

✅ **Bottom line:**

* In custom GPTs, **prompt engineering is the seed**;
* **Context engineering is the soil, water, and ecosystem** that determines whether it grows into a robust, reliable model.

---

Would you like me to sketch out a **framework for evaluating your own custom GPTs** — like a scoring system for how much weight you’ve put into prompt vs context design? That might give you a practical tool to assess balance.

Me:
Actually, I want to create an outline for research. My goal is to understand frameworks and any additional research professionals have done on the topic of context engineering. You were able to set up a good outline of the main levers: Contextual framing, context injection, context structuring, context weighting, contextual boundaries... But I'm sure most professional researchers may or may not have necessarily classified their research in these terms. If they have, that's great. But if not, then I'm sure it's something new, and if it has enough citations, then it's probably a novel idea or approach to context engineering that we don't know about. Could you think through how we could structure our research?

My goal is to create a research plan that centers around analyzing both research papers, as well as reputable sources like Databricks, OpenAI, Anthropic, IBM, and maybe others. In addition, it wouldn't be bad to also look at some practical applications from startups.

Start by thinking through all the context you might need to understand more about my goals and objectives clearly, and ask me additional questions. I am looking to develop a comprehensive outline for a research project focused on understanding the various frameworks and research findings related to context engineering. In our previous discussions, you provided a solid foundation by outlining the main levers associated with this field, including contextual framing, context injection, context structuring, context weighting, and contextual boundaries. However, I recognize that many professional researchers may not categorize their work using these specific terminologies. If such classifications do exist within the literature, that would be highly beneficial. Conversely, if they do not, this could indicate a novel approach to context engineering that warrants attention, particularly if it has garnered significant citations or recognition in the field.

The objective of my research is twofold: first, to conduct a thorough analysis of academic research papers on context engineering, and second, to explore reputable sources and industry insights from organizations such as Databricks, OpenAI, Anthropic, IBM, and potentially others. This will allow for a well-rounded understanding of both theoretical and practical applications. Moreover, I plan to investigate how startups are putting context engineering principles into practice, as they often drive innovation in emerging areas.

To refine my research plan further, I would appreciate your assistance in identifying all the relevant contexts necessary for enhancing my understanding of my goals and objectives. I am particularly interested in any specific areas of focus, research methodologies, or key questions that should guide my exploration in this field. Please feel free to ask any additional questions that might help clarify my intentions and strengthen the overall research framework.

ChatGPT:
Perfect — I see what you’re aiming for. You’re not just looking to *define* context engineering, but to treat it as a serious research area: gathering, classifying, and evaluating both academic and industry frameworks. That means we need to be careful about **scope, depth, and methodology** before we sketch the outline.

To make sure I really understand your intentions and to help sharpen your research framework, let me probe a bit with targeted questions:

---

### 🔍 Clarifying Questions About Your Research Goals

1. **Theoretical vs. Practical Balance**

   * Do you want your research to lean more toward **academic theory** (e.g., grounding context engineering in cognitive science, HCI, or NLP literature), or **applied frameworks** (e.g., how Databricks, Anthropic, startups implement it in practice)?
   * Or do you want a **hybrid approach**, where you explicitly contrast academic and industry framings?

2. **Disciplinary Scope**

   * Should this research sit *primarily within AI/ML literature*, or should it also scan **adjacent fields** where “context” has been rigorously studied — like information retrieval, distributed systems, communication theory, or cognitive science?
   * Example: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) comes from IR traditions, not just LLM prompt work.

3. **Temporal Scope**

   * Are you focusing **exclusively on LLM-era research (2020–present)**, or do you want to look at **historical antecedents** (e.g., context windows in classical NLP, conversational AI, HCI frameworks)?

4. **Evaluation Angle**

   * Do you want to build a **taxonomy/framework** of context engineering (similar to how you already listed framing/injection/structuring/weighting/boundaries)?
   * Or do you want to run a **meta-analysis** of what’s been studied, which methods are cited, and where the gaps are?

5. **Methodology**

   * Do you see this project as primarily:

     * **Literature review + synthesis** (classifying and evaluating existing frameworks),
     * **Comparative case study** (e.g., contrast how OpenAI, Anthropic, Databricks each articulate context design),
     * **Exploratory grounded theory** (extracting new categories like the ones you proposed from raw literature), or
     * Some combination?

6. **Output Format**

   * What kind of artifact do you want to produce?

     * Academic-style **literature review / survey paper**?
     * A **practitioner’s framework or guide** (applied angle)?
     * A **white paper / briefing** aimed at both researchers and practitioners?

7. **Application Layer**

   * You mentioned startups. Do you want to actually **map case studies** of how startups are using context engineering (e.g., LangChain, Pinecone, LlamaIndex, etc.), or just note them as supplementary evidence of trends?

8. **Novelty Aspiration**

   * Do you want to **coin and formalize “context engineering” as a structured term** (with your levers as a framework), or treat it descriptively (i.e., surveying what others call it, even if terminology varies)?
   * This determines whether your work is **synthesis** (mapping others’ work) or **conceptual innovation** (proposing your own classification and situating it against prior work).

---

### Why These Questions Matter

The answers will shape:

* **Scope of sources** (AI-only vs interdisciplinary).
* **Depth of analysis** (taxonomy vs applied examples vs meta-analysis).
* **Methodology** (systematic literature review vs thematic synthesis).
* **Contribution** (survey vs framework proposal).

---

👉 My suggestion: let’s refine your intent around those questions first, then I can draft a **research plan outline** with:

1. Research objectives,
2. Methodology & sources,
3. Thematic clusters (how to search/classify findings), and
4. Proposed structure of the final output.

---

Would you like me to walk you through a **decision tree** of these questions so you can pick your preferred direction? That way, we’ll converge on a research framework that’s both rigorous *and* aligned with your goals.
---
Me:
**Theoretical vs. Practical Balance:**
I have a strong desire to learn about various concepts, but I also recognize that effective learning goes hand in hand with understanding practical applications in real-world scenarios. Therefore, I propose we adopt a hybrid approach that combines theoretical frameworks with hands-on practice. This will not only enhance our comprehension but also equip us with the necessary skills to apply our knowledge effectively.

**Disciplinary Scope:**
This topic is particularly intriguing. I believe it’s essential to broaden our focus beyond just the traditional AI and machine learning (ML) literature. By scanning adjacent fields—such as behavioral science, cognitive psychology, or data ethics—we can gain a more comprehensive view of the broader landscape. This interdisciplinary perspective can lead to innovative insights and applications.

**Temporal Scope:**
For our research, we should specifically concentrate on the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have significantly changed the landscape of AI research and applications in recent years. Focusing on this timeframe will allow us to analyze contemporary studies that are both rigorous and well-cited. The expectation is that these researchers must have referenced prior literature to substantiate their findings, thus creating a clear linkage between past and present research.

**Evaluation Angle:**
Determining the evaluation angle is quite complex. Our research should strike a balance, encompassing both basic research, which aims to expand general knowledge and understanding, and applied research, which focuses on addressing and solving practical, real-world challenges. However, our final synthesis should include a causal analysis that allows us to identify and understand the underlying reasons for successful outcomes without relying on conjecture. While I prefer to avoid the term 'meta-synthesis'—because it can overlook critical nuances—I do want to engage in some form of inductive thematic analysis. This will enable us to let patterns emerge organically while simultaneously implementing a degree of deductive framework creation. This structured approach will help us organize and present our insights in a valuable manner. I anticipate that this process may involve multiple phases to ensure thorough exploration and understanding.

**Methodology:**
I have previously touched upon aspects of methodology when discussing our evaluation angle. To further refine our approach, we will incorporate integrative and lateral synthesis. This will allow us to explore unconventional connections and ideas from various domains, broadening our exploration beyond just AI/ML research. By linking insights from different disciplines, we can foster creativity and innovation in our findings.

**Output Format:**
At present, we do not have a specific output format established; however, our primary goal is to thoroughly understand the current landscape so that we can formulate our own informed opinions. Additionally, we aim to create a practical guide that will assist us in applying some of these principles in real-world situations without oversimplifying the insights we gather. I am concerned that condensing a wealth of information into a single narrative may dilute its value, resulting in generalities that lack practical applicability. Consequently, we must design our research to address multiple different scenarios and contexts, which may involve exploring unique and novel use cases for generative AI technologies.

**Application Layer:**
I am particularly interested in mapping case studies that demonstrate how startups are leveraging the concept of context engineering. This involves understanding how these organizations effectively integrate and optimize contextual information within their products and services to create meaningful and personalized user experiences.

**Novelty Aspiration:**
Should our approach be descriptive in nature, surveying how various stakeholders characterize context engineering? I believe it is important to acknowledge that terminology can vary significantly across different fields, and embracing this diversity can enhance our understanding and application of the concept. Thus, identifying and analyzing these differing perspectives will be beneficial in creating a comprehensive overview.

Based on the information I have provided in this as well as the previous response, outline a comprehensive multi-phase research and synthesis plan. This should encompass the following stages:

1. **Approach to Gathering Data**: Define the research questions and objectives. Identify the methods for data collection, including qualitative and quantitative approaches. Specify the target population and sampling methods.

2. **Data Collection**: Describe the tools and techniques that will be used to gather data, such as surveys, interviews, focus groups, or observational studies. Provide a timeline for the data collection phase and any ethical considerations.

3. **Sense-Making and Synthesis**: Explain the process for analyzing the collected data. This may involve coding qualitative data, statistical analysis for quantitative data, or comparative analysis. Discuss how insights will be drawn from the data and how they will be synthesized into meaningful findings.

4. **Final Output**: Specify the format of the final deliverable, whether it be a report, presentation, or another format. Outline the key components that will be included, such as an executive summary, recommendations, and potentially actionable insights based on the research findings.

ChatGPT:
Below is a director-level, **multi‑phase research and synthesis plan** for “context engineering” in the LLM era. It blends rigorous academic review with pragmatic industry/application study, and it honors your preferences: **hybrid theoretical–practical**, **interdisciplinary**, **LLM‑era focus (≈2020–present)**, **inductive thematic analysis with deductive framework creation**, and **startup case studies**. I’ve organized it into four mandated stages, and within each stage I break work into concrete phases, tasks, and deliverables.

---

## Stage 1 — Approach to Gathering Data

*(Strategy, scope, questions, constructs, sampling frame)*

### 1.1 Purpose & Payoff

* **Purpose:** Build an interdisciplinary, LLM‑era map of “context engineering”—what it is, what adjacent communities call it, how it works, and when/why it works—then translate that into **actionable design patterns** and **evaluation playbooks**.
* **Payoff:** A shared vocabulary, an evidence-backed framework, and field-tested guidance for practitioners (product, research, data, and design).

### 1.2 Core Research Questions (RQs)

**Concept & Language**

* **RQ1:** How is “context” defined and operationalized across AI/ML, IR (information retrieval), HCI, cognitive/behavioral science, and data ethics—particularly since the rise of LLMs?
* **RQ2:** What terminological variants map to “context engineering” (e.g., retrieval‑augmented generation, in‑context learning, system prompting, memory, long‑context optimization, attention steering, tool use, instruction following, guardrails)?

**Mechanisms & Efficacy**

* **RQ3:** Which **context levers** (your seed set: **framing, injection, structuring, weighting, boundaries**) measurably improve performance, faithfulness, safety, and user experience? Under what conditions?
* **RQ4:** How do these levers interact (synergies, trade‑offs), and how sensitive are outcomes to model family, temperature, context length, retrieval quality, or domain?

**Evaluation & Causality**

* **RQ5:** What **metrics, experimental designs, and evaluation harnesses** can causally attribute gains to specific context choices (vs. confounds like model size or dataset leakage)?

**Practice & Adoption**

* **RQ6:** How are **industry labs** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Databricks, IBM, others) and **startups** applying these levers in products? Which patterns generalize by domain (health, legal, code, customer support, productivity, data analysis)?

**Governance & Risk**

* **RQ7:** What are the security, privacy, IP, and safety implications of different context strategies (e.g., prompt injection risks, PII leakage via retrieval, copyright)?
* **RQ8:** What guidelines and guardrails best mitigate these risks without crushing utility?

### 1.3 Initial Conceptual Model (for deductive scaffolding)

We will treat “context engineering” as a **design space** with the following **primary levers**:

1. **Framing** (role, audience, intent),
2. **Injection** (RAG, memory, tool outputs, structured KBs),
3. **Structuring** (schemas, templates, workflows, planners),
4. **Weighting** (ordering, repetition, salience cues, reranking),
5. **Boundaries** (constraints, scopes, policies).

**Secondary levers** to track in coding:

* **Compression & Distillation** (summaries, map‑reduce, graph‑based condensation).
* **Temporal Freshness** (recency/resolution strategies, update cadence).
* **Multimodal Context** (text + tables + images/code).
* **Security & Integrity** (prompt‑injection defenses, content provenance).
* **Persistence** (short‑term/long‑term memory, lifecycle rules).
* **Governance & Auditability** (logging, explainability surfaces, citations).

> This model guides coding **deductively**, while our thematic analysis also permits **inductive** emergence of new categories.

### 1.4 Construct Operationalization

* **Independent variables (context levers):** presence/absence, dosage (e.g., number of retrieved chunks), position (top vs bottom), format (table vs prose), explicit priority statements, compression ratio, recency cutoff.
* **Dependent variables (outcomes):** task success rate, groundedness/faithfulness, factual precision/recall, robustness to adversarial content, user effort/time, satisfaction, token/cost efficiency.
* **Covariates/controls:** model family/version, temperature, max tokens, domain difficulty, retrieval recall/precision, dataset familiarity.

### 1.5 Study Design (mixed methods)

* **Systematic literature review** (peer‑reviewed + arXiv + reputable industry whitepapers).
* **Practitioner studies** (interviews, surveys, artifact teardowns).
* **Experiments** (factorial/A–B tests manipulating context levers).
* **Case studies** (depth profiles of 12–18 startups across verticals).
* **Comparative analyses** (industry labs’ frameworks vs academic).

### 1.6 Target Populations

* **Academia:** authors in AI/ML, IR, HCI, cognition/behavior, data ethics (2020–present).
* **Industry labs:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Databricks, IBM Research, plus 4–6 additional leaders.
* **Startups:** RAG tooling/infrastructure, domain applications (health/legal/support/analysis), agentic frameworks, safety/guardrail vendors.
* **Practitioners:** ML engineers, prompt/AI designers, PMs, data scientists, security/privacy leads.

### 1.7 Sampling Methods

* **Systematic search** (defined strings; curated venues).
* **Backward/forward snowballing** (citations & co‑citations).
* **Stratified purposeful sampling** (by domain and lever).
* **Theoretical sampling** (expand where codes show novelty).
* **Diversity targets** (ensure cross‑domain and cross‑org coverage).

### 1.8 Ethics & Governance (cross‑cutting)

* Respect IP/TOS of sources; obtain consent for interviews; protect NDAs.
* Anonymize practitioner data; store securely; pre‑register experimental protocols when feasible.
* Document risks (prompt injection, PII, copyright) in all case write‑ups.

---

## Stage 2 — Data Collection

*(Tools, procedures, instruments, timeline)*

### Phase 2.1 — Corpus Construction (Literature & Grey Sources)

**Tasks**

* Define inclusion criteria: LLM‑era (2020+), relevance to context mechanisms/evaluation, credible outlets.
* Build a **reference library** (e.g., Zotero + shared tags); use PRISMA‑style tracking.
* Capture **grey literature**: official org blogs, whitepapers, standards drafts.
* Record metadata: domain, lever(s) addressed, evaluation setup, metrics, key claims.

**Tools**

* Reference manager; screening platform (e.g., Rayyan); light web scrapers where permitted.

**Deliverables**

* **Master bibliography** + PRISMA diagram; **evidence table** (by lever × outcome).

### Phase 2.2 — Practitioner Insights (Interviews/Surveys/Focus)

**Sampling**

* **N≈30–40 interviews** across labs, startups, and practitioners; **N≈100–200 survey** respondents from practitioner forums.
* Ensure representation by domain and role (eng, design, PM, safety, data).

**Instruments**

* **Semi‑structured interview guide** covering: context strategies used, failure modes, evaluation practices, decision criteria, trade‑offs, governance.
* **Survey** with Likert items on lever usage, perceived efficacy, and constraints; free‑text for patterns.

**Ethics**

* Consent, option to anonymize org/name, secure storage, IRB‑style checklist if institutional.

**Deliverables**

* Transcripts/notes; initial affinity map of practitioner themes.

### Phase 2.3 — Product & System Teardowns (Observational)

**Targets**

* 12–18 **startup case studies** (balanced across verticals); 6–8 **reference products** from major labs.
  **Procedure**
* Public artifact analysis: docs, demos, API references, changelogs; where possible, sandbox trials.
* Code the presence/strength of each lever; note evaluation claims and governance elements.

**Deliverables**

* **Case‑study dossiers** and a **comparative matrix** (lever coverage × domain × maturity).

### Phase 2.4 — Controlled Experiments (Quantitative)

**Design**

* **Factorial experiments** manipulating 2–4 levers at a time (e.g., structuring × weighting × boundaries), with controls for model/temperature/max tokens.
* Tasks: multi‑hop QA, data‑to‑text, code comprehension, retrieval QA, decision support.
* **A–B tests** for specific interventions (e.g., adding explicit boundaries, adding recency filters).
* **Robustness checks:** adversarial injections, conflicting evidence, noisy retrieval.

**Measures**

* Objective metrics (accuracy, groundedness/faithfulness, answer similarity), human‑in‑the‑loop ratings with calibrated rubrics; token/cost/time.

**Deliverables**

* Clean datasets; experiment logs; analysis notebooks.

### Indicative Timeline (12–16 weeks; overlapping)

* **Weeks 1–3:** Corpus build + protocols + instruments.
* **Weeks 3–8:** Literature screening/coding (rolling); interviews/surveys; teardowns.
* **Weeks 6–12:** Experiments.
* **Weeks 10–16:** Synthesis, writing, playbooks, validation workshops.

---

## Stage 3 — Sense‑Making and Synthesis

*(Analysis plan, causal inference, integration, validation)*

### Phase 3.1 — Coding & Thematic Analysis (Qualitative)

**Process**

* Develop a **codebook** seeded by the lever model; allow **open coding** to surface emergent categories.
* Double‑code 15–20% of items; compute inter‑coder agreement (e.g., Cohen’s κ); reconcile.
* Produce **theme maps**: where fields agree/disagree, gaps, terminological crosswalks.

**Outputs**

* Taxonomy with definitions; **term crosswalk** (what each field/org calls similar ideas); evidence‑backed **design patterns** and **anti‑patterns**.

### Phase 3.2 — Comparative & Bibliometric Analysis

* **Citation and co‑word networks** to locate schools of thought.
* **Cluster comparisons** (academic vs industry; domain vs domain).
* **Heatmaps**: lever usage × outcome claims × evidence strength.

### Phase 3.3 — Quantitative & Causal Analysis

**Approach**

* **Factorial ANOVA / regression** to estimate main and interaction effects of levers.
* **Ablation studies** (remove one lever at a time).
* **Sensitivity analyses** for retrieval quality, temperature, context length.
* **Robustness**: adversarial and out‑of‑distribution stress tests.
* **Attribution**: Shapley‑style or dominance analysis to apportion variance (where appropriate).
* **Pre‑registered hypotheses** for confirmatory segments; exploratory results clearly labeled.

**Outputs**

* Effect sizes per lever; **conditions‑of‑use** tables (when a lever helps/hurts).
* **Causal narratives** tying mechanisms to outcomes with minimal speculation.

### Phase 3.4 — Integrative & Lateral Synthesis (Interdisciplinary)

* Map findings to **cognitive psychology** (schema theory, context‑dependent memory, cognitive load), **behavioral science** (framing effects), **HCI** (interaction scaffolds), **IR** (ranking/reranking), and **data ethics** (consent, provenance, fairness).
* Extract **governance principles** (boundary‑setting, data lineage, audit trails) aligned to context practices.
* Produce a **maturity model** for organizations (from “prompt tinkering” → “context‑first systems”).

### Phase 3.5 — Validation & Critique

* **Expert panel reviews** (academia + industry) on taxonomy and patterns.
* **Red‑team sessions** to probe failure modes (prompt injection, conflicting context).
* **Practitioner workshops** to test the usability of the playbooks and checklists.

---

* **Roles:** Research director (you), method lead, bibliographer, experiment engineer, qualitative lead, ethics/privacy lead, domain SMEs.
* **Traceability:** Every pattern links to sources, evidence strength, and counter‑examples.
* **Translation:** We pair each insight with a **design move** (what to do) and an **evaluation move** (how to test it).

---

## ChatGPT (2025-08-17T06:08:08.351509+00:00)

Got it — I’ve fully internalized the exchanges you shared. I see the progression:

1. You started by distinguishing **prompt engineering vs context engineering** in custom GPTs.
2. Then you pushed toward building a **research plan** to survey both academic and industry work on context engineering — not just descriptive, but aiming for synthesis and potentially novel framing.
3. Finally, you laid out preferences: **hybrid theory + practice, interdisciplinary scope, LLM-era focus, inductive thematic analysis balanced with deductive scaffolding, and case studies of startups**.

The other ChatGPT responded with a **multi-phase research and synthesis plan** — essentially a full IDEO-style research strategy, broken into **data gathering, collection, sense-making, and outputs**, complete with methods, deliverables, and even templates.

I’m holding all of this context.

Would you like me, as your “Michael” persona, to now **critique and refine that plan** (e.g., where it might be too heavy, where it could be sharper, or more aligned with real-world research execution)? Or would you prefer me to **zoom out first** and help you clarify what success looks like for you personally in this research project (e.g., academic credibility, practitioner toolkit, thought leadership)?

## You (2025-08-17T06:11:49.286000+00:00)

I just want to be honest—I’m finding it a bit tricky to wrap my head around all these different phases of the research plan. It looks like there are four phases in total, and I get that phase one is all about figuring out how we’ll collect the data. Then, phase two is where we actually conduct the research. But beyond that, I’m struggling a little to understand the rest of the plan in simpler terms. If you could break it down for me, that would be awesome!

## ChatGPT (2025-08-17T06:11:49.860939+00:00)

That makes total sense — the plan is pretty dense, and it reads more like something you’d hand a research team than something you’d use to orient yourself quickly. Let me **strip it down to the essentials** and explain the four stages in plain language:

---

### **Stage 1 — Framing the Research (the setup)**
Think of this as building the *blueprint*.

- Define your **big questions**: What do we mean by “context engineering”? How do people use it? Does it really make systems better? What risks come with it?
- Decide **where you’ll look**: academic papers, industry labs, startups, practitioners.
- Sketch a **model of the space** (those levers: framing, injection, structuring, weighting, boundaries).
- Make rules for what counts as useful data and how you’ll keep things ethical.

👉 *In short: Set the direction, decide what’s “in scope,” and design the playbook for how to explore.*

---

### **Stage 2 — Gathering the Evidence (the fieldwork)**
This is where you **go out and collect the material**.

- **Literature & reports** → build a library of academic papers, industry whitepapers, and credible blogs.
- **Interviews & surveys** → talk to practitioners (engineers, designers, PMs, safety folks) about how they actually use context.
- **Case studies** → analyze startups and products to see what patterns they follow.
- **Experiments** → run small controlled tests by tweaking context levers and measuring outcomes.

👉 *In short: Collect insights from books, people, products, and experiments.*

---

### **Stage 3 — Making Sense of It All (the analysis)**
Here’s where you **turn raw information into insight**.

- **Code and theme** → Tag all the data using your levers (and let new patterns emerge).
- **Compare & contrast** → See how academia vs industry vs startups describe and use context.
- **Run numbers** → Check which levers actually improve outcomes in experiments.
- **Cross-pollinate** → Bring in ideas from psychology, HCI, info retrieval, etc. to explain what’s happening.
- **Validate** → Share your draft findings with experts and practitioners to pressure-test them.

👉 *In short: Organize the evidence, find the patterns, and check you’re not fooling yourself.*

---

### **Stage 4 — Sharing What You Found (the output)**
Finally, you **package the knowledge** so others can use it.

- **Landscape report** → The “big picture” map of what context engineering is and isn’t.
- **Toolkit** → Checklists, playbooks, and design recipes for practitioners.
- **Case study library** → Concrete examples from startups and labs.
- **Workshops/briefings** → Ways to spread the findings to leaders, engineers, designers.

👉 *In short: Turn your research into clear guides, stories, and tools that others can use.*

---

🔑 **Super-simplified metaphor**:

1. **Stage 1: Plan the trip** (pick your map, routes, and rules).
2. **Stage 2: Collect souvenirs** (papers, interviews, product teardowns, experiments).
3. **Stage 3: Sort the souvenirs** (group them, analyze patterns, connect dots).
4. **Stage 4: Make a travel guide** (share the highlights, tips, and lessons with others).

---

Would you like me to also **draw this as a one-page visual map/diagram** so you can see the flow at a glance, instead of just reading it in text?

## You (2025-08-17T06:31:46.877000+00:00)

We have decided to conduct our research utilizing ChatGPT as a primary tool. I would appreciate your objective analysis of the outcomes from Stage 1, following a careful review of the three files provided in the attached link. I have some concerns regarding the results, but I intend to present them without bias. Please consider this as you, in your capacity as a professor, assess the work of a student.

You can access the three files, which serve as supplementary data for Stage 2, at the following link:

## ChatGPT (2025-08-17T06:32:57.076935+00:00)

Got it. I reviewed the three Stage-1 files in that repo and I’ll give you a clean, professor-style critique: what’s strong, what’s risky, and the concrete fixes I’d prioritize before you move into Stage 2.

---

# What’s strong (you set yourselves up well)

- **Clear research focus and scope.** The Stage-1 README crisply states purpose, payoff, an LLM-era scope, and the core RQs. It also operationalizes the five primary levers plus secondary ones, which will prevent hand-wavy coding later.
- **Operational definitions (taxonomy)** with examples/non-examples for each lever. This is gold for inter-coder consistency and later ablations.
- **Method discipline end-to-end.** Inclusion/exclusion criteria, credibility tiers, sampling strategy (systematic + snowball + stratified + theoretical), PRISMA flow, and quality gates are all present and specific.
- **Instrumentation is practical and complete.** Screening form, coding sheet (aligned to the JSON schema), interview guide, survey bank, case-study template, risk register, and even experiment skeletons are ready. This is unusually thorough for a V1.
- **Data spec is thoughtful.** The JSON Schema covers IDs, domains, lever tags (including emergent tags), methods, metrics, risks, governance signals, export formats, and an inter-coder reliability plan (κ target, adjudication steps). Examples are included—great for dry runs.

---

# Where you’re exposed (gaps, ambiguities, likely pain points)

1. **Over-tight keyword logic risks false negatives at screening.**
   The `NonContextTopic` rule leans on title/abstract keywords; many solid HCI/IR papers won’t say “context” explicitly. Expect misses unless reviewers can override with guidance. Add concrete synonym lists and a “semantic similarity” backstop procedure.

2. **Venue/credibility mapping is a bit brittle.**
   Tiers keyed to “top venues” + org types can down-rank rigorous grey literature (e.g., strong industry evals) and non-English venues. Add an evidence-based override rubric (methods + artifacts trump venue) and explicitly allow non-English sources with translation notes.

3. **Groundedness vs. faithfulness needs harmonized definitions.**
   You list both but don’t standardize how coders should identify or prefer one metric vs. another across sources—this will create synthesis noise. Add canonical definitions + mapping to common proxies (e.g., citation-matching vs. human justification checks).

4. **Sampling quotas are ambitious and may bias the corpus.**
   Minimums like “≥40 per primary lever” can push coders toward borderline inclusions, and the per-org cap may under-represent major labs that dominate certain levers. Pilot the quotas; convert some to targets with stopping rules tied to saturation and κ stability.

5. **Emergent tag promotion rule is unproven.**
   “≥5 records ⇒ formalize” could lock in noisy categories. Require cross-coder agreement and cross-domain presence (e.g., 5 records across ≥2 domains and ≥2 org types) before promotion.

6. **Risk/governance signals are well listed but unevenly actionable.**
   You’ll code “third_party_audit,” “policy_alignment,” etc.—but many sources won’t disclose these. Add “unknown/not stated” and capture *evidence source* (claims vs. artifact) to avoid optimistic bias.

7. **ChatGPT-as-primary-tool risks (drift, leakage, hallucinated extraction) not yet addressed in protocol.**
   You mention traceability and κ, but not the *LLM extraction process* itself (model version logging, double-pass extraction, human verification). Add a tool-use SOP (below).

8. **Ambiguity at the edges of levers.**
   For example, “Selection” (filtering out low-quality docs) sits between Injection and Weighting but isn’t named; you rely on non-examples. Add an explicit “selection/filtration” sub-code to keep boundaries clean.

---

# Concrete fixes I’d make for V1.1 (quick wins)

**A. Screening & coding reliability**
- Expand `NonContextTopic` with a controlled synonym list (e.g., “prompt orchestration,” “tool routing,” “planner,” “context window,” “memory,” “knowledge grounding,” “guardrails,” “policy prompts,” “retrieval”). Add a human-review fallback whenever semantic match > threshold or venue/methods look relevant.
- Add a **pilot run**: 30–50 mixed items, double-coded, report κ per field; freeze codebook once κ≥0.75, then start the main ingest. (You already plan κ, just formalize the pilot gate.)

**B. Metric harmonization**
- Add a mini-glossary for **faithfulness vs. groundedness** (what evidence each requires, acceptable proxies) and a decision tree for coding when papers use idiosyncratic metrics.

**C. Adjust quotas from hard minimums to evidence-sensitive targets**
- Convert some per-lever quotas to **targets with saturation checks** (e.g., stop when 3 additional items yield <5% new subcodes for that lever). Keeps quality > quantity.

**D. Clarify “selection/filtration”**
- Add `selection_filtration` as a secondary or sub-code under Injection to capture pruning/quality filters distinctly from reranking (Weighting).

**E. Governance/risk coding hygiene**
- For each governance or risk tag, require an **evidence_type** field: {artifact, explicit statement, inference}. Add “not stated.” This will keep downstream analyses honest.

**F. ChatGPT tool-use SOP (Stage-2-ready)**
- Log **model fingerprint** (provider, model, exact version, date/time) on every extraction.
- Use **two-pass extraction**: (1) structured pull to the schema; (2) verification pass that quotes the exact passage/figure/table supporting each coded field.
- Enforce **source-linked citations** in the coded record (URL + anchor/section).
- Run **consistency checks** (e.g., IDs unique, date formats, arrays non-empty where required) and a **random 10% human audit** per batch.

---

# “Professor” assessment (snap verdict)

- **Rigor:** A- (excellent scaffolding; needs reliability pilot + metric harmonization to hit A).
- **Clarity:** A- (taxonomy is clear; add selection/filtration and tighten metric definitions).
- **Feasibility:** B+ (ambitious quotas/targets; make them conditional on saturation to avoid low-value inclusions).
- **Reproducibility/Traceability:** A- (great JSON schema and export spec; add LLM tool-use SOP).
- **Bias & Coverage:** B (venue-centric tiering and English-language bias are likely; add explicit multilingual/grey-lit paths).

---

# Stage-2 readiness checklist (use this before you start)

- [ ] Pilot screen + code 30–50 items; publish κ per unit and codebook changes.
- [ ] Adopt ChatGPT extraction SOP (model fingerprinting, two-pass extraction, human spot-checks).
- [ ] Add metric glossary + decision tree for groundedness/faithfulness and common proxies.
- [ ] Convert hard quotas to targets with saturation rules; document stopping criteria.
- [ ] Expand screening synonyms; enable human review for semantic matches.
- [ ] Add `selection_filtration` sub-code and update examples/non-examples.
- [ ] Add evidence_type to risk/governance tags; allow “not stated.”

---

If you want, I can mark up your JSON schema and README with these edits inline (e.g., add `selection_filtration`, metric glossary appendix, and the ChatGPT SOP section) so your Stage-1 “V1.1” is truly plug-and-play for Stage 2.

## You (2025-08-17T06:35:25.172000+00:00)

ok, could you explain this outcome to me in simple terms? Cuz while I want a research, this goes a few leaps beyond my knowledge to the point where I feel like something's wrong but i don't know how to identify it.

## ChatGPT (2025-08-17T06:35:26.254774+00:00)

Totally fair — the feedback I gave was written in a very “professorly” way, which makes it sound heavier than it actually is. Let me step back and explain the outcome of your Stage 1 in **plain, simple language**, so you can see both what’s good and where the rough spots are without feeling overwhelmed.

---

### **The Good News (what you got right)**
- **Clear focus.** You’ve nailed down what you want to study (how people engineer “context” into AI systems) and broken it into manageable pieces (“framing, injection, structuring, weighting, boundaries”). That’s a great start.
- **Solid structure.** You wrote down rules for what papers to include, how to tag them, and how to capture extra details (like risks, evaluation methods, or governance). This makes your process more professional than just “reading around.”
- **Tools are ready.** You already drafted checklists, templates, and even a data format for recording what you find. That’s more preparation than most early-stage projects have.

👉 In short: You’ve built a strong foundation and avoided the classic “we’ll figure it out later” trap.

---

### **Where It Feels a Bit Off (the tricky parts)**
Here’s why you (rightly) feel like something is “off” — you’ve got a **very ambitious research plan** for a first run. The issues aren’t fatal, but they’re like trying to sprint before you’ve walked.

1. **You might miss important stuff.**
   Your screening rules look for obvious keywords like “context” — but many relevant papers won’t actually use that word (they might say “prompt orchestration” or “retrieval”). So you risk excluding useful work just because of how it’s phrased.

2. **Some definitions are fuzzy.**
   Terms like “groundedness” and “faithfulness” overlap, and unless you lock down what they mean in your project, you’ll end up with messy, inconsistent coding later.

3. **Targets are a bit rigid.**
   You set numeric goals like “at least 40 papers per lever.” That sounds good, but it might push you to include borderline or low-value papers just to hit the quota, rather than focusing on quality.

4. **Your categories aren’t 100% complete.**
   For example, you don’t yet have a clear place for “selection/filtration” (filtering out low-quality sources). Right now, it doesn’t cleanly fit under injection or weighting, which could confuse coders.

5. **You’re leaning heavily on ChatGPT itself.**
   That’s fine, but you don’t yet have a solid “safety procedure” for using it as your extraction tool (e.g., making sure it doesn’t hallucinate, drift, or silently skip details). Without guardrails, that could undermine your data quality.

👉 In short: You’ve got the map and gear, but the compass is a bit fuzzy, and you’re asking yourselves to cover too much terrain too fast.

---

### **How to Think About This Simply**
Imagine you’re building a house:

- **Foundation (Stage 1)** — You poured concrete, set up the frame, and made a clear floor plan. That’s solid.
- **The issues** — A couple of your measurements are imprecise, and you’re insisting on building 10 rooms even if only 6 are practical at first. Also, your tape measure (ChatGPT) sometimes lies, so you need a second check.

It doesn’t mean your house will collapse — just that you should **tighten a few things before moving to Stage 2**, or you’ll waste effort later fixing misaligned walls.

---

✅ **Bottom line in plain terms:**
Your Stage 1 is **really strong groundwork**. The problems aren’t about “doing it wrong,” they’re about being **too ambitious and a little too rigid**. If you loosen the quotas, clean up a couple fuzzy definitions, and add a safety check for ChatGPT outputs, you’ll be in excellent shape to move forward.

---

Do you want me to **make you a simplified “Stage 1 corrections checklist”** — basically 5–6 quick fixes you can focus on, without all the research jargon? That way you’ll know exactly what to adjust before diving into Stage 2.

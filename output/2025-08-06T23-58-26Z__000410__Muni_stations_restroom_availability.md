I wasn’t able to find any definitive sources indicating that **regular Muni Metro (i.e., standalone Muni-only) stations** in San Francisco offer public restrooms. However, here's what I discovered:

---

###  BART + Muni Shared Stations with Restrooms

These combined BART and Muni Metro stations **do** have restrooms:

- **Powell Street Station**: Underground restrooms reopened on February 2, 2022, following a major station renovation.citeturn0search22  
- **Embarcadero Station**: The bathroom reopened on **June 30, 2023**, with an attendant on duty during operating hours.citeturn0search23

These are part of the shared BART–Muni network under Market Street and are accessible to riders of both systems.

###  Muni-Only Stations

There’s **no indication** that standalone Muni Metro stations (like Castro, Church, etc.) offer public restrooms:

- **Castro Station**, for example, has no mention of restroom facilities in its detailed station description.citeturn0search27

###  Public Restrooms Nearby (Non-Station)

While traditional Muni stations don’t include restrooms, there are several **public restrooms in the city**, including those near transit corridors:

- The **Public Works "Pit Stop" program** places staffed, clean public toilet facilities in areas like the Tenderloin, Mission, and near Market Street—but **these are separate from Muni stations**.citeturn0search3turn0search9  
- San Francisco Public Works also lists several **public restroom locations** on streets and plazas such as:  
  - Market & Powell  
  - Civic Center (Grove & Larkin)  
  - Fisherman’s Wharf, and more.citeturn0search9  
- LocalWiki similarly catalogs public restroom spots including **Sixth & Mission**, **16th Street BART station**, **24th Street BART station**, and others—but again, not within Muni Metro stations.citeturn0search7

###  Summary Table

| **Station Type**                | **Restroom Availability**                          |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Shared BART + Muni Stations    | **Yes** – Restrooms exist at Powell and Embarcadero |
| Standalone Muni Metro Stations | **No** – No public restrooms at these stations    |
| Public Restrooms Nearby        | **Yes** – Via city facilities like Pit Stops, street-side restrooms |

---

**In short:**  
- **Powell Street** and **Embarcadero** (shared BART/Muni stations) *do* offer restrooms.  
- **Standalone Muni-only stations** do *not* appear to have public restrooms.  
- If you need facilities, you’ll need to rely on nearby city amenities like street-restrooms or Pit Stops—not stations themselves.

Absolutely—if you're at Civic Center, here’s a **guaranteed and clearly marked** public restroom option right nearby:

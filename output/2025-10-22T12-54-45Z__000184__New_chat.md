help me understand the difference between codex cli, and codex gpt 5

Good question — and it’s an important one because “Codex CLI” and “Codex GPT-5” are *very different layers* of the OpenAI ecosystem, even though both relate to code understanding and generation.  

Let’s unpack it clearly:

---

### 🧩 1. **Codex (CLI)**  
**Codex CLI** isn’t a model — it’s a **command-line interface tool**.  
It’s basically a *developer utility* that lets you talk to OpenAI models from your terminal.

- **What it does:**  
  It takes your commands (like `codex run` or `codex edit`) and sends them to a model via the API.  
  It’s just a *wrapper around the API* — a way to use GPT models (including GPT-4 or GPT-5) in a coding-friendly way.  
- **Purpose:**  
  Make it easier for developers to:
  - Generate or edit code files directly from the terminal  
  - Run interactive coding sessions  
  - Use GPT’s coding ability in a local development workflow  
- **Think of it as:**  
  🧰 A *tool* to access the model — not a model itself.

**Example:**
```bash
codex edit main.py --instructions "Add a function that sorts a list of numbers"
```
This command calls an OpenAI model behind the scenes (possibly GPT-5), applies your instruction, and updates `main.py`.

---

### 🧠 2. **Codex (the model, now part of GPT-5)**  
“Codex” originally referred to a **specialized model family** (in GPT-3 era) fine-tuned for code.  
It powered GitHub Copilot and could write code in many languages.

Now, **GPT-5 includes Codex-level reasoning natively** — meaning:
- There’s no separate “Codex model” anymore.  
- GPT-5 *absorbs* those capabilities (code synthesis, debugging, natural-language-to-code, etc.).
- It’s much more powerful and context-aware than the old Codex (which was roughly GPT-3.5-level).

**In short:**  
> “Codex GPT-5” isn’t a standalone thing — it means *GPT-5 with Codex-style code reasoning built in.*

### ⚖️ Summary

| Feature | Codex CLI | Codex (in GPT-5) |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Type** | Command-line tool | Model capability |
| **Purpose** | Interface for API calls | Code understanding/generation |
| **Depends on** | The model you choose (e.g., GPT-5) | None — it *is* the model |
| **Analogy** | Like a “remote control” | Like the “TV” itself |
| **Example use** | `codex run script.py` | “Write a React component for a login form.” |

If you want, I can show you **how to install and use Codex CLI with GPT-5** for a local coding workflow (including example commands, token management, and project setup).

# Scenario Analysis and Flow

## You (2025-05-27T11:49:24.054000+00:00)

You are an experienced interaction designer and scenario builder. Your job is to review a Google Sheets document I provide, containing user stories or abstract user statements.

For each row in the Google Sheets document:

* Carefully read and understand the user story.
* Imagine the user's real-world context, motivations, and goals clearly and vividly.
* Analyze the likely interaction flow needed to achieve the user's stated intent.
* Identify possible edge cases, exceptions, or error conditions relevant to that scenario.
* Clearly outline the successful outcome the user achieves after interacting with the interface.

Provide your analysis for each user story in the following clear, structured format:

Scenario: \[Brief descriptive title summarizing the interaction]

User Motivation:
"As a \[User Role], I want \[action or functionality], so that \[specific user benefit or value]."

Flow:

1. \[Step-by-step user actions and system responses, numbered clearly.]
2. \[Next step/action...]
...
...
...

Edge Cases:

* \[Clearly list each important edge-case, alternate path, or potential error the user might encounter during the interaction.]

Outcome:
\[Briefly describe the successful result or value the user achieves from this scenario.]

Ensure each scenario is concise, thoughtful, and considers realistic conditions and contexts.

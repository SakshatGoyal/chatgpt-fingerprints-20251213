## ChatGPT (2025-11-12T10:16:29.839005+00:00)

I researched a broad array of current Expedia coupon codes from multiple reputable coupon aggregators (CouponFollow, SimplyCodes, RentalPerks, Groupon and Expedia itself) and tested all the codes that appeared to offer monetary discounts on a stand‑alone hotel booking.  Below is a summary of the codes I found and their eligibility notes (with citations):

- **CFNYC10** – A coupon code widely reported to give 10 % off New‑York‑city hotels【39214895489393†L124-L133】.  
- **CFVEGAS10** – A code intended to provide 10 % off Las Vegas hotels【39214895489393†L108-L117】.  
- **CFCANCUN10** – Reported to give 10 % off Cancun hotels【39214895489393†L124-L133】.  
- **8RENTALPERKS / RENTALPERKS8** – A general 8 % discount for select hotels【39214895489393†L301-L304】.  
- **EXPAPP10** – Expedia’s mobile‑app coupon for 10 % off select hotels【39214895489393†L309-L312】.  
- **OV8** – An 8 % off hotel coupon noted on CouponFollow【39214895489393†L124-L133】.  
- **BOFA5** – A 5 % off code reported by SimplyCodes (recently used by other customers)【39214895489393†L137-L173】.  
- **BEXJERRY** – Expedia’s own 8 % off voucher (expired Dec 31 2023)【136245009189403†L7-L18】.  
- **RMNAUGUST8** – An 8 % off code listed by Expedia for travel through Jan 31 2025【774782750541150†L7-L16】.  

I then systematically applied each of these codes in the coupon dialog on your current Expedia checkout page. For each code, I used the coupon input field and clicked “Apply” to see if it would reduce the total price.  Unfortunately, the site returned error messages for all codes tested:

- **CFNYC10**, **CFVEGAS10**, **CFCANCUN10** – “Sorry, this coupon is not valid for this destination.”  
- **8RENTALPERKS / RENTALPERKS8**, **EXPAPP10**, **OV8** – The site indicated the coupons were expired or only valid via specific referral links and therefore not accepted.  
- **BOFA5** – Expedia reported the coupon code as invalid.  
- **BEXJERRY** and **RMNAUGUST8** – Both codes are expired (the terms specify redemption periods ending in 2023 and early 2025 respectively【136245009189403†L16-L19】【774782750541150†L13-L16】), so they could not be applied.

After testing these coupons, none applied to your current hotel booking; the total remained $115.90.  Based on the exhaustive search and testing, there appears to be **no active coupon code applicable to this specific destination and stay**.  The best way to secure a discount would be to use Expedia’s Member Prices (One Key program) or book during promotional windows such as Black Friday/Cyber Monday.  If you discover a new code in the future, feel free to provide it and I can test it for you.

# Executive Profile: The Midsized Apparel Company CEO

## Identity Basics
Early career experiences often set the foundation for a midsized apparel CEO’s strategic mindset. Many followed unconventional paths before taking the helm. For example, **Rose Marcario** (former CEO of Patagonia) started in finance but felt unfulfilled and pivoted after a wake-up call – stuck in a New York taxi, irritated at a slow pedestrian, she caught her reflection and thought *“I don’t even like who this person is anymore”*【12†L139-L147】. This moment pushed her to seek meaningful work, eventually leading Patagonia with a mission-driven ethos. Similarly, **Michael Preysman** of Everlane began in private equity but had a “nagging feeling” it wasn’t his calling; he listed people he admired and realized none were financiers. He decided *“I can make a ton of money here, but is this what I want to be doing with my life?”*, a pivotal realization that prompted him to start Everlane at 25【28†L91-L99】. Such early inflection points instill in these leaders a drive to build companies aligned with personal values rather than just profit.

These CEOs’ leadership identities balance big-company discipline with entrepreneurial agility. Many midsized apparel chiefs have worn multiple hats in their rise, unlike specialists at large corporations. Marcario’s transition from CFO to COO to CEO at Patagonia forced her to be *“operationally-minded”* beyond just numbers【12†L154-L163】. **Jennifer Hyman** of Rent the Runway cut her teeth at a large firm (Starwood Hotels) but in an intrapreneurial role – at 22, she pitched and built a new honeymoon registry business by rallying hundreds of colleagues with no direct authority【23†L231-L239】【23†L240-L248】. This trial by fire taught her how to influence and inspire without the formal power a big-company CEO might wield. In contrast to a startup founder who might make ad-hoc decisions or a Fortune-500 CEO who has layers of support, the midsize CEO often personally bridges strategy and execution. They remain close enough to the ground to understand operational realities, yet have enough scale to implement structured strategies. As **Chip Bergh** (CEO of Levi Strauss) observed after 28 years at Procter & Gamble, leading a midsize heritage brand meant adopting a more hands-on, transparent approach than the top-down style he saw in mega-corporations【16†L75-L84】【16†L87-L90】. In short, these leaders blend the scrappiness of a startup founder with the seasoned judgment of a big-company executive, a hybrid identity shaped by early formative experiences and the unique demands of mid-tier companies.

## Tone & Style
Midsized apparel CEOs develop a flexible communication style, adapting their tone to different audiences and circumstances. In growth mode or when rallying teams around a vision, their narrative is often optimistic and inspiring. **Jennifer Hyman** speaks with passionate optimism about Rent the Runway’s mission – she calls the company *“my first child, the love of my life”*, and evangelizes changing how women feel about themselves through fashion【25†L597-L605】. Her day-to-day language with employees is filled with enthusiasm for the *“big vision”* and recognition of the *“blood, sweat, and tears”* everyone invested to pioneer a new market【25†L599-L607】. This positivity helps motivate teams in good times. Similarly, Everlane’s Michael Preysman adopts a straightforward, values-driven tone with customers – *“People want truth. There’s a lack of trust… we wanted to figure out our way of dealing with it”*, he recalls of launching transparent pricing【28†L108-L116】【28†L110-L118】. His public communications often educate consumers about supply chain ethics in a plainspoken, earnest manner that builds credibility.

However, these leaders readily shift tone in adversity, mixing candor with reassurance. When crisis strikes, they tend to communicate hard truths honestly while still projecting hope. Hyman recalls that when COVID-19 hit and Rent the Runway’s revenue plummeted 80% virtually overnight, she had to **“ground [the team] in reality”** about the severity of the situation *and* simultaneously **“inspire the team with hope”**【25†L623-L631】. In Zoom meetings she was frank that *“this is going to be really bad for us for a long time”*, yet in the next breath she emphasized that their vision would still matter post-pandemic and the downtime was a chance to innovate for a stronger future【25†L627-L635】. This balance of sobering honesty and forward-looking optimism is a hallmark of their crisis communication style.

Their linguistic style also varies by audience. With frontline employees, midsize CEOs often favor transparent, no-spin talk. Chip Bergh emphasizes being *“really transparent and straight with people”*, giving direct feedback and not sugar-coating performance issues【16†L81-L89】. He believes candor builds trust over time and openly tells teams where they need to improve, reflecting a blunt-yet-supportive tone. In public forums or interviews, many adopt a narrative storytelling style – for instance, **Eileen Fisher** (founder of her eponymous fashion brand) speaks softly and reflectively, framing business moves as extensions of personal values or life stories (such as moving her office to have a backyard for her son, an anecdote she uses to illustrate putting family values first【31†L132-L141】【31†L139-L144】). Overall, their tone toggles between approachable and visionary, with a notable shift when navigating turmoil: in stable times they radiate enthusiasm and clarity of purpose, whereas in adversity they become more somber, candid, and rally their troops with a tempered *“we will overcome this together”* message.

## Behavioral Patterns
When making decisions under pressure or uncertainty, midsized apparel CEOs exhibit consistent behavioral patterns. One common approach during crises is decisive action after a period of quick learning. These leaders often gather input rapidly, then pivot fast. For example, when Levi’s was struggling, Chip Bergh began by **“sleuthing”** for root problems – upon joining, he interviewed the top 60 people with questions like *“What are three things we must change? Three we must keep?”*【19†L113-L121】. Armed with this intel on the company’s DNA and values, he formed a clear turnaround plan. But once decisions were ripe, he acted boldly. Bergh is known for *“never regretting moving too fast to let somebody go”* when a team member isn’t working out, but he has regretted waiting too long【19†L99-L107】. This highlights a pattern: in high-stakes moments, he evaluates quickly and then errs on the side of swift, decisive moves – whether restructuring teams or killing failing initiatives – rather than prolonged hesitation.

In data-limited scenarios or unprecedented situations, many midsize CEOs blend analysis with intuition. They often start by analyzing whatever information is available, but are willing to rely on experience and core principles when data is sparse. During the early pandemic, Jennifer Hyman initially tried a data-driven approach – brainstorming marketing ideas to retain customers – but soon realized no historical data could will demand back. She needed a reality check (helped by her husband’s remark, *“no one is going to rent clothes right now”*) and then fundamentally shifted strategy【25†L619-L627】. She recounts that the **“first lesson”** in crisis was accepting reality, which for her meant abandoning wishful tactics and instead “becoming the most decisive version” of herself【25†L623-L631】【25†L639-L647】. In practice, that meant making dozens of tough calls daily to cut costs, streamline operations, and **“slice away”** non-core parts of the business【25†L639-L647】. Hyman’s behavior under duress – rapid decision velocity focused on the essentials – is echoed by others. Midsize CEOs generally take charge in emergencies and impose clarity through action.

At the same time, they often keep contingency plans and show a pattern of learning from each decision. Because their companies are big enough to have complexity but small enough to pivot, these CEOs frequently pilot ideas, learn, and iterate. **Katrina Lake** of Stitch Fix exemplified this experimental decisiveness: she introduced algorithmic styling but *insisted on a hybrid approach*, letting human stylists override the algorithm’s picks to improve outcomes【7†L550-L556】. In essence, she made a firm decision to integrate AI into the business model, but monitored results and adjusted the balance of human vs. machine input over time. This reflects a broader behavior pattern of *“act, learn, and adjust.”* Whether dealing with supply chain disruptions or a fickle fashion trend, midsized apparel CEOs tend to act decisively on the best available insight, yet remain nimble to recalibrate if the first approach falters. In crisis or uncertainty, they are neither paralyzed by analysis nor blindly reckless – instead, they combine quick decisive moves with an adaptive mindset, guided by both data and seasoned intuition.

## Values & Motivations
Deeply held values and motivations are a driving force in how these executives make strategic choices. Many midsize apparel CEOs explicitly foreground values like sustainability, quality, or social impact, allowing these ideals to guide decisions even when it costs more or slows growth. **Michael Preysman**’s philosophy at Everlane, for instance, is *“radical transparency”* – a commitment that led Everlane to wait six years to launch denim until they found an ethical factory that recycles 98% of its water【28†L64-L72】. This value of doing things the right way shaped a major product decision, sacrificing short-term sales to uphold sustainability standards. Preysman also pledged to remove all virgin plastic from Everlane’s supply chain by 2021, reflecting how an environmental value became a concrete strategic goal【28†L64-L72】【28†L70-L74】. He believes transparency *“leads to the right decision in the long term, but it makes it harder in the short term”*【28†L124-L128】 – a testament to prioritizing long-term ethics over immediate convenience.

Similarly, Patagonia’s leadership embodies values-centric decision-making. Founder Yvon Chouinard and CEOs like Rose Marcario have long put planet over profit. Patagonia pioneered use of organic cotton and traceable, ethically sourced materials even when these were more expensive, and became one of California’s first Benefit Corporations to legally enshrine its social/environmental mission【9†L71-L79】. Marcario articulates her guiding belief as creating a **“synergistic ecosystem”** where *“people, planet, and meaningful work”* all thrive together【12†L181-L189】. This worldview means Patagonia’s leaders routinely make trade-offs in favor of environmental or social good – whether donating a sizable chunk of profits to grassroots environmental nonprofits or providing on-site childcare for employees as a non-negotiable expense【9†L73-L81】. Their motivation goes beyond financial metrics; as Marcario puts it, *“we live in an interconnected world”* and business should be a force for positive change【12†L186-L194】.

Personal motivations like innovation and legacy also loom large. Many of these CEOs see themselves as change-makers or pioneers. Jennifer Hyman, for example, is driven by a mission to redefine fashion consumption (creating a “Closet in the Cloud”). She openly states she built her company to *“change the way that people feel about themselves every day”*, indicating a motivation rooted in empowering customers rather than just running a clothing rental service【25†L597-L605】. This sense of purpose becomes a compass for strategic trade-offs: during the pandemic, the belief that Rent the Runway *“deserved to exist”* for the benefit of its community fueled her relentless fight to save the company【25†L639-L647】. **Eileen Fisher** is motivated by a desire to “do good” through business – her brand’s success is measured by its positive impact on employees and the planet, not just revenue【31†L118-L125】. Consequently, she fosters a culture of kindness (no one stays at the company if “they aren’t kind”【31†L139-L144】) and invests in programs like recycling clothing and a leadership institute for young women【34†L265-L273】【34†L267-L275】, aligning operations with her values of care and empowerment.

In guiding strategic trade-offs, these motivations often tilt decisions towards legacy and principle. A growth-at-all-costs mindset is less common; instead, midsize apparel CEOs often pursue **sustainable growth** that can be proudly sustained over decades. They seek to build a brand legacy – be it Everlane’s legacy of transparency changing industry norms【28†L108-L116】 or Levi’s revitalization as an iconic American brand that also stands for social responsibility (Bergh took public stances on issues like gun safety out of a sense of moral duty to employees and customers【46†L274-L282】). In sum, their values (ethical sourcing, transparency, community, etc.) act as guardrails, and their motivations (innovation, leaving a positive mark) serve as fuel. These factors strongly influence strategic choices, often leading to courageous stands or patient long-term investments that define who they are as leaders and the legacy they hope to create.

## Exemplars & Anecdotes
Real-world stories offer a window into how midsized apparel CEOs navigate high-pressure decisions and demonstrate resilience. One vivid example is **Jennifer Hyman’s** handling of the COVID-19 crisis at Rent the Runway. In March 2020, as lockdowns caused an *“80 percent of our revenue [to vanish] overnight”*, Hyman initially scrambled for solutions【25†L609-L617】【25†L611-L619】. After a few frantic weeks, she experienced a turning point: still in denial, she was brainstorming promotions when her husband pointed out she’d been wearing pajamas for two months – a stark reminder that customers stuck at home weren’t thinking about fashion rentals【25†L619-L627】. That hard dose of reality spurred an anecdote-worthy pivot. Hyman shifted from trying to salvage short-term sales to radically restructuring the business. She later described spending the next months making painful decisions: *“We needed to let go of hundreds of people, which was incredibly difficult… [and] let go of lots of workstreams”* in order to **“simplify the business”**【26†L650-L658】. By laser-focusing on just three priorities, she transformed Rent the Runway during its darkest hour and ultimately kept it afloat【26†L650-L658】. This story illustrates her resilience and adaptability – turning a near-death business experience into a reinvention that even led to a successful IPO in 2021【26†L659-L667】.

Another exemplar is **Chip Bergh’s** dramatic turnaround of Levi Strauss. When Bergh took over in 2011, Levi’s was a fading brand facing declining sales. He started by interviewing dozens of employees to diagnose issues, which revealed a muddled strategy and low morale【19†L113-L121】. Bergh then made bold moves, such as overhauling the executive team (*“surround yourself with people who can lead”* was his mantra【19†L133-L142】) and cutting underperforming product lines. A memorable anecdote from his first year: Bergh scheduled one-hour meetings with each of the top 60 leaders, asking pointed questions (what to change, what to keep, what they feared or expected of him)【19†L115-L123】. By the end of this exhaustive listening tour, he says, *“I was really clear about the company’s DNA, and the values that were really important to everyone here.”*【19†L117-L124】 Armed with that clarity, he unified the team around Levi’s core identity of quality and authenticity. Over the ensuing years, Bergh’s decisiveness (including difficult layoffs and firings he felt were necessary【19†L99-L107】) and transparency rebuilt trust. Levi’s resurgence – capped by returning to the public stock market after decades and regaining cultural relevance – stands as an example of steady leadership under pressure. Bergh himself often cites *“trial and error”* and learning from mistakes as key; indeed, he shares that he has *“some great turnaround stories where people were coached and raised their game”*, showing his willingness to give chances even as he pushed for excellence【19†L99-L107】.

In values-driven decision-making, **Everlane’s journey** provides illustrative anecdotes. Preysman’s insistence on ethical production led to a famous example: Everlane refused to sell denim until it could do so without dirty manufacturing. It wasn’t until they found a Vietnam factory that could recycle the vast majority of water and use renewable energy that Everlane finally launched jeans in 2017【28†L64-L72】. This was almost lore in the industry – a CEO turning away revenue for years to stay true to a principle. Another anecdote occurred after the **Rana Plaza factory collapse** in 2013, which killed over 1,100 garment workers in Bangladesh. In the wake of this tragedy, Everlane doubled down on revealing its own factories and costs. *“Within three months of launch, Everlane was providing customers with pricing transparency, followed by factory transparency in 2013… That’s when we realized that transparency was our form of communication with the customer,”* Preysman recalls【28†L117-L124】【28†L121-L128】. The Rana Plaza incident was a crucible moment; rather than shy away, Everlane’s leadership chose to confront the issue head-on by educating customers about where each product was made and why it cost what it did. This anecdote shows the CEO’s belief that being honest about uncomfortable issues (like labor conditions) would build long-term trust with consumers, even if it invited scrutiny.

Examples of resilience and adaptability abound. **Patagonia’s leaders** have stories of making unconventional decisions under pressure – for instance, after a year of record sales, they ran a full-page ad titled “Don’t Buy This Jacket” urging customers to buy less and reduce consumption, a bold move that paradoxically deepened loyalty to the brand’s mission. And when supply chain scandals hit competitors, Patagonia proactively audited its own supply chain for human rights, setting new standards (like publishing the Footprint Chronicles, an online tool to trace the impact of each product). **Eileen Fisher’s leadership** is illustrated in anecdotes of personal growth and change: known to be a shy person, she nevertheless stepped forward to publicly champion mindfulness and collaboration in her company. She even transitioned the company to a collaborative leadership model with a team of co-leaders, an unusual move that underscored her commitment to inclusivity over ego【34†L236-L244】【34†L243-L251】. One story has Fisher sitting quietly through contentious meetings, letting debates swirl, and then calmly synthesizing the group’s input into a decisive action – demonstrating patience and confidence in collective wisdom. These varied stories – from crisis pivots and turnarounds to principled stands – all highlight the nuanced decision-making of midsize apparel CEOs. Under pressure, they lean on their values and adapt quickly, leaving a trail of instructive anecdotes that define their leadership legacy.

## Strategic & Analytical Reasoning
Midsized fashion CEOs are often highly analytical strategists who use a mix of formal frameworks and intuitive mental models to chart their company’s course. They commonly start by analyzing the competitive landscape and internal capabilities, often via straightforward but effective frameworks. For example, when mapping out Rent the Runway’s post-pandemic strategy, **Jennifer Hyman** employed analogy as a strategic tool. She likened the emerging *“circular fashion”* market to transportation options: just as consumers can choose to own a car, rent one, or take a taxi depending on need, she explained that in fashion *“ownership…should be for high-utility items,”* whereas rental can fill short-term wardrobe needs【26†L669-L677】【26†L678-L687】. By comparing wardrobes to a portfolio of options (rent, resale, own), she created a mental model to decide where Rent the Runway fits versus resale competitors. This analytical framing helped clarify differentiation and is an example of using conceptual models to guide strategy.

Many of these CEOs also apply systematic approaches internally. **Chip Bergh**, in executing Levi’s turnaround, essentially performed a SWOT analysis by asking leaders what to change or keep and what they feared【19†L115-L123】. Through those interviews he distilled the company’s core strengths (its brand heritage and values) and weaknesses (siloed teams, outdated styles). This process gave him a strategic north star – to double down on Levi’s authentic, timeless appeal while pruning distractions. He also emphasizes hiring for **“intellectual curiosity”**, probing executive candidates on how they solve problems and learn【19†L137-L145】. This indicates he values strategic thinkers who use rigorous reasoning and ask questions, not just give orders【19†L139-L146】. In practice, Bergh’s strategic reasoning often surfaces as clear-cut principles: be transparent, diagnose the real problem before fixing it, and empower strong leaders to execute【19†L108-L116】【19†L131-L139】. These principles function like frameworks guiding decisions on culture and operations.

Delegation patterns in midsize firms often reflect a divide between strategic and operational decisions. **Eileen Fisher’s** collaborative model is one illustration: she “insists on hearing voices from lots of different people” in strategy discussions, allowing broad input, but then a *“small team hears it all and makes the decision”*【34†L243-L251】. This approach lets her delegate operational detail to teams while she and a core group make the high-level strategic calls. It’s a balance between inclusivity and decisiveness. Fisher consciously cultivates a *“collaborative process”* and even allows ambiguity (leaving some meetings with decisions “unclear” to let ideas marinate)【34†L243-L251】. But ultimately, a subset (which often includes her) synthesizes the input into action. In contrast, some midsize CEOs with big-company backgrounds take a more top-down approach on strategy but hands-off on operations. They set clear strategic objectives or frameworks (e.g., **Rose Marcario** might set a strategic mandate that Patagonia will only pursue growth that aligns with its environmental mission), and then trust operational leaders to figure out execution details within those guardrails. Marcario’s own rise through CFO/COO roles means she understands operations deeply, but as CEO she focused on visionary strategy – like expanding Patagonia into new mission-aligned ventures (food business, venture fund) – while her team ran day-to-day retail and supply chain【9†L66-L75】【9†L81-L87】.

Most of these CEOs empower functional experts to execute tactics, reserving their own bandwidth for strategic direction and critical trade-offs. **Katrina Lake** provided an example of this delegation balance at Stitch Fix: she let algorithms and data scientists handle granular decisions on personalizing customer shipments, but she defined the strategic model of blending data and human judgment【7†L550-L556】. Essentially, she set the strategy (“personalization at scale” through *both* AI and stylists) and delegated the implementation (the data science, the styling operations) to her teams within that framework. Another common pattern is the use of **cross-functional task forces** or working groups on strategic projects. For instance, when Everlane committed to removing virgin plastic, Preysman likely chartered an internal team to audit all plastic use (from fabric to packaging) and innovate alternatives, while he monitored progress and kept the company accountable to the 2021 goal【28†L69-L77】【28†L71-L79】. This approach allows him to translate a strategic value (sustainability) into concrete operational changes without micromanaging every step. Overall, midsized apparel CEOs leverage analytical reasoning to set a clear strategy – often articulated via memorable models or Q&A frameworks – and then delegate execution to capable teams, intervening only to make the pivotal choices or when course-corrections are needed to uphold the strategy.

## Emotional & Social Guidance
Leading a midsize clothing company isn’t just about products and profits – it’s also about guiding people. These CEOs tend to be highly attuned to organizational culture, morale, and interpersonal dynamics, often acting as the emotional center of their companies. A recurring theme is fostering trust and openness. Chip Bergh emphasizes that **“being extremely transparent builds trust over time”**, and he works hard to instill a culture where issues are surfaced, not whispered about【16†L81-L89】. *“I’m not a big fan of organizations where people backstab or talk behind others’ backs,”* he says, preferring teams to tackle problems collaboratively and honestly【16†L85-L89】. By setting this tone from the top – holding the bar high but also communicating frankly when someone isn’t meeting it – he creates psychological safety in the sense that people know where they stand. This approach to internal conflict is direct: deal with performance problems head-on, but also *“work together to get the best results”* rather than finger-pointing【16†L85-L89】. It shows social intelligence in balancing accountability with unity.

Many midsize apparel CEOs cultivate a familial or values-driven atmosphere to keep morale high. **Eileen Fisher** explicitly treats her company “like a family.” She believes *“business as a movement”* means caring for people, and it shows – her headquarters features open spaces to encourage spontaneous collaboration, a meditation room, yoga classes, and even wellness stipends for employees【34†L281-L288】. *“Wellness is central to the Eileen Fisher mission,”* with perks from massages to flexible workwear allowances【34†L281-L289】. These perks aren’t just fluff; they signal that leadership prioritizes employees’ well-being. Fisher is quoted saying *“nobody lasts at Eileen Fisher…if they aren’t kind.”*【31†L139-L144】 This simple rule sets a tone of mutual respect and empathy. In practice, colleagues are expected to treat each other well, and the company is known for long-tenured staff who stay because they feel cared for. By modeling kindness and requiring it, Fisher defuses the cutthroat tendencies often associated with the fashion industry and instead nurtures an inclusive, supportive culture.

During times of stress or conflict, these CEOs often personally step in to steady the ship emotionally. When hard decisions like layoffs or store closures must be made, they communicate with empathy. Jennifer Hyman, when laying off hundreds during the pandemic, described it as “incredibly difficult”【26†L650-L657】 and has spoken about the emotional toll it took on her, not just the employees. She made a point to explain the rationale transparently to the team and ensured that those leaving were treated with gratitude and dignity. This kind of compassionate leadership helps maintain morale among survivors and preserves trust. **Rose Marcario** similarly integrates empathy into leadership; influenced by her spiritual practice, she talks about avoiding the poisons of *“hatred, ignorance, and greed”* and treating people as you’d want to be treated【12†L186-L194】. In Patagonia’s culture, that means acknowledging employees have lives and families – evidenced by on-site childcare and generous parental leave – which in turn builds immense loyalty【9†L73-L81】【12†L189-L193】. Marcario’s leadership during challenging times often involved rallying employees around shared values (like environmental activism days) to boost collective spirit even if business was tough.

Interpersonally, these CEOs often act as mediators and coaches. In a creative industry like apparel, conflicts can arise (design vs. merchandising, or HQ vs. stores). Leaders like Eileen Fisher permit a bit of *“chaos”* in discussions, believing *“just the right amount of chaos…breeds creativity”*, but she carefully maintains balance so that people feel heard【34†L241-L249】. Everyone gets to voice opinions, and then the leadership finds a path forward, which teaches employees that conflict, when respectful, leads to better outcomes. Moreover, CEOs of midsize firms are often visible and accessible – it’s not uncommon for them to walk the halls, visit stores, or host regular town hall meetings. This presence helps them gauge morale first-hand and also shows employees that the top boss is in it with them. For instance, Chip Bergh’s practice of interviewing dozens of team members upon arrival was not a one-off; he continued to meet with employees at all levels to solicit ideas and feedback【19†L113-L121】, reinforcing a culture of openness. By combining transparency, empathy, and approachability, midsized apparel CEOs provide emotional and social guidance that keeps their organizations cohesive and motivated, even when facing fashion’s fickle markets or internal growing pains.

## Moral & Ethical Reasoning
Navigating ethical dilemmas is a critical part of the job for these CEOs, given the fashion industry’s pitfalls around labor practices, environmental impact, and social issues. Midsized apparel leaders often proactively set ethical standards and confront moral challenges with a principled mindset. **Everlane’s** Michael Preysman provides a clear example of ethics in action. Confronted with the opaque and sometimes exploitative norms of fashion manufacturing, he built Everlane on the idea of *radical transparency*. After disasters like the Rana Plaza collapse exposed horrendous factory conditions, Everlane doubled down on showing consumers its own factory information and costs. Preysman’s stance: *“Transparency gives value and builds trust with the customer and leads to the right decision in the long term”*, even if it complicates things in the short run【28†L124-L128】. This meant revealing which factories they use, auditing those facilities, and being honest about pricing and wages. His ethical framework prioritizes honesty and worker welfare, and he believes educated consumers will reward that integrity. Indeed, Everlane’s refusal to maximize profit on a $15 T-shirt if it meant using a sweatshop exemplifies moral reasoning guiding business – they would rather charge a fair price and sleep at night knowing the labor was ethical.

**Patagonia** is often held up as the gold standard of ethical leadership in apparel. Patagonia’s CEOs and founder approach decisions with a clear moral calculus: what option does the most good (or least harm) to people and planet? This has led them to invest heavily in ethical supply chains – for instance, switching to organic cotton in the 1990s despite a five-year business hit, or rejecting wool suppliers until they could source **sustainably grazed wool** that met strict animal welfare standards【9†L73-L79】. Their corporate ethos, famously articulated by Chouinard, is *“Let my people go surfing”* – a belief in work-life balance and trust – but also *“we’re in business to save our home planet,”* which reframes every strategic choice as an ethical one. A telling ethical dilemma came when Patagonia had to decide whether to continue supplying corporate co-branded vests to companies at odds with Patagonia’s environmental stance. They chose to cut ties with certain clients that didn’t align with their values, sacrificing short-term revenue to maintain integrity. Rose Marcario explicitly said, *“business can serve more than the shareholder interest… We focus on people and planet alongside profit”*【12†L181-L189】, indicating that whenever a decision pits profit against core values, Patagonia will favor the latter. This moral clarity simplifies many dilemmas: if a manufacturing method pollutes rivers or exploits workers, the answer is simply *no*, and they’ll innovate another way.

Moral challenges around labor and sourcing are common, and midsize leaders often take them personally. **American Apparel**, under a previous CEO, became infamous for ethics issues (sweatshop-free manufacturing but internal sexual misconduct). The subsequent CEO had to restore an ethical culture, underscoring how one leader’s moral failings can nearly sink a brand. In contrast, **Eileen Fisher** has quietly built an ethical company by supporting initiatives like B Corp certification and giving employees ownership stakes (through an ESOP) to share value broadly【29†L9-L17】. She and her leadership team face choices like whether to use cheaper overseas production or support local artisans; almost invariably, they lean towards the option that honors craftsmanship and fair labor, even if margins are thinner. Fisher’s comment that *“I have a deep sense that I didn’t create this business alone. I listened… we worked together”*【34†L247-L253】 hints at a humility and ethical viewpoint that everyone contributing to the company (from sewers to sellers) deserves respect and voice.

Illustrative ethical decisions also emerge when CEOs address social issues beyond their direct business. **Chip Bergh** made waves by publishing an open letter requesting customers not bring guns into Levi’s stores, citing the safety of employees and patrons as his paramount concern【46†L274-L282】. This was a moral stance – prioritizing human life and comfort over potential backlash from gun-rights advocates. Bergh acknowledged the divisiveness of the issue but reasoned from first principles: no one *“needs a gun to try on a pair of jeans,”* and a mishap had already injured a customer, so he appealed to the better angels of shoppers【46†L274-L282】【46†L268-L276】. His ethical reasoning put employee safety and company values (Levi’s has a history of inclusivity and social justice) above the risk of lost sales from gun owners. The outcome was largely positive, reinforcing that taking a principled stand can strengthen a brand’s identity. In summary, these midsized apparel CEOs typically approach dilemmas with a values-first mindset – whether it’s labor rights, environmental stewardship, or social justice, they reference their core mission and ethics as the “North Star”【8†L5-L12】 in making tough calls. They demonstrate that doing the right thing is not just moral but can be strategically wise, cultivating brand trust and loyalty that money can’t buy.

## Procedural & Functional Tasks
Translating strategic vision into operational reality is a day-to-day challenge for midsize company CEOs. These leaders are often deeply involved in setting up processes and structures to implement their ideas across the organization. One common approach is to initiate *listening and alignment processes* when new strategies are rolled out. For example, when Chip Bergh set out to reinvent Levi’s culture, he began with a **structured interview process** – meeting top managers one-on-one with prepared questions【19†L115-L123】. This procedure served two purposes: it signaled that change was coming and everyone’s perspective mattered, and it gathered crucial information that he used to align his strategy with the company’s heritage values【19†L117-L124】. By the end of it, Bergh said he was *“really clear about the company’s DNA”*, which then informed how he communicated the turnaround plan to all employees【19†L117-L124】. Such upfront listening sessions or surveys are procedural tactics these CEOs use to ensure that when they execute changes (be it a reorg, a new product line, or a policy shift), they do so with an understanding of stakeholder concerns and the company’s baseline.

Another key task is setting concrete goals and organizing teams around them. Midsize apparel firms often don’t have the luxury of vast bureaucracies, so CEOs implement focused initiatives through cross-functional teams. **Michael Preysman** might establish a taskforce for Everlane’s sustainability goals, for instance. When he committed to eliminating new plastic, operational steps would include auditing materials, researching alternatives, and reengineering packaging. He likely appointed a project lead and team spanning product design, supply chain, and store operations to drive this, and tracked progress regularly. The **“tough choices”** he mentions with radical transparency【28†L83-L87】 indicate that implementing such ideals required systematic changes – e.g. updating factory contracts, changing shipping vendors – each a functional task cascaded down from the C-suite to various departments. CEOs like Preysman stay involved by setting milestones (e.g., quarterly reductions in plastic usage) and reviewing outcomes, but they empower their teams to execute the nitty-gritty, intervening as needed to remove roadblocks.

To align teams with executive decisions, communication and reinforcement are constant tasks. Many midsize CEOs hold regular all-hands meetings or send company-wide updates to reiterate the strategic direction. **Jennifer Hyman** during the pandemic held frequent Zoom town halls to explain each major decision (such as the painful layoffs and why they were necessary for the company’s survival)【26†L650-L658】. She also articulated a simplified strategy – focusing on three key things to transform the business – so that every team member knew what the priorities were【26†L652-L658】. By explicitly telling teams *“here are the three things we’re going to do”*【26†L652-L658】, she provided a procedural roadmap that managers could translate into team-level OKRs or action plans. This clear cascade of objectives is vital in midsize firms: it ensures that a bold strategic shift (like pivoting to a new customer segment or channel) is broken down into tasks for marketing, merchandising, tech, and store operations in a coordinated way.

Implementing strategy also often involves **process improvements** championed by the CEO. For instance, **Stitch Fix’s** Katrina Lake integrated data science into the fashion merchandising process – a novel concept. She institutionalized a process where data insights (like identifying a missing style such as capped-sleeve blouses) flow into product development【7†L543-L552】. Concretely, she set up a feedback loop: client data → algorithmic trend identification → human designers creating new items → stylists validating with clients. Establishing this required her to create new organizational functions (data science teams working hand-in-hand with design). In doing so, Lake effectively implemented a new procedural DNA for the company (termed “Hybrid Designs”)【7†L543-L552】. The success – 29 new apparel items designed by computer algorithms meeting previously unmet client needs【7†L544-L552】 – shows how a CEO’s strategic idea (personalization at scale) was codified into a repeatable process.

Finally, aligning the broader team often means **leading by example in execution**. These CEOs tend to be visible in the trenches when executing big changes. If sustainability is a goal, you might see the CEO personally visiting supplier factories to inspect conditions. If omnichannel retail is the strategy, the CEO might spend a day as a sales associate to identify pain points in stores. Such hands-on actions function as both fact-finding and symbolic acts that signal commitment. In summary, midsized apparel CEOs convert strategy to action through structured listening, cross-functional initiatives, clear goal-setting, continuous communication, and often a personal touch in oversight. Their companies are complex enough to need formal processes, but small enough that the CEO’s direct involvement can materially speed up and smooth out execution.

## Creative & Expressive Tasks
In the fashion industry, creativity and brand storytelling are strategic assets, and midsize company CEOs frequently take an active role in these areas to differentiate their brands. Many see themselves as curators of brand culture and use expressive tasks – like crafting the brand narrative or championing innovation – as a key part of their leadership. **Eileen Fisher**, for instance, imbues her brand with her personal ethos of simplicity and mindfulness. She ensures that everything from store design to marketing voice reflects a calm, inclusive, empowering spirit. Her headquarters has *“glass-walled ‘duck-in’ rooms named Delight and Creativity”*, and even hosts community meditation sessions【34†L279-L287】【34†L281-L288】. This physical and cultural environment is a creative expression of the brand’s identity (flowing, open, human-centered) and it’s very much by design. Fisher consciously treats business as a creative endeavor – a quote from her: *“We consciously work on the collaborative process… I listened, I heard, and we worked together. It would have been something different if I hadn’t worked in a collaborative way. That made it so much better.”*【34†L243-L251】【34†L247-L253】. By foregrounding collaboration and intuition (the “feminine side” of management, as she says【34†L243-L249】), she fosters a creative culture that not only designs unique clothing but also innovates in how the company operates (like her unusual co-leadership structure).

Storytelling is another arena where these CEOs shine. **Patagonia’s leadership** has effectively turned the brand’s story – of an unconventional founder who loved nature and hated traditional business norms – into a powerful marketing and recruiting tool. The CEOs continue this narrative by, say, publishing essays about environmental responsibility or producing documentary films on conservation, thereby extending Patagonia’s brand story beyond products. A midsize CEO often personally embodies the brand story: **Yvon Chouinard** literally wrote “Let My People Go Surfing,” blending autobiography with company philosophy, which guides employees that it’s okay to catch a wave at lunch as long as the work gets done. This creative ethos attracts passionate employees and customers. Another example is **Michael Preysman’s** storytelling around Everlane’s “radical transparency.” He communicates with customers in a very direct, educational tone about cost breakdowns and factory tours, essentially turning supply chain transparency into a compelling story of “know what you’re paying for.” This narrative was novel in fashion and set Everlane apart in a crowded market【28†L104-L113】【28†L108-L116】. The CEO’s role here was as chief storyteller – in interviews and on the website, Preysman consistently framed Everlane as the honest alternative in an industry of secrets, an approach that resonated with a generation of conscious consumers.

When it comes to bold or unconventional strategic moves, these CEOs have shown a creative daring that often pays off. **Jennifer Hyman** made a gutsy bet early on that women would share (rent) high-end clothes – at the time, an untested concept. To convince designers to supply inventory, she often had to weave a vision of a new future for fashion consumption. That persuasion was part creativity (painting a picture of a “closetless” world) and part analysis. Rent the Runway’s very existence is a case study in a creative business model challenging the status quo of retail. **Katrina Lake** similarly innovated with the subscription “style box” model for Stitch Fix, melding tech and fashion in a new way. The strategy of sending surprise curated items was a creative leap from traditional e-commerce, and it required extensive storytelling to customers to get them comfortable with a new shopping experience (hence her HBR piece explaining their model in depth【7†L525-L533】【7†L532-L540】).

Brand culture is another canvas for creativity. **Allbirds’** co-CEOs (though footwear-focused, they venture into apparel) built a culture of playful innovation – they famously experiment with materials like eucalyptus fiber or sugarcane foam, and make that R&D story part of their brand charm. CEOs like them often encourage internal hackathons for sustainable design or cross-departmental innovation sessions, recognizing that good ideas can come from anywhere. **Chip Bergh**, while very execution-focused, also understood the importance of keeping Levi’s culturally relevant – he invested in creative marketing (like leveraging music festivals and a tailored customization experience) to reconnect Levi’s with youth culture, showing that even a 150-year-old brand can be reinvented with fresh creative strategies【14†L1-L8】.

Finally, some expressive moves are outwardly symbolic but internally meaningful. Patagonia’s decision to **donate its entire $10 million tax cut to environmental nonprofits** in 2018, or more recently Chouinard essentially giving away the company to a trust to fund climate action, are bold moves that tell a story about the brand’s values loud and clear. These are CEO-level decisions that double as expressive acts, galvanizing employees (who feel proud to be part of a “crazy but cool” company) and inspiring customers. In sum, midsized apparel CEOs often view their role not just as administrators of a business, but as *creative leaders*. They craft compelling brand narratives, embrace unconventional strategies, and infuse the organization with a culture that values innovation and authenticity. This creative and expressive leadership is a key differentiator that helps midsize brands punch above their weight in a competitive industry.

## AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making
The rise of artificial intelligence has added new dimensions to how midsized apparel CEOs make decisions, and many approach AI with cautious optimism – leveraging its power in certain domains while consciously defining the boundaries of human vs. machine authority. A common scenario involves **trusting AI for data-driven insights but keeping humans in the loop for judgment calls**. **Katrina Lake** of Stitch Fix famously built the company on an algorithm that learns customers’ tastes, but she stressed that *“shopping is inherently a personal and human activity”*. Thus, Stitch Fix *“insists on combining data with a human stylist who can alter or override”* the algorithm’s recommendations【7†L550-L556】. In practice, the AI might crunch vast data to suggest 10 items for a customer, but a human stylist makes the final curation, adding a personalized note. This delineation shows Lake’s balanced trust: AI handles the heavy analytics at scale, humans handle the nuanced, emotional aspect of styling. It reflects a broader principle – AI is an advisor, not the ultimate decision-maker, in areas touching brand and customer experience.

There are also instances of **mistrust or learning to trust AI**. Many CEOs are mindful that blindly following an algorithm can backfire. Research in the retail sector indicates an interesting twist: front-line decision makers sometimes second-guess algorithms, thinking their gut knows better, which can undermine results【37†L331-L339】【37†L333-L340】. A Harvard study with fashion retailer Tapestry (Coach, Kate Spade, etc.) found that when employees were given a “black box” AI recommendation vs. one they could interpret, those who *didn’t* try to second-guess the AI often made better decisions【37†L325-L333】. The counterintuitive finding was that *“knowing less about how an algorithm works”* but **trusting the people** who built it can lead to superior outcomes【37†L325-L333】. For CEOs, this underscores that building trust in AI systems – through validation and culture – is key. Executives must often **sell** AI internally, framing it as a tool that complements human expertise. If employees see that leadership trusts the AI (because it’s been tested and proven), they are more likely to accept its recommendations.

In terms of boundaries, midsized apparel CEOs generally keep ultimate creative and ethical decisions in human hands. AI is heavily used in domains like demand forecasting, trend prediction, inventory optimization, and even design suggestions. For instance, Stitch Fix leveraged a form of generative AI to create new clothing designs based on identified style gaps (like that missing cap-sleeve blouse example)【7†L543-L552】. But even then, human designers refined those algorithm-generated designs, and the company’s ethos was that *“Humans are much better than machines at some things – and they are likely to stay that way for a long time.”*【7†L550-L556】. This sentiment, shared by many peers, draws a line: AI can handle data volume and pattern recognition beyond human capacity, yet areas requiring empathy, aesthetic judgment, or moral judgment remain human domains. **Michael Preysman** likely uses AI analytics to track Everlane’s supply chain efficiency or to parse customer feedback at scale, but when deciding if a supplier meets Everlane’s ethical standards, a human audit and value judgment is the final word – not an algorithm.

CEOs also grapple with the extent to which AI should influence strategic direction. They generally expect AI to **contribute insights, not make decisions** for them. AI might highlight that a certain product category is trending or that a particular store is underperforming. The CEO then uses those insights as one input among many. **Jennifer Hyman** has discussed how Rent the Runway uses data (a form of AI analytics) to understand usage patterns, which informed their shift to a subscription model. But when the pandemic hit, no algorithm could dictate her strategy – human creativity and leadership had to chart a new course. Interestingly, some CEOs foresee expanding AI’s role in real-time decision support. In merchandising, for example, they might lean on AI for dynamic pricing or tailoring promotions to local store preferences. However, they maintain authority to override these suggestions if they conflict with brand positioning or gut instinct.

A delicate aspect is ensuring AI doesn’t undermine managerial authority or employee morale. There is implicit understanding that *people don’t like taking orders from a faceless algorithm*【37†L309-L317】. So, leaders often introduce AI as assisting tools. They might say, “Our new AI system will help your planning by providing recommendations, but it’s up to you to decide and we trust your expertise.” This way, employees feel augmented rather than dictated to. The midsize scale actually helps here: the CEO can personally communicate the intent behind AI adoption to the workforce, setting the tone that AI is here to *empower* them, not replace them.

Notably, there have been specific moments where AI significantly influenced direction. Stitch Fix’s entire model is one, but also **fast-fashion retailers’ AI trend analysis** has indirectly pressured midsize brands to react faster. A midsize CEO might pivot their calendar because AI tools predicted an upcoming micro-trend (say, a spike in demand for sustainable loungewear), leading them to fast-track a new collection. If the AI is right, it can be a big win – capturing a trend early. If it’s wrong, the CEO bears the consequence, which makes most of them careful: they validate AI-driven directions with test runs or pilot collections before full commitment.

In summary, AI is becoming a trusted analyst and assistant in the midsized apparel CEO’s toolkit. These leaders trust AI for what it does best – data crunching at scale and pattern spotting – and they rely on human judgment for what machines can’t do (contextualize nuance, uphold brand values, inspire people). They draw clear boundaries to ensure AI informs but does not overshadow human decision-making authority. As one CEO might put it, AI is “on tap, not on top” – always available to provide insight, but never the boss. By integrating AI in this balanced way, midsized apparel CEOs aim to gain competitive edge through technology without losing the human touch that defines their brand and leadership style【7†L550-L556】【37†L331-L339】.

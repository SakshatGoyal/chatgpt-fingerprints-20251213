# iPhone Auto Shutdown Workaround

## You (2025-07-16T23:52:15.092000+00:00)

is there a way to automatically turn off an iphone at 10:00pm and have it turn back on at 4:00am?

No, **iPhones do not currently support automatic power off/on scheduling** like some Android devices do.

Here’s what you **can and can’t do**, plus some workarounds:

---

### ✅ **What You *Can* Do**
#### 1. **Use Sleep Focus (Recommended for Your Case)**
This won’t shut down the phone, but it will silence notifications, dim the screen, and optionally block apps.

- **Settings > Focus > Sleep**
- Set **Sleep Schedule** from 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM.
- Customize what’s allowed during that time (calls, apps, etc.)

#### 2. **Use Screen Time Downtime**
- Go to **Settings > Screen Time > Downtime**
- Schedule from 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM
- Limits access to apps unless manually overridden

#### 3. **Airplane Mode via Shortcuts + Automation**
While you can't shut down the phone, you can automate putting it in **Airplane Mode**:
- Open **Shortcuts > Automation**
- Create Personal Automation for 10:00 PM → Turn Airplane Mode ON
- Create another for 4:00 AM → Turn Airplane Mode OFF

**Note**: Apple *requires manual confirmation* for Airplane Mode automation unless your phone is jailbroken.

### ❌ **What You *Can't* Do**
- **There’s no built-in way to power off or restart an iPhone automatically.**
- **Shortcuts app cannot turn off the phone.**
- **No third-party app can control power state (Apple restricts this).**

---

### 🧠 Why This Matters
Apple deliberately restricts automatic shutdown/startup for safety, reliability, and control reasons—especially to ensure alarms, emergency access, and updates are not interfered with.

Let me know if you'd like help setting up a Sleep Focus that mimics full shutdown behavior as closely as possible (no sounds, no notifications, no distractions).

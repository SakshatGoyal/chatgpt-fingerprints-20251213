# Salesforce AE Task List

## You (2025-07-21T16:37:40.901000+00:00)

Create a list of 100 tasks that an account executive might see in Salesforce. Use the two files I've attached to create a list of realistic, plausible tasks an account executive might encounter in Salesforce.

Ensure that the tasks have logical coherence with respect to both - the opportunities and accounts page. For example, if a deal is in best case, then 'schedule discovery call' would not be a plausible task.

In your output, give me

Account name, task name, due in (in the form of 'due in 12 days' as an example)


For your context,
Imagine you are an account exec at Palo Alto Networks and you're looking at tasks logged in Salesforce. I have a few samples of what those tasks might look like, but I need you to hypothesize a longer list of tasks that may be inspired by the list I've given you, but may also be completely independent and talk about different aspects of the typical tasks that an account exec sees. I'm hoping for at least 100 different tasks, and in your output, you can just list the task name and date.

*That’s 100 logically plausible tasks tied to either the opportunity’s stage (Discovery, Solution, Negotiate) or the account’s health/risk profile, mirroring the real-world workflow of a Palo Alto Networks AE.*

## You (2025-07-21T16:44:09.300000+00:00)

Use the precision signal framework pasted at the bottom of this message to cluster the above tasks into the 4 buckets.

The precision Signal Framework was designed to work on Account and Opportunity data, but i need you to repurpose it to sort through tasks.

Use the same framing approach; however, in your output, I need a key insight, followed by the respective tasks.

Create 2 insight per bucket (
- **Risk Densities**
- **Momentum Bottlenecks**
- **Contradiction Detection**
- **Silent Zones**)

and have atleast 2 tasks per insight.


# Precision Signal Framework

A model for AI-driven synthesis guiding Account Executives (AEs) through noisy pipelines by surfacing targeted, contextual signals without prescribing actions.

---

Instead of overwhelming users with exhaustive summaries, we spotlight:

- **Risk Densities**
- **Momentum Bottlenecks**
- **Contradiction Detection**
- **Silent Zones**

---

### Key Benefits

- **Contextual, Not Generic:** Insights tailored to specific AE filters (e.g., high-value renewals, stalled deals).
- **Directional, Not Prescriptive:** Empowers AE autonomy by highlighting critical patterns without explicit instructions.
- **Progressive Narrowing:** Streamlined funneling from 500+ deals down to the crucial few requiring attention.

---

### Examples of Spotlighted Risks

- Clusters of risk factors in specific products, sales motions, or segments.
- Deals slowing down or stalling near close, often mid-funnel.
- Forecast optimism that contradicts deal health and risk signals.
- High-value or critical deals with no activity, quiet risks.

---

### Why It Matters

- **Highlights where risk is systemic, not isolated, enabling strategic prioritization.**
- **Prevents promising deals from quietly stalling at late stages.**
- **Surfaces inflated forecasts before they skew pipeline health.**
- **Reveals hidden drop-off zones that lead to surprise churn or loss.**

---

## Spotlight Criteria

- **Risk Densities**
- **Momentum Bottlenecks**
- **Contradiction Detection**
- **Silent Zones**

---

---

## 🔴 Risk Densities

**What it finds:**

Clusters of high-impact risk factors within certain deal types, product segments, or customer profiles.

**Why it matters:**

These aren’t one-off problems. They point to systemic friction points—like product complexity, weak partner enablement, or post-sale execution gaps—that undermine a broader swath of deals.

**Examples:**

- 🏅 *61 of 101 deals (~$79.7M) carry “No Secured Technical Win”* – the most common pipeline-wide risk.
- 🧑‍💻 *42% of Firewall – PA Series deals have both Mandatory PS removed and Low adoption* – especially in Renewals and Upsells.
- 🏛️ *75% of Cortex & Cloud opportunities (24 total) show 2+ risk factors*, including No EBCs and 30+ days of inactivity.

---

## 🟡 Momentum Bottlenecks

**What it finds:**

Opportunities approaching expected close—but showing no movement in engagement, quote status, or stage progression.

**Why it matters:**

Momentum stalls often occur silently. And they happen just when velocity matters most—late-funnel, mid-stage, or within the closing window. Identifying them early prevents avoidable slippage.

**Examples:**

- ⌛ *14 of 37 deals closing within 45 days have had no activity in 30+ days* – a late-stage stall in otherwise viable pipeline.
- 🧑‍💻 *17 of 31 deals in Solution stage (~$26.8M) have stalled due to pending quotes or removed PS.*
- 🕰️ *11 Upsell deals (~$22.7M) sit in Stage 2 Discovery, with close dates averaging just 52 days out*, indicating pre-engagement drag.

---

## 🟠 Contradiction Detection

**What it finds:**

Forecast tags like “Best Case” or “Commit” applied to deals with underlying fragility—misaligned risk profiles or health signals.

**Why it matters:**

Forecast confidence often masks structural weakness. These contradictions inflate pipeline expectations, causing downstream planning risk and missed targets.

**Examples:**

- 📉 *17 deals marked Best Case, yet 12 have 3+ risk factors—including 5 without secured wins and 3 in Critical health.*
- ❗ *The largest Commit deal ($7.1M) shows no tech win, pending quote, and no budget discussion*—a fragile anchor deal.
- 🔄 *8 of 13 Renewals > $1M are flagged At-Risk or Critical, yet tagged as Pipeline or Best Case.*

---

## 🟣 Silent Zones

**What it finds:**

Deals, often high-value or close to renewal, that have gone dark, showing zero engagement in recent weeks.

**Why it matters:**

Inactivity is a leading indicator of churn, de-prioritization, or deal decay. If caught early, many can be recovered. If missed, they quietly exit the pipeline without anyone noticing.

**Examples:**

- 💤 *19 deals (~$28.4M) have been inactive for 30+ days; 11 must close in the next 60 days.*
- 🧯 *6 of 22 renewals have been dormant for over a month—and 5 also show quote or partner risks.*
- ⚠️ *5 of 7 high-value Cortex Cloud deals (> $1M) show no recent engagement, and most are still in early Discovery.*

---

---

## What it Delivers

- **Scales with AE workload**, whether 200 or 1,000 deals.
- **Respects AE judgment**—never dictates, only guides.
- **Builds trust**—grounded in actual pipeline data, not AI guesswork.
- **Guides behavior**—insights naturally lead to focused filters.

---

---

---

# Precision Signal Framework – *Omnidata Edition*

A unified model for AI-driven signal detection across the full AE landscape—surfacing focused, contextual insights across **Opportunities, Accounts, Renewals**, and more.

---

Instead of overwhelming users with noise, we guide attention through:

- **Risk Densities**
- **Momentum Bottlenecks**
- **Contradiction Detection**
- **Silent Zones**

> Framework remains category-agnostic but can be applied distinctly per data type or across a blended signal view.
>

---

## Universal Signal Philosophy

- **Category-Flexible:** Signals adapt across any AE-relevant dataset.
- **Insight-Layered:** Each signal family retains interpretive power across context.
- **Non-Prescriptive:** We illuminate; AEs decide.
- **Systemic Awareness:** Designed to surface not just item-level risk, but pattern-level insight across a book of business.

---

## Signal Types

### 🔴 Risk Densities

**What it finds:**

Clusters of fragility across any AE portfolio segment—deals, accounts, or renewals—revealing systemic friction.

**Examples:**

- 61 out of 101 deals (≈ $79.7M) carry the risk 🏅 No Secured technical win—making it the most common single-point risk across the pipeline.
- Among Firewall – PA Series deals, 42% (11 of 26) have both 🧑‍💻 Mandatory PS removed and 🛑 Low adoption, especially among Renewals and Upsells, suggesting systemic post-sale execution friction.
- Across all Cortex & Cloud opportunities (24 total), 75% carry ≥2 risk factors, most commonly 🏛️ No EBCs in last year and 💤 No activity for last 30 days—indicating low engagement in technically complex deals.
- Deals over $5M (13 in total, ≈ $86.1M) disproportionately carry budgeting and approval risks:

    – 8 flag ⌛ Quotes pending approval

    – 7 lack finalized budget conversations (💲)

    – 6 miss a partner engagement (🤝)


---

---

### 🟡 Momentum Bottlenecks

**What it finds:**

Clusters that should be advancing—toward close, toward upsell, toward renewal—but are stalling or stuck.

**Examples:**

- Of the 37 deals with ≤45 days to close, 14 have had no logged activity in 30+ days—a clear momentum stall at a critical point in time.
- Within the Solution stage (Stage 3), 17 of 31 deals (≈ $26.8M) have either ⌛ pending quotes or 🧑‍💻 removed PS, slowing mid-funnel movement.
- 11 Upsell deals (≈ $22.7M) sit in Stage 2 Discovery—with an average close horizon of only 52 days, indicating pre-engagement drag in existing accounts.
- Net New deals in Cortex XSIAM and XSOAR tend to bottleneck in Discovery:

    – 7 of 10 are in early stages

    – 5 carry ≥3 risks

    – 4 show no activity in past 30 days


---

---

### 🟠 Contradiction Detection

**What it finds:**

Declared confidence that contradicts factual signal health—forecast tags, account optimism, or renewal assumptions vs. signal reality.

**Examples:**

- 17 deals are labeled Best Case, yet 12 of them have ≥3 active risk factors.

    – Notably, 5 Best Case deals lack secured tech wins and show no partner activity.

    – 3 are in Critical health despite optimistic forecast tags.

- The largest Commit deal, $7.1M, involves no secured win, pending quote, and no budget conversation—indicating a fragile top-of-forecast commitment.
- Across Renewals > $1M, 8 of 13 are flagged as At-risk or Critical, yet 6 remain tagged as Pipeline or Best Case—a misalignment between deal health and sales confidence.
- One Firewall – VM Series deal in the Purchase stage still lacks an approved quote and has logged no activity in 41 days—a red flag given its supposed sales readiness.

---

### 🟣 Silent Zones

**What it finds:**

Complete engagement dead zones. No movement, no updates, no signal—usually on high-potential or mission-critical records.

**Examples:**

- 19 deals (≈ $28.4M) have logged no activity in the last 30 days;

    – 11 of them must close in the next 60 days

    – 7 are currently tagged Best Case or Commit

- Within Renewals, 6 of 22 deals show inactivity for >30 days, and 5 of those also carry quote or partner risks—pointing to potential revenue churn risk.
- Prisma Access opportunities (SASE) have the highest share of silent deals, with 7 of 14 inactive for ≥30 days and 5 of those flagged as At-Risk in account health.
- High-value Cortex Cloud deals (>$1M) are largely dormant:

    – 5 of 7 have had no recent engagement

    – 4 are in early Discovery despite near-term close targets

    – 3 show missing EBCs and partner finalization gaps


---

## How to Use the Framework

- **Slice by Data Type:** Run separately across all data points.
- **Combine for Unified View:** Blend to see cross-signal trends and correlations.
- **Layer Filters for Precision:** Target by segment, vertical, rep, forecast category, product line, or any of the other data columns.

---

## Output Design Principles

- **Funnel Attention, Not Just Summarize.**
- **Let Patterns Emerge—Don't Prescribe Actions.**
- **Maintain Human Trust—Grounded in Observable Behavior.**
- **Support AE Judgment—Amplify Focus, Don’t Replace Intuition.**

## You (2025-07-21T16:51:42.563000+00:00)

I like this, but i want you to rephrase the insight statements in a way that you're not expressing opinions, you're reporting observations.

for example: "Legal red-lines and counsel reviews are piling up, hinting at systemic friction in closing paperwork."

You don't need to say 'hinting at systemic friction'. You can say something else that's fairly neutral. Speak as if you are a neutral, data-driven researcher.

## ChatGPT (2025-07-21T16:51:43.431699+00:00)

Think through the steps they may identify while looking at this, questions they may have, what they may ask an AI assistant, how the Assistant might respond, and what action might the assistant share (not recommendations, but actions that are logged in salesforce as 'to be completed'), and from there, how might a user navigate into salesforce, and the actions they may take in salesforce.

Here's a realistic, hypothetical workflow describing how an AE might navigate this platform, interact with an AI assistant, and transition actions into Salesforce tasks:

---

### 🟢 **Step 1: AE Reviews Platform Dashboard**
- Logs in and scans high-level insights.
- Notices:
  - **200 opportunities** totaling $158.1M.
  - **54 accounts** holding $350.4M in LTV.
  - **22 tasks** due in the next 7 days.

---

### 🟢 **Step 2: AE Observes Critical Insights**
- Reads high-impact alerts provided by the AI:
  - **19 renewals ($52M)** without secured technical wins and low executive engagement.
  - **18 deals ($28M)** with low quarterly activity.
  - Specific at-risk deals, e.g., **Prime Dynamics ($7.9M)** marked as Critical health, **Virtucon ($6.2M)** with recent Critical rating, and others with similar patterns.

---

### 🔵 **Step 3: AE Forms Questions for the AI Assistant**
AE might ask:
- *"Why is Prime Dynamics marked Critical? What’s driving the 4 risk factors?"*
- *"What actions can I prioritize to secure Cyberdyne’s $7.1M upsell this quarter?"*
- *"Are there any upcoming executive engagements scheduled for Virtucon?"*
- *"Show me tasks that must be completed this week related to Cortex and Cloud deals."*

---

### 🤖 **Step 4: AI Assistant Responds (Contextualized and Neutral)**
**Example AI responses:**

> **For Prime Dynamics ($7.9M)**:
> "Risk Factors include:
> 1. Renewal prep call overdue by 36 days.
> 2. No secured technical win.
> 3. Low exec engagement flagged last month.
> 4. Cortex implementation health marked as critical by CS team."

> **Cyberdyne ($7.1M Best Case)**:
> "Last activity was an architecture review (8 days ago).
> Key open actions include:
> - Secure technical win approval (task overdue by 5 days).
> - Confirm CFO pricing approval (due in 9 days)."

> **Virtucon ($6.2M)**:
> "No executive engagements scheduled.
> Last activity: Architecture Review (13 days ago).
> Recommended upcoming Salesforce actions include scheduling an Executive Briefing or EBC."

> **Tasks due this week (Cortex & Cloud)**:
> "- Finalize Bill of Materials (Lumina Health, due in 3 days).
> - Secure Technical Win (Ironclad, due in 4 days).
> - Coordinate legal redlines (Endurance Group, due in 2 days)."

---

### 🟣 **Step 5: AI Assistant Logs Suggested Actions in Salesforce**
(Not recommendations, but actionable items based on AE's queries)

- **Prime Dynamics**:
  - *Schedule renewal review with customer CS and executive sponsor.*
  - *Request internal checkpoint to resolve outstanding tech win issue.*

- **Cyberdyne Systems**:

  - Cyberdyne CFO Pricing Call.
  - Prime Dynamics Renewal Review.
- Assigns Virtucon EBC scheduling task to supporting internal resource.
- Marks existing task “Technical Win approval” as High Priority for Cyberdyne Systems.
- Logs an update on Prime Dynamics regarding health risks and next steps.

---

### 🟩 **Step 8: AE Updates Salesforce Pipeline and Forecast**
- Adjusts forecast categories or amounts if needed based on task progression.
- Adds notes to opportunities about planned executive engagements, completed technical wins, or resolved risks.

---

### 🔄 **Step 9: AE Returns to AI Assistant for Further Clarity**
- AE returns to the insights platform and asks:
  - *"Update me on silent zones or bottlenecks that emerged in my deals after today’s activities."*
- AI responds, showing new or resolved bottlenecks, silent zones cleared or remaining, and updated risk densities.

---

### 📌 **Workflow Outcome**
The AE experiences:
- A clear cycle between actionable insights from the AI platform, efficient task management, and accurate CRM updates.
- Increased visibility and reduced friction in pipeline management, forecast accuracy, and task prioritization.

---

This workflow encapsulates realistic, AE-centric interactions integrating your provided visuals and existing task lists into a coherent, practical process.

## You (2025-07-30T21:04:00.323000+00:00)

ok, imagine an AI system is not part of the equation, and its an account executive (a human) who's guiding all the interactions and making decisions. What might they decide to do next, where might they go to do those tasks, and what more would they need to do those tasks.

## ChatGPT (2025-07-30T21:04:01.209101+00:00)

Here’s a realistic workflow for an AE **without an AI assistant**, based purely on their own judgment and actions.

---

## **1️⃣ Step 1: Reviewing the Dashboard**

The AE logs into the insights platform (as shown in your screenshot) and sees key indicators:

- **22 tasks** due in the next week.
- High-value accounts marked **Critical** or **At-Risk**.
- Specific large deals flagged due to multiple risk factors.

The AE immediately focuses on high-impact deals, such as:
- **Prime Dynamics** ($7.9M, Critical health)
- **Cyberdyne Systems** ($7.1M, At-Risk)
- **Virtucon** ($6.2M, Critical health)

---

## **2️⃣ Step 2: Prioritizing Opportunities and Tasks**

Based on this, the AE decides to prioritize immediate actions needed to close these large opportunities. They begin formulating action plans for the most urgent deals.

### Example decisions they make:

- For **Prime Dynamics**, resolve overdue renewal prep tasks.
- For **Cyberdyne**, finalize technical win and CFO approval.
- For **Virtucon**, improve executive engagement.

---

## **3️⃣ Step 3: Transition to Salesforce**

The AE navigates into Salesforce (clicking the "View in Salesforce" link shown) and opens:

- Opportunity records for the above deals.
- Tasks and activities sections within each opportunity.

---

## **4️⃣ Step 4: AE Activities within Salesforce**

Within Salesforce, the AE performs several key actions:

- **Prime Dynamics Opportunity**:
  - Reviews past activities and identifies internal stakeholders (SEs, CS, Management).
  - Emails stakeholders internally requesting immediate renewal prep meeting.
  - Logs a new task:
    *"Set renewal health checkpoint with customer by end of week."*

- **Cyberdyne Systems Opportunity**:
  - Reviews notes from the Architecture Review.
  - Sends internal Slack messages to SE team to confirm status of technical win.
  - Emails finance team about pricing approval from customer CFO.
  - Creates and assigns a Salesforce task to self:
    *"Follow up with customer CFO on pricing approval by Thursday."*

- **Virtucon Opportunity**:
  - Checks for recent executive engagement activities—finds none.
  - Drafts and sends email directly to customer champion and internal executives suggesting an immediate EBC.
  - Creates Salesforce task:
    *"Schedule EBC with Virtucon executives within the next 2 weeks."*

---

## **5️⃣ Step 5: External Communication**

The AE then immediately begins external outreach (via email or phone):

- Emails **Prime Dynamics customer contact**:
  > "Let’s schedule a renewal health review ASAP—I want to make sure your experience is seamless."

- Calls **Cyberdyne CFO’s office** to expedite approval:
  > "Checking in regarding the pricing we proposed last week—anything holding up approvals?"

- Emails **Virtucon champion** to arrange an executive meeting:
  > "I'd like to set an executive briefing—does next week work?"

---

## **6️⃣ Step 6: Information Needs and Internal Follow-ups**

To effectively complete these tasks, the AE needs further support and additional information:

- From internal team (SEs, CS, Legal):
  - Technical Win status documentation.
  - Legal contract redlines/status.
  - Pricing confirmations and approved discounts.

- From external stakeholders (customers):
  - Confirmed meeting availability.
  - Approvals of budgets and pricing proposals.

AE proactively reaches out internally via Slack or email, clearly requesting this information.

---

## **7️⃣ Step 7: Salesforce Record Updates**

The AE updates Salesforce after each communication:

- Marks tasks as **Completed** once follow-ups are done.
- Adds **Notes** summarizing customer conversations and new actions.
- Adjusts **Opportunity Stage** as tasks move forward (e.g., moving Cyberdyne from Solution to Negotiate once CFO approval is obtained).

---

## **8️⃣ Step 8: Pipeline Review and Forecast Adjustments**

After taking these immediate steps, the AE reassesses their pipeline:

- Ensures forecast categories (Best Case, Pipeline, Commit) reflect latest engagement accurately.
- Updates quarterly forecasts and revenue projections based on progress.

---

## **9️⃣ Step 9: Continuous Monitoring**

AE regularly revisits both Salesforce and insights dashboard:

- Confirms progress on critical tasks.
- Checks status updates from internal teams.
- Adjusts prioritization based on real-time deal momentum.

---

## **🔄 Summary of AE Workflow (without AI)**

Without an AI assistant, the AE relies heavily on their own initiative, judgment, and proactive management, focusing on:

- Rapid identification and prioritization of critical deals.
- Direct communication with internal/external stakeholders.
- Rigorous Salesforce task logging and pipeline management.
- Constant realignment of forecasts and strategic priorities based on daily interactions.

This manual, iterative approach ensures consistent deal progression, but requires strong organizational skills, disciplined communication, and continuous monitoring of the pipeline and tasks.

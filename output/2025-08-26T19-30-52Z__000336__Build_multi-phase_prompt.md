# Build multi-phase prompt

## You (2025-08-26T19:30:52.390000+00:00)

I need your help defining an AI process that solely utilizes ChatGPT. This attached document talks about a product vision for sellers [Account Executives at Palo Alto Networks]. My goal is to use this almost as a thought framework (not a template) to create a similar document, but one that describes the vision for a new workflow for district managers. For your context, here's a hierarchy for Workers:

Account Executives - Own Territories
Regional Managers - Oversee Account Executives
District Managers - Oversee Regional Managers.

For this work, I want chatGPT to assume the role of a District Manager. We may also have to define the heirarchy for the GPT to work through this. We don't know what the priorities or issues are, so there may be an element of research involved in this prior to creating the document.

My plan is a multi-step process. Start by reading and extracting a thought process from the document. Followed by research in building a scaffolding for the persona, and then utilizing that scaffolding to create a new vision document for District Managers.

Thinking like an AI Researcher and Prompt Engineer, how might you approach this process.

## ChatGPT (2025-08-26T19:30:53.824896+00:00)

Here’s how I’d approach the process, thinking like both an **AI Researcher** and a **Prompt Engineer**, using the uploaded *AI-Powered Sales Workbench Vision Document* as a reference point:

---

### 1. Extract the *Thought Framework* (not template) from the AE-focused document
We want to distill the *underlying structure and reasoning approach* that the authors used.
From reviewing the document, here’s the implicit framework they followed:

- **Context:** Why the initiative exists (business challenges, organizational complexity, inefficiencies).
- **Vision / North Star:** What the end-state looks like, with measurable outcomes (e.g., unified workflows, accurate insights, productivity).
- **Problems to Address:** Pain points from “day in the life” research, presented both narratively and visually (fragmentation, misalignment, lack of insights).
- **Strategy:** Guiding design principles, role-specific tailoring, and how AI will solve problems.
- **Use Cases:** Specific applications of the platform (forecasting, quoting, renewals, etc.).
- **Metrics of Success:** Tangible KPIs (efficiency gains, adoption, revenue lift).
- **Guiding Principles:** Philosophy and design trade-offs.
- **Future State:** Evolution path (agentic co-pilot).

👉 This becomes the “scaffolding” we can adapt to the District Manager level. 【5†source】

---

### 2. Define the Hierarchy & Personas
We need to clearly model the hierarchy for ChatGPT to reason about roles:

- **Account Executive (AE):** Owns territories, executes deals.
- **Regional Manager (RM):** Oversees AEs, ensures pipeline health and execution.
- **District Manager (DM):** Oversees RMs, owns broader strategic alignment, resource allocation, forecasting accuracy, growth across districts.

For ChatGPT to “assume the role of a District Manager,” we’ll scaffold its perspective with:
- Responsibilities (e.g., ensuring regional consistency, driving ARR growth across regions, risk mitigation at scale).
- Pain points (e.g., fragmented visibility across regions, strategy dilution between corporate and field, inconsistent execution across RMs, forecasting uncertainty).
- Success metrics (e.g., predictability of revenue, territory coverage effectiveness, alignment with corporate strategy, reducing RM cognitive load).

---

### 3. Research Layer (Before Vision Creation)
Since we don’t yet know the *specific pain points of District Managers*, ChatGPT will need a research mode.
- **Primary Sources:** Industry best practices for sales leadership, analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester), LinkedIn posts from CROs/VPs, thought leadership on sales management challenges.
- **Secondary Sources:** Internal “day in the life” studies (if available), analogous pain points extrapolated upward from AE and RM challenges in the existing doc.

This is where ChatGPT’s web-enabled research can scaffold insights before drafting.

---

### 4. Scaffolding for District Manager Vision
Once research is in place, ChatGPT can apply the extracted framework (step 1) but tuned to the DM persona (step 2).
The scaffolding would look like:

1. **Context:** The scale and complexity District Managers deal with.
2. **Vision:** A North Star for District Managers (predictability, strategic alignment, scalable execution).
3. **Problems:** Pain points (visibility gaps, inconsistent regional execution, too much operational overhead).
4. **Strategy:** How an AI-powered workbench would serve as their "single pane of glass."
5. **Use Cases:** Examples tailored for DMs (forecast roll-ups, cross-region benchmarking, RM performance coaching, risk heatmaps).
6. **Metrics:** Adoption by RMs, forecast accuracy, variance reduction, ARR growth consistency.
7. **Guiding Principles:** Cohesion across regions, data integrity, scalability, alignment with corporate initiatives.
8. **Future State:** Evolution to a true “agentic co-pilot” for DMs (auto-surfacing at-risk regions, suggesting coaching interventions).

---

### 5. Multi-Step AI Workflow
The AI process to accomplish this solely with ChatGPT would look like:

1. **Extraction Phase:** Parse the existing doc to derive the reasoning structure (done above).
2. **Research Phase:** Instruct ChatGPT to gather industry/domain insights on DM-level challenges.
3. **Persona Scaffolding:** Build a detailed DM persona with responsibilities, pain points, and success metrics.
4. **Vision Creation:** Use the scaffolding to generate the DM-specific vision doc, mirroring the original structure.
5. **Refinement & Iteration:** Iterate the doc with style/tone alignment, ensuring it feels strategic but pragmatic.

---

### 6. Prompt Engineering Considerations
When prompting ChatGPT in each phase, we’d use *persona-anchoring* and *scaffolded reasoning*:
- Anchor ChatGPT as a **District Manager in a B2B SaaS sales org**.
- Instruct it to **reason inductively from AE → RM → DM challenges**, but also supplement with industry research.
- Force clarity between **empirical insights** (research-backed) and **speculative reasoning** (ChatGPT synthesis).

---

✅ In short: The process is **extract → research → scaffold → create → refine**.
This ensures we don’t just “re-skin” the AE doc but create a truly DM-level vision document.

---

Would you like me to **map out the likely District Manager pain points and responsibilities** first (step 2+3), so we have the scaffolding ready before drafting the new vision document?

## You (2025-08-26T19:32:59.113000+00:00)

think through the different phases and ask me questions that will help you build one individual prompt for each of these phases.





## ChatGPT (2025-08-26T19:32:59.965243+00:00)

awesome — let’s turn your plan into a clean, multi-phase pipeline and collect just the inputs we need to craft one high-quality prompt for each phase. pick/answer quickly; defaults are in [brackets].

# Phase 1 — Extract the Thought Framework from the AE document
Goal: have ChatGPT read the AE vision doc and surface the portable “thinking pattern” (not the content).

**Questions**
1) Scope: Which sections should be mirrored for DMs? [Context, Vision/North Star, Problems, Strategy, Role-specific Use Cases, Metrics, Guiding Principles, Future State]
2) Must-keep elements? (e.g., MECE structure, “agentic co-pilot,” first-principles appendix)
3) Must-avoid elements? (e.g., anything CPQ-specific, AE-only workflows)
4) Output style: bullet outline, narrative summary, or both? [both]
5) Depth: how opinionated should the extraction be vs neutral? [moderately opinionated: highlight gaps/opportunities for DM view]
6) Constraints: any company-specific terms to preserve or rename?
7) Evidence tagging: should the prompt instruct ChatGPT to note which parts are directly lifted vs inferred? [yes]

# Phase 2 — Research & Insight Synthesis for District Managers
Goal: equip ChatGPT to research DM-level challenges and opportunities before drafting.

**Questions**
1) Web access: allow browsing to external sources? [yes/no]
2) Source preferences: analyst reports, CRO blogs, sales ops forums, academic? Rank 1-3.

# Phase 3 — Persona & Hierarchy Scaffolding (DM as the actor)
Goal: define how ChatGPT “thinks like a District Manager.”

**Questions**
1) Confirm hierarchy we’ll encode: AE → RM → DM (DM oversees RMs) [confirm/change]
2) DM span of control: typical # of regions/RMs and AEs under them?
3) Core responsibilities to emphasize (choose 5–7): revenue predictability, ARR growth, margin, coverage model, pipeline hygiene, deal risk governance, enablement, cross-portfolio attach, renewals/expansion, partner influence, headcount planning, productivity.
4) Decision rights: what can DM approve/deny/escalate? (discounts, deal structuring, play selection, headcount moves)
5) Operating cadence to model: weekly forecast call, QBRs, pipeline inspections, deal reviews, enablement sessions, 1:1s.
6) Primary pain points (top 5): visibility gaps, strategy dilution, inconsistent execution across RMs, data quality, tool sprawl, coaching bandwidth, renewal leakage, long approvals.
7) North-star outcomes for DM persona (rank): forecast accuracy, variance reduction, growth consistency across regions, time-to-insight, coaching leverage, tool consolidation.
8) Sensitive constraints: data privacy, regulatory/sector limits, partner commitments we must respect?

   - Pricing/CM guardrails & exception workflow
   - Partner-influence insights & conflicts
   - Data quality watchdog & hygiene nudges
3) Agentic actions allowed? (e.g., auto-draft RM coaching notes, auto-create tasks, propose roll-ups, prefill QBR packs)
4) Guardrails: what must require human approval? (discount exceptions, forecast changes, play activation)
5) Prioritization principle: optimize for few high-impact flows or broad coverage? [few high-impact first]
6) UX expectation: single “Summary for DMs” page with Path-to-Plan, Opportunities, Accounts, Tasks—keep this pattern? [yes/no]
7) Interoperability: should DM views cascade down (RM/AE drill-through) and roll up to RVP? [yes]

# Phase 5 — Metrics & Proof of Value
Goal: define how success is measured for the DM workflow.

**Questions**
1) Primary KPIs (pick 5–8): forecast accuracy, commit-to-actual variance, pipeline coverage, stage-to-stage conversion, renewal rate, expansion rate, attach %, avg discount, contribution margin, time spent in forecast meetings, tool consolidation (# tools sunset), enablement search volume ↓, time-to-insight.
2) Baselines available? If not, should ChatGPT propose proxy baselines and target deltas? [yes]
3) Attribution approach: direct (A/B/pilot) vs contribution (trend + instrumentation)?
4) Reporting cadence & owners (DM, RM, RevOps).
5) Adoption goals (e.g., % of RMs using DM Summary weekly).
6) Sunset targets (Slack threads, ad-hoc spreadsheets)—specify which to track.
7) Risk/assumption log: should the prompt force explicit risks and testable assumptions? [yes]

# Phase 6 — Drafting the DM Vision Document
Goal: produce the polished document.

**Questions**
1) Audience & sign-off: who reads this first? (DMs, RMs, RVP, SalesOps, IT)
2) Tone: executive crisp, product-strategy, or enablement-friendly? [executive crisp + product-strategy]
3) Length & format: 4–6 pages narrative with skimmable bullets; include a “Summary” page? [yes]
4) Include sections: Context, Vision, Problems, Strategy, Use Cases, Metrics, Guiding Principles, Future State, Appendix (first principles)? [yes]
5) “Deal scoring” section: include at DM level (portfolio/region scoring, CM guardrails)? [yes/no]
6) Visuals desired: risk heatmap mock, summary dashboard wireframe, RM coaching queue example?
7) Language/terminology to lock (e.g., ARR, R/U/NN, design of record, platformization)?
8) Red-team checks: require a contradictions pass and a “speculation vs evidenced” label? [yes]

# Phase 7 — Refinement & Packaging
Goal: iterate to final.

**Questions**
1) Review criteria: what are the 3 pass/fail gates? (clarity, actionability, exec alignment, measurement rigor)
2) Style alignment: match the AE doc’s structure or modernize? [light modernization, same backbone]
3) Distribution format: PDF deck, doc, or both? [doc + exportable PDF]
4) Change log & versioning: include? [yes]

reply with your answers (bullet or inline). when you're ready, say **“begin creating the prompt”** and I’ll generate one precision prompt per phase, each with: Goal, Return Format, Warnings/Guardrails, and Context & Additional Elements—pre-wired with your choices and an O3 execution persona for that phase.

## You (2025-08-26T19:59:18.731000+00:00)

Phase 1 — Extract the Thought Framework from the AE document

- All sections
- We're extracting the thought and intention of the document so while there are no specific 'Must-keep' elements, I'd say think of the questions posed in thefirst principles appendix as one of the many examples of Must-keep.
- Output style - similar to the document
- depth should match the current document's style.
- Constraints: the GPT should build its constraints based on the knowledge it will inherit as part of the persona. For your reference, I think the research will be the first phase instead of phase 2.


Phase 2 — Research & Insight Synthesis for District Managers
- Web Access: Yes
- Source Preferences: there may not be a lot of research papers for this subject, but i'd say any of the usual suspects for references on the internet would be helpful - like podcasts, interviews, etc.
- No Inpurs available
- I think all the research focus areas you've outlined should be part of the research objective here.
- Comparables: should ChatGPT look at adjacent roles (RVP, CRO) to infer DM needs? - Yes, Absolutely
- Boundaries: No specific boundaries except for focusing on Americas
- Time Horizon: Last 2-3 years.

Phase 3 — Persona & Hierarchy Scaffolding (DM as the actor)

- Confirm hierarchy: AE → RM → DM (DM oversees RMs)
- DM span of control: TBD based on research insights.
- Decision rights: TBD based on research insights.
- Operating cadence to model: TBD based on research insights.
- Primary pain points: TBD based on research insights.
- North-star outcomes for DM persona (rank):  TBD based on research insights.
- Sensitive constraints: None

Phases 4, 5, and 6 will be refined more based on prior phases.

# Phase 1 Prompt — Extract the Thought Framework from the AE Vision Document

## Goal
Distill the transferable **thinking pattern** and underlying intent of the uploaded *AI-Powered Sales Workbench* vision (Account-Executive–focused) so we can adapt it for **District Managers (DMs)** later—without copying content. Your job is to surface the document’s structure, logic moves, and decision criteria across **all sections**, mirroring the document’s tone and depth.

## Return Format
Produce a document that **looks and feels like the source** (headings, section flow, concise paragraphs + bullets). Include these sections:

1) **Purpose of Each Section (All Sections)**
   - For every section in the source (Context, Vision/North Star, Problems, Strategy, Use Cases, Metrics, Guiding Principles, Conclusion, Appendix/First-Principles, Addendum/Agentic Co-Pilot), write:
     - *Role in the argument* (what it’s doing)
     - *What good looks like* (quality bar for that section when we rewrite for DMs)

2) **Reasoning Moves & Patterns**
   - Enumerate the author’s “moves” (e.g., life-of-role pain study → clustered problems → AI design patterns → role-tailored use cases → measurable KPIs → guiding principles → agentic future).
   - Capture how evidence, prioritization, and trade-offs are presented.

3) **Transferrable Questions Set**
   - A bank of **portable prompts/questions** we must ask when adapting to any role (include the **first-principles** style questions and similar probes; keep them generic and reusable).

4) **Constraint Envelope (Source-Inferred)**
   - The constraints implied by the document (e.g., unify fragmented tools; MECE clarity; data integrity; role-tailoring; iterative ship-fast ethos; agentic path).
   - Keep this **source-derived only** (do **not** add DM persona constraints yet).

5) **Patterns to Keep / Elements to Avoid**
   - Keep: structural spine, measurable North Star, research-backed problems, summary page concept, agentic evolution narrative, etc.
   - Avoid: AE-specific feature details, hardwiring AE workflows, quoting or copying text.

6) **Adaptation Hooks for the DM Version**
   - For each original section, list the *inputs* we’ll need later (e.g., DM pain signals, span-of-control metrics, forecast variance drivers, coaching cadences) and the *decision rules* the DM doc should make explicit.

7) **Evidence Tagging**
   - When you reference the source, include minimal **page call-outs** like *(see source, “Guiding Principles”)*. Do not quote more than short phrases; no chain-of-thought.

## Warnings & Guardrails
- **No verbatim copying** beyond short phrases. Summarize intentions, not sentences.
- **Match tone & depth** of the original: executive-crisp, product-strategy, research-aware.
- **Separate SOURCE vs INFERENCE:**
  - Tag each bullet with **[SOURCE]** (directly grounded in the doc) or **[INFERRED]** (your abstraction).
- **No chain-of-thought** in the output. Provide clear, public-safe reasoning only.
- **Do not invent DM content** here. This phase refrains from persona decisions (that comes after research).

## Context & Additional Elements
- Audience is internal product/sales leadership.
- Hierarchy context (for later phases): AE → RM → DM (DM oversees RMs).
- Style: mirror the source’s sectioning and “North Star → problems → strategy/use cases → metrics → principles → future state” cadence.
- Quality bar: clear, MECE, skimmable; every section states *why it exists*, *how it’s used*, *how to adapt*.

**Execution Persona (O3):** *Product-Strategy Analyst & RevOps Architect* — expert at structural deconstruction of strategy docs; emphasizes MECE structure and evidence hygiene.

# Phase 2 Prompt — Research & Insight Synthesis for District Managers (Americas, last 2–3 years)

> Note: Although numbered “Phase 2,” this research can run **first** in the overall workflow if preferred.

## Goal
Conduct focused web research to surface **District Manager (DM)** realities in enterprise B2B sales (Americas, last 24–36 months). Produce a **grounded picture** of DM responsibilities, pain points, operating cadences, decision rights, and success metrics—plus testable hypotheses and input values needed to author the DM vision document.

## Return Format
Deliver a **research dossier** with these sections:

1) **Method & Scope (5–8 bullets)**
   - What you searched, where (podcasts, interviews, CRO/RVP blogs, analyst notes, RevOps forums), and date bounds.

2) **Evidence Table** (markdown table)
   Columns: *Source | Type (podcast/interview/article/report) | Date | Region | Role Focus (DM/RVP/CRO) | Key Claim (≤20 words) | Relevance to DM | Evidence Grade (A/B/C) | Link*
   - 12–20 diverse, high-quality items; prioritize last 2–3 years; Americas focus; include adjacent roles (RVP/CRO) if illuminating DM needs.

3) **Synthesized Insights (Top 10–15, clustered)**
   - Cluster under: **Visibility & Forecasting**, **Execution & Governance**, **People & Coaching**, **Systems & Data**, **Customers & Revenue**.
   - For each insight: *Why it matters*, *Signals/metrics to watch*, *Risks if ignored*, *Confidence (High/Med/Low)*, *Representative sources*.

4) **Persona Parameters to Fill** *(for Phase 3 scaffolding)*
   - **Span of control** (typical ranges), **decision rights** (discount guardrails, exception handling, play activation), **operating cadence** (forecast calls, QBRs, pipeline inspections, 1:1s), **primary pain points**, **north-star outcomes** (ranked).
   - Provide recommended **default ranges** with rationale + sources.

5) **Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) for DMs**
   - 6–10 JTBD statements (outcome-oriented), each with *measurable success criteria* and *candidate metrics*.

6) **Hypotheses & Tests**
   - 6–8 testable hypotheses (e.g., “If DM receives automated variance drivers by product/region weekly, commit-to-actual variance reduces by X%”).
   - Pair each with *test design* (data needed, pilot unit, success threshold).

7) **Implications for the DM Workbench**
   - Map insights to **top DM use cases** (forecast roll-ups, heatmaps, coaching queues, renewal risk early-warning, attach propensity, data hygiene watchdog, CM guardrails).
   - Note any **agentic actions** that should be allowed vs require approval.

8) **Open Questions & Research Backlog**
   - Items to resolve before drafting (e.g., partner-influence metrics, renewal segmentation, telemetry availability).

## Warnings & Guardrails
- **Use browsing.** Favor reputable sources; include podcasts/interviews with CRO/RVP/RevOps leaders where they discuss operating cadence, coaching, forecasting, renewal/expansion.
- **Citations required.** Every fact goes in the Evidence Table with links; synthesized sections must **reference specific rows** (e.g., “S3, S7”).
- **Distinguish fact vs synthesis.** Tag lists with **[FACT]** or **[SYNTH]** and add **Confidence**.
- **Recency filter.** Prioritize last 24–36 months; if older but definitive, justify.
- **Americas focus.** If a global source is used, explain why it generalizes.
- **Balance & contradictions.** If sources disagree, present both and explain.
- **No chain-of-thought.** Provide concise reasoning; no internal reasoning traces.
- **Privacy & ethics.** Do not include private or scraped personal data; use public material only.

## Context & Additional Elements
- This research will inform Phase 3 persona scaffolding and the Phase 4–6 workflow and metrics design.
- Include **metrics language** aligned with sales leadership (forecast accuracy/variance, pipeline coverage/quality, renewal rate, expansion/attach %, contribution margin, time-to-insight, tool consolidation, enablement search volume).
- Incorporate adjacent-role insight (RVP/CRO) where it clarifies **DM decision rights** and **operating cadence**.
- Output should be **executive-crisp**, skimmable, and decision-ready.

**Execution Persona (O3):** *AI Researcher & Sales Leadership Analyst (RevOps-first)* — skilled at triangulating modern sales-org practices, building evidence-backed personas, and translating findings into measurable operating implications.

## You (2025-08-26T20:11:22.438000+00:00)

help me think through this.

I'm of the opinion that first we should build a scaffolding for a DM at Palo Alto Networks, and have that scaffolded persona perform all the other actions. But I'm not fully sure, I need an objective, critical analysis.





## ChatGPT (2025-08-26T20:11:23.817496+00:00)

Great question. Here’s an objective take on **“Persona-first” (scaffold the DM and let it drive everything)** vs alternatives, plus a practical recommendation with guardrails.

# Option A — Persona-first (your proposal)
**What it is:** Build a detailed Palo Alto Networks DM scaffold (responsibilities, decision rights, cadence, metrics, constraints) and then have that persona execute research, extract frameworks, and draft the vision.

**Upside**
- **Coherence:** Every downstream artifact shares the same lens; cleaner through-line from problem → strategy → metrics.
- **Decision integrity:** DM decision rights/constraints shape what the “Workbench” should actually do (e.g., what can be automated vs must be approved).
- **Faster convergence:** Clear “who is speaking” prevents generic output.

**Risk**
- **Anchoring/confirmation bias:** If the initial scaffold is off, you’ll get a beautifully consistent—but wrong—deliverable.
- **Blind spots:** A role-primed model can filter research to match the persona’s assumptions.
- **Overfitting:** You might encode org-specific quirks too early and miss better patterns from adjacent roles (RVP/CRO) or industry.

**When it wins**
- Org context is well known; you can quickly validate the scaffold with 1–2 leaders.
- You need decisive, prescriptive output over exploratory breadth.

**When it fails**
- You lack reliable inputs (span of control, decision rights, cadence); or the role varies substantially across districts.

# Option B — Framework-first (extract AE thought structure → then persona)
**What it is:** Neutral pass to capture the portable thinking pattern; only then build the DM persona to fit that structure.

**Upside**
- **Low bias:** You don’t lock assumptions before understanding the “why/how” spine.
- **Reuse:** Ensures your DM doc keeps the strong logic (North Star → Problems → Strategy → Use cases → Metrics → Principles → Future) without AE specifics.

**Risk**
- **Abstraction drift:** “Neutral” output can get vague; later persona work has to retrofit specifics.

**Best for**
- When the source framework is strong and you want to preserve its argumentative shape.

# Option C — Split-track (recommended)
Run two fast, controlled tracks that meet in the middle:

1) **Neutral Structure Track**
   Extract the *thinking pattern* from the AE doc with zero DM assumptions (framework, section purposes, reasoning moves, evidence standards).

2) **Proto-Persona Track**
   Do **Americas-focused research** (last 24–36 months) to produce a **proto-DM scaffold**: span-of-control ranges, decision rights, operating cadence, top pains, north-star outcomes—with **confidence tags** and source citations.

Then **merge**: adapt the neutral framework using only **proto-persona items at High/Medium confidence**; keep Low-confidence items parked in an “assumptions” box and out of core decisions.

---

## Why the split-track wins
- **Reduces bias** (structure stays neutral) **and** preserves **coherence** (persona informs decisions).
- **Traceability:** You can point to which persona assumptions are evidence-backed vs provisional.
- **Fail-safe:** If research updates the persona, the neutral structure doesn’t collapse.

---

## Guardrails to make Persona-first safe (if you still prefer A)
If you want to go all-in on persona-first, add these controls:

1) **Assumption Ledger:** Every persona claim carries *Confidence (H/M/L)* + *Source* + *Test plan*.
2) **Dual-Persona Review:** After the DM-persona drafts, run an *Adversarial Research Analyst* pass to challenge each claim (look for counter-examples).
3) **Disconfirming Queries:** Force at least 3 searches aimed at disproving the persona’s top 5 beliefs.
4) **Decision Rights Table:** Anything the persona can “approve” in-flow must be explicitly listed; all else **requires human approval**.
5) **Scenario Tests (“unit tests” for the persona):**
   - Forecast miss in one region with partner conflict.
   - Coverage gap on new product; attach goals at risk.
   - Renewal cliff with poor adoption signals; PS handoff friction.
   The persona must propose actions and metrics you’d actually accept.

---

## Minimal artifacts before drafting (whichever path)
- **Framework One-Pager (neutral):** section purposes, reasoning moves, evidence bar.
- **Proto-Persona One-Pager:**
  - Span of control (range), operating cadence (weekly, monthly, quarterly), decision rights, top pains, north-star outcomes (ranked), metrics stack.
  - Each item tagged H/M/L confidence with sources.
- **Assumption Ledger & Test Plan:** how we’ll validate any Medium/Low claims.
- **Metric Definitions:** forecast accuracy, commit-to-actual variance, pipeline coverage, renewal/expansion, attach %, contribution margin, time-to-insight, tool consolidation.

---

## Concrete recommendation
- **Adopt Option C (Split-track).** Start with a neutral framework extraction (very quick), in parallel with a research-driven proto-persona. Merge only High/Medium-confidence persona elements into the DM vision; quarantine Low-confidence into a “future validation” appendix.
- If you *strongly* prefer Persona-first, run it with the **five guardrails** above to avoid elegant-but-wrong outputs.

---

## If you want, I can…
- Spin up a **proto-persona scaffold template** (with confidence tags) and a **neutral framework checklist** so we can lock both artifacts quickly and proceed to the DM vision with fewer surprises.

## You (2025-08-26T20:41:53.046000+00:00)

we need to revisit the prompt for phase 1. I was expecting a clear document similar to the one i attached. Here is the outpput I received.

# Distillation of the *Thinking Pattern* in the **AI‑Powered Sales Workbench** Vision

*(for later adaptation to District Managers — without copying content)*

---

## 1) Purpose of Each Section *(All Sections)*

> For every section below: **Role in the argument** (what it’s doing) and **What good looks like** (quality bar when we rewrite for DMs).

### Context *(p.2)*

* **Role in the argument**

  * **\[SOURCE]** Orients readers to a cross‑functional initiative to unify GTM workflows and insights for field roles; establishes scope and collaborators.&#x20;
* **What good looks like (DM rewrite)**

  * **\[INFERRED]** Crisp scope (“who/what/why now”), explicit stakeholders (SalesOps, IT, RevOps, Enablement, Finance), and the DM audience *and* adjacency roles; 1–2 sentences on current fragmentation pain the DM org recognizes.

### Vision / North Star *(p.2)*

* **Role in the argument**

  * **\[SOURCE]** Sets a unifying aspiration: a personalized workbench that consolidates data and workflows, evolves core motions (e.g., quoting) into a conversational, iterative, agent‑assisted experience, and names four top‑level success themes.&#x20;
* **What good looks like (DM rewrite)**

  * **\[INFERRED]** A single, memorable North Star with 3–5 measurable, business‑anchored outcomes for DMs (coverage health, forecast quality, team productivity, risk visibility), phrased as *destination, not features*.

### Problems We Plan to Address *(pp.3–5)*

* **Role in the argument**

  * **\[SOURCE]** Grounds the case in “day‑in‑the‑life” research: tool sprawl, diluted strategy in execution, lack of proactive insights, lost technical validation signals, complexity in deal construction, inconsistent value storytelling, and value erosion in handoffs. The two *Life of a Seller* diagrams summarize activities, pain points, and impact across the funnel.&#x20;
* **What good looks like (DM rewrite)**

  * **\[INFERRED]** MECE, research‑backed problem set for the DM layer (team‑level inspection burden, span‑of‑control information gaps, coaching signal loss, territory design friction, renewal/expansion blind spots) with “evidence snippets” from shadowing, time–motion, and system logs.

### Strategy *(pp.5–6)*

* **Role in the argument**

  * **\[SOURCE]** Commits to a unified, Salesforce‑embedded “single pane” with AI woven three ways: context‑sensitive assistance, intelligent summaries, and AI‑powered workflows; announces role‑tailored use‑case modules under a consolidated workspace.&#x20;
* **What good looks like (DM rewrite)**

  * **\[INFERRED]** A platform‑first strategy that clarifies modularity, integration boundaries, and a staged rollout plan tied to DM outcomes (e.g., inspection quality) — *why this architecture unlocks DM behaviors at scale*.

### Use Cases *(pp.6–7)*

* **Role in the argument**

  * **\[SOURCE]** Enumerates core modules (e.g., unified dashboard/summary page, account research, quoting, proposal content, value‑based materials, renewals, sales plays, forecasting) and highlights *risk‑based filtering* to focus attention.&#x20;
* **What good looks like (DM rewrite)**

  * **\[INFERRED]** Each module is a “job‑to‑be‑done” with inputs/outputs, success flags, and *behavior it changes*. Include a one‑page “Summary” concept tuned to the DM cockpit (path‑to‑plan, risk/coverage, accounts/teams, actions).

### How We Will Measure Success *(pp.7, 11)*

* **Role in the argument**

  * **\[SOURCE]** Puts adoption and productivity at the top; then maps KPIs to each module. An addendum proposes BHAG‑style outcomes (e.g., “tools sunset,” “searches go down,” increase in zero‑touch flows).&#x20;
* **What good looks like (DM rewrite)**

  * **\[INFERRED]** Tiered metrics: (1) platform adoption and consolidation, (2) module‑level KPIs, (3) business outcomes (forecast accuracy, renewal confidence), (4) behavior proxies (inspection time reduced, coaching cycles increased).

### Guiding Principles *(p.8)*

* **Role in the argument**

  * **\[SOURCE]** States decision rules: modularity, ship‑and‑iterate, pilot with real deals, data‑over‑opinion, MECE clarity, integrate familiar tools, and nudge growth priorities.&#x20;
* **What good looks like (DM rewrite)**

  * **\[INFERRED]** Principles expressed as trade‑off filters (e.g., *clarity over breadth*, *measured rollout over big‑bang*) plus “how we’ll use them” during roadmap and design reviews.

### Conclusion *(p.8)*

* **Role in the argument**

  * **\[SOURCE]** Reframes the workbench as a strategic shift: unify, automate, personalize to improve how we acquire, grow, inspect, and run customer relationships.&#x20;
* **What good looks like (DM rewrite)**

  * **\[INFERRED]** A succinct “so what” for execs: *why this matters now* for P\&L and operating cadence; one paragraph tying back to the North Star and next decision gates.

### Appendix / First‑Principles *(p.9)*

* **Role in the argument**

  * **\[SOURCE]** Deconstructs selling to irreducible jobs, constraints (system friction, human limits, data entropy), and “must‑be‑true” conditions (automate, augment, make customer intent liquid) made feasible by LLMs and APIs.&#x20;
* **What good looks like (DM rewrite)**

  * **\[INFERRED]** A first‑principles breakdown of the DM job, constraints, and enabling conditions; used to sanity‑check scope and prevent tool‑led thinking.

### Addendum / Agentic Co‑Pilot *(p.10)*

* **Role in the argument**

  * **\[SOURCE]** Outlines the evolution from insights to an *agentic* flow where AI listens across channels, proposes options, the human curates, and teams iterate rapidly with lower risk.&#x20;
* **What good looks like (DM rewrite)**

  * **\[INFERRED]** A clear near‑to‑future narrative for DM work: what the agent senses, suggests, and automates; what remains a human decision; and guardrails.

## ChatGPT (2025-08-26T20:41:53.966126+00:00)

Got it — thank you for pasting the output. I see exactly what happened.

The **Phase 1 prompt** I drafted told the model to *distill the “thinking pattern”* and produce an **analyst’s meta-document** (roles, what-good-looks-like, transferable questions, adaptation hooks). That’s why you got something that looks like a **commentary + annotated outline**, not a **vision document clone**.

Let’s analyze critically:

---

## What worked
- It preserved **structure fidelity** (Context, Vision, Problems, Strategy, Use Cases, Metrics, Principles, Future).
- It clearly labeled **[SOURCE] vs [INFERRED]**, which makes the thought process transparent.
- It generated **adaptation hooks** (inputs + decision rules) that will be useful for DM scaffolding.

## What didn’t match your expectation
- **Style mismatch**: You expected a document *similar to the AE vision doc* (executive narrative with flow), but the prompt created a **meta-analysis guide**.
- **Readability**: It reads like a teaching note for prompt engineers rather than a vision doc that you could drop into an executive pack.
- **Verbosity**: Each section has “role of argument / what good looks like,” which creates double-layered text instead of a single flowing story.
- **Abstraction level**: It sat one level above (“framework to adapt”) instead of *mirroring the doc* in voice, formatting, and tone.

---

## Two ways forward

### Path A — Keep Analyst Lens (current style)
Use Phase 1 as an *internal design artifact* (for you and me). It’s highly useful for us as builders, but it’s not an executive-facing document.

### Path B — Refocus Phase 1 Prompt (your intent)
If you want the output to **look like the AE vision doc**, then the Phase 1 prompt should explicitly say:

- *“Write a synthetic Vision Document that mirrors the structure, tone, and flow of the AE document — but with **neutral placeholder content** (e.g., <Insert DM Problems Here>) instead of meta commentary.”*
- That way, you’ll get a **draft “vision shell”** that *feels like the AE doc* but is empty of persona details. This shell then becomes the canvas into which research + persona insights flow.

---

## Recommendation
Use **two artifacts**:
1. **Phase 1A (Framework Distillation)** → keep what you already have: meta-analysis, adaptation hooks, [SOURCE]/[INFERRED]. (For us, the builders.)
2. **Phase 1B (Vision Shell Draft)** → new prompt that tells ChatGPT: *“Recreate the AE vision document’s structure and narrative style, but replace AE specifics with role-neutral placeholders.”* (For exec readability and as a scaffold to be filled with DM content later.)

---

👉 Would you like me to **rewrite the Phase 1 prompt** into this “Vision Shell” style, so the output you get next time looks like the doc you attached — same headings, same executive tone, but persona-neutral placeholders waiting to be filled?

# Emoji Suggestions for Filters

## You (2025-07-08T18:41:47.410000+00:00)

Hey, I have a series of risk factors. 

They'll be used as filters. They only have binary values - Yes/No. And they're applicable for any and all account. 

Now, I need to use them in a UI, and I need an appropriate emoji to avoid using an icon. Could you give me some suggestions?

One thing i want to keep in mind, I'm hoping that the emojis are less commonly used. For example - an alert emoji ‼️ is fairly common and generic so this would be a bad option for these filters. 

Here's the list. 

Pipeline in CQ + Next 4Q
EBCs in last year
Secured technical win
Partner selected or finalized 
Customer is technically healthy 
Customer adoption/deployment rate is low
Mandatory PS was removed
Quotes pending approval
Budget conversation not scheduled or complete
Term length greater than 3 years or with financing/billing plans being proposed 
No activity for last 30 days

## ChatGPT (2025-07-08T18:41:48.190029+00:00)

Got it — we're looking for emojis that are binary-compatible (✅/❌-style yes/no), but less mainstream than the usual alert or checkmark ones. They should serve as unique, visual filters that subtly reinforce the meaning without clutter. Here's a list of emoji suggestions for each filter, with rationale behind the choices:

---

1. **Pipeline in CQ + Next 4Q**  
🪜 *(Ladder)* – Symbolizes pipeline "steps" or stages across quarters, visually distinct and rarely used.

2. **EBCs in last year**  
🗺️ *(World map)* – Reflects strategic engagement and travel; used less than 🏢 or 🏛️ for business.

3. **Secured technical win**  
🧬 *(DNA strand)* – Implies technical rigor and success in engineering-centric validation.

4. **Partner selected or finalized**  
🧩 *(Puzzle piece)* – Represents fit and alignment, often underutilized but intuitive.

5. **Customer is technically healthy**  
🫀 *(Anatomical heart)* – Denotes health with a technical feel, more literal than ❤️.

6. **Customer adoption/deployment rate is low**  
🌒 *(Waxing crescent moon)* – Visually shows something not fully deployed; underutilized but expressive.

7. **Mandatory PS was removed**  
⚖️ *(Balance scale)* – Represents a policy shift or negotiated exception, with subtle legal/regulatory undertone.

8. **Quotes pending approval**  
📑 *(Bookmark tabs/document)* – Distinct from just 📄, and signals formal docs in a queue.

9. **Budget conversation not scheduled or complete**  
📉 *(Chart decreasing)* – A rare business emoji signaling financial gaps or missing clarity.

10. **Term length > 3 years or complex billing**  
📆 *(Tear-off calendar)* – Not generic like 🕒, but still signals time span with clarity.

11. **No activity for last 30 days**  
🌫️ *(Fog)* – Abstract but poetic; implies inactivity, lack of visibility, or disengagement.

If you're considering accessibility or text parsing too, I can tag each one by UTF-8 width and visual ambiguity. Want to narrow to the most expressive + least common set next?

## You (2025-07-08T18:43:48.778000+00:00)

My feeling is, these emojis are a bit too abstract for someone to be immediately aligned with the names.

## ChatGPT (2025-07-08T18:43:49.591225+00:00)

Totally fair — when filters need to be **glanceable and self-evident**, abstract emojis (like 🪷 or 🌫️) slow down comprehension. Let’s pivot to more **concrete, intuitive emoji options** that still avoid the overused tier like ✅, ❌, or ‼️ — striking a better balance between **clarity and uniqueness**.

Here’s a revised pass, optimized for **immediate recognition**, with the best-fit emoji **listed first** per filter:

---

### **1. Pipeline in CQ + Next 4Q**
- 📈 *(Increasing chart)* – Intuitive for pipeline growth.
- 🗂️ *(File folders)* – Stages or organized quarters.
- 🔢 *(Numbered list)* – Sequencing quarters.

---

### **2. EBCs in last year**
- 🏛️ *(Classical building)* – Executive presence.
- 🧳 *(Luggage)* – Visitor travel.
- 🪪 *(ID card)* – Logged attendance.

---

### **3. Secured technical win**
- 🏅 *(Medal)* – Clear win.
- 🧪 *(Test tube)* – Lab/POV validated.
- 📣 *(Megaphone)* – Declared win.

---

### **4. Partner selected or finalized**
- 🤝 *(Handshake)* – Universal and literal.
- 📜 *(Scroll)* – Formal agreement.
- 🧩 *(Puzzle piece)* – Still a strong metaphor for alignment.

---

### **5. Customer is technically healthy**
- 🟢 *(Green circle)* – Visual cue of "healthy."
- 🩺 *(Stethoscope)* – Diagnostic success.
- 💡 *(Light bulb)* – Systems are up and running.

---

### **6. Customer adoption/deployment rate is low**
- 🟡 *(Yellow circle)* – Caution, under-adopted.
- 🐢 *(Turtle)* – Clear metaphor for slowness.
- 🛑 *(Stop sign)* – Blocked progress.

---

### **7. Mandatory PS was removed**
- ✂️ *(Scissors)* – Something was cut.
- 🚫 *(Prohibited)* – Policy denied.
- ⚠️ *(Warning)* – Deviation from best practice.

---

### **8. Quotes pending approval**
- 📨 *(Incoming envelope)* – Awaiting internal action.
- 🗂️ *(File folders)* – Queued quote.
- ⌛ *(Hourglass)* – Waiting period.

---

### **9. Budget conversation not scheduled or complete**
- 💬 *(Speech bubble)* – Conversation not started.
- 🧮 *(Abacus)* – Budget pending.
- 📉 *(Chart down)* – Financial gap.

---

### **10. Term length > 3 years or complex billing**
- 🗓️ *(Calendar)* – Long term.
- 🧾 *(Receipt)* – Billing.
- 🔁 *(Repeat symbol)* – Recurring terms or plans.

---

### **11. No activity for last 30 days**
- 🔕 *(Bell with slash)* – No pings, no motion.
- 🧊 *(Ice cube)* – Cold.
- 💤 *(Zzz)* – Dormant account.

---

This version emphasizes **familiar objects or status signals** so even first-time users can pick up the intent visually. Want me to help create a visual mock or markdown table of these as they’d appear in a UI filter menu?

## You (2025-07-08T18:47:40.162000+00:00)

The ones i'm still not quite happy with are

Customer adoption/deployment rate is low
Mandatory PS was removed
Budget conversation not scheduled or complete

Adoption/deployment is hard to relate with the emojis so far. 
PS stands for Professional Services
And for Budget conversation, we may want to consider something that seems more monetary.

## ChatGPT (2025-07-08T18:47:41.093066+00:00)

Great call — those three are trickier and deserve sharper metaphor-emojis that nail the mental model instantly. Here's a refined and more intentional set for each of those:

---

### **Customer adoption/deployment rate is low**
The key here is to imply **incomplete rollout** or **weak engagement**, ideally in a visually intuitive way:

- 🧱 *(Brick)* – Product present but not fully "built out."
- 📦 *(Package)* – Delivered but not opened/used.
- 🧃 *(Juice box)* – Quirky, but signals “only partially consumed.”
- 🪫 *(Low battery)* – Perfect metaphor for under-utilization (underused emoji too).

✅ **Top pick:** 🪫 — It’s rare, visually distinct, and immediately implies low energy/usage.

---

### **Mandatory PS was removed**
Now that we’re emphasizing **Professional Services** being taken out of scope (often against guidance), these options focus on **exclusion or bypass of expert help**:

- 🧑‍🏫 *(Person teaching)* – Represents PS — if grayed out, implies removed.
- 🚷 *(No pedestrians)* – Access denied or guidance removed.
- ✂️ *(Scissors)* – Something cut from scope.
- 🧾 ➖ *(Receipt + minus)* – Visually conveys line item removed.

✅ **Top pick:** ✂️ — Visually quick and neutral, instantly implies “cut.”

Alternative (more playful): 🧑‍🏫🚫 — For tooltips or hover states, combining PS persona + “not allowed.”

---

### **Budget conversation not scheduled or complete**
We want this to say “financial planning hasn’t happened,” not necessarily negative, but *incomplete*.

- 🪙 *(Coin)* – Visual currency, rare and modern.
- 🧮 *(Abacus)* – Budget planning; underused but clear.
- 💬➕ *(Speech bubble + plus)* – Conversation yet to start.
- 🏦 *(Bank)* – Institutional budget context.

✅ **Top pick:** 🪙 — A unique money symbol, avoids 💸’s negative tone and 💵’s overuse.

---

Let me know if you want inline mockups or hover-text suggestions too. These would pair really well with subtle color-backing to reinforce meaning.

Okay, thanks for all this. For now, I need your help hypothesizing some numbers. So, if you look at the chart I gave you, it references certain numbers for closed, commit, and best case. Now, you can look at the fiscal years and the fiscal quarters, and you can look at the corresponding bar length. And just for your information, the red line in each bar, that's the target for either the quarter or the year. Now, could you help me hypothesize some numbers that can somewhat align with the bar lengths? That would be very helpful. So, I need numbers for the plan, which is the red line, and I will need numbers for closed, commit, and best case in.

## ChatGPT (2025-07-08T20:34:24.386323+00:00)

Thanks — I've isolated the bars for each time period, and now I'll estimate the **relative lengths** of Closed, Commit, Best Case – In, and Plan (target) from the visuals. I'll then map those proportions to a hypothetical numeric baseline (e.g., 100 units per full bar) for consistency across quarters.

Let me calculate and share those estimates next.

Here's a table showing the estimated segment lengths for the pipeline bars, based on color analysis. These give us a rough proportion of how much of each bar is composed of its respective categories like Closed, Commit, and Best Case - In. Let me know if you'd like to translate these proportions into hypothetical revenue numbers (e.g., scaling to a $ value or quota baseline).

Appreciate your patience — let’s align properly. You’re asking for **hypothetical dollar values** that correspond to the lengths of each segment in the bar chart. The chart has:

- **Closed** (dark blue)
- **Commit** (blue)
- **Best Case - In** (light blue)
- **Plan** (represented by the red vertical line — target)

Before I calculate, here are **key questions** to ensure I give you what you actually need:

---

### 🧠 Understanding Your Intent

1. **What is the typical quota or "plan" value for each bar?**
   - Should I assume a flat $10M for each (as I initially did)?
   - Or do you want a different value per quarter/fiscal year?

2. **Do you want the values to be based strictly on the visual bar lengths?**
   - i.e., treat the full bar (up to the red line) as 100% of plan and map segment pixel lengths proportionally?

3. **Should the red line (target) be interpreted as the exact "Plan" value?**
   - Meaning: if the red line is ~80% of the total bar, the plan = $8M, not $10M?

4. **Do you need total pipeline (Closed + Commit + Best Case-In) to possibly exceed Plan?**
   - This sometimes happens in actual deals — just want to confirm if you'd like to keep it that way.

5. **Should we exclude the “Remainder” (light grey) segment entirely?**
   - It looks like it's the gap between pipeline and plan — should we just use it for reference?

---

Once I get your answers, I’ll calculate:
- Plan (based on red line)
- Closed, Commit, Best Case-In (based on proportional bar segment lengths relative to the red line)
- Possibly Coverage Ratios, if that’s helpful (pipeline vs. plan)

Let’s lock the logic first — then I’ll build you real-world-aligned estimates.

## You (2025-07-08T20:38:56.256000+00:00)

You can assume any number for the quota or plan for each bar. Just know that the first three bars are quarterly quotas and the last bar is a fiscal year quota or plan. So it's more of an annual number. Yeah, it doesn't have to be strictly based on the bar lengths because this is just a mock-up for a UI. So it can totally be hypothetical. Accuracy is not the goal. Just getting numbers that somewhat make sense is the goal. Yes, it should be interpreted as the plan value. So if you assume 10 million as the plan for a quarter, then the red line should indicate the location for 10 million. Now, if you notice that in the last quarter line, which is the second bar, the red line is not at the end of the bar, implying that the closed value was higher than the plan value, meaning they exceeded their attainment goal. Yeah, you can exclude the remainder like gray section entirely.

## ChatGPT (2025-07-08T20:38:57.104704+00:00)

Perfect — that clears it up completely. Here's the working logic I’ll use to generate **hypothetical numbers** that match your UI:

---

### ✅ Working Assumptions
- **Bars 1–3** (Q4FY25, Q3FY25, Q1FY26): Quarterly plans → assume **$10M each**
- **Bar 4** (FY26): Annual plan → assume **$40M**
- **Red line = Plan**
- **Bar segments = Closed, Commit, Best Case-In**, values are **estimated by visual proportion** relative to the red line (Plan)
- **Gray "remainder" is ignored**
- You want numbers that are realistic for an AE book, but don’t have to be precise — just **visually aligned mock values**

---

### 📊 Next Step

I'll now generate:
- **Plan**
- **Closed**
- **Commit**
- **Best Case - In**

For each period, with the constraints above. One moment while I draft the table.

## ChatGPT (2025-07-08T20:39:01.558561+00:00)

Here’s a set of **mocked-up pipeline values** that align visually with the bars and your explanation. These are **realistic AE-scale values** that assume $10M quarterly quotas and a $40M annual goal:

---

### 📈 Hypothetical Values (in USD)

| Period                   | Plan     | Closed   | Commit   | Best Case - In |
|--------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Current Quarter - Q4FY25** | $10,000,000 | $2,200,000 | $5,800,000 | $1,300,000      |
| **Last Quarter - Q3FY25**    | $10,000,000 | $12,000,000 | $0        | $0              |
| **Next Quarter - Q1FY26**    | $10,000,000 | $900,000   | $2,300,000 | $4,800,000      |
| **Next Fiscal Year - FY26**  | $40,000,000 | $1,000,000 | $9,000,000 | $11,000,000     |

---

### 🔍 Notes:
- **Q4FY25**: In-progress quarter, ~90% of plan visible in pipeline.
- **Q3FY25**: Closed exceeded plan → indicates strong prior attainment.
- **Q1FY26**: Early pipeline shaping; solid best case but low closed.
- **FY26**: Early days, good best case + commit starting to build up.

Let me know if you want to visualize this in a table with emojis or mock UI text, or if you'd like a version with percent coverage per stage.

## You (2025-07-08T21:08:16.486000+00:00)

## ChatGPT (2025-07-08T21:08:17.484010+00:00)

Absolutely — here it is formatted per your spec, with percentages calculated against the **Plan** for each time period:

---

### **Current Quarter – Q4FY25**  
**Closed:**  
$2.2M (22%)  
of  
$10.0M  

**Commit:**  
$5.8M (58%)

Let me know if you want this exported as a snippet for slide decks or integrated into a dashboard mock.

## You (2025-07-08T21:15:57.792000+00:00)

ok, now for the current quarter, could you give me the following numbers (its ok to be hypothetical)

Plan
Closed
Commit
Best Case - In
Total - In
Best Case - Out
Renewal Forecast
Total Forecast

## ChatGPT (2025-07-08T21:16:00.127108+00:00)

Here’s a **hypothetical breakdown for the Current Quarter – Q4FY25**, adding the fields you requested. I’ve kept the numbers logically consistent with a $10M plan and the prior pipeline composition:

---

### **Current Quarter – Q4FY25**

**Plan:**  
$10.0M

**Closed:**  
$2.2M

**Commit:**  
$5.8M

**Best Case – In:**  
$1.3M

**Total – In:**  
$9.3M *(Closed + Commit + Best Case – In)*

**Best Case – Out:**  
$2.7M *(Stretch deals that are not yet in active forecast pipeline)*

**Renewal Forecast:**  
$1.6M *(Expected to renew within quarter)*

**Total Forecast:**  
$10.9M *(Closed + Commit + Best Case – In + Renewal Forecast)*

---

These numbers show a healthy pipeline with slight over-coverage vs. plan (109% forecasted), a typical AE scenario where there’s enough upside and renewals to land above target. Want to do the same breakdown for the next quarter or FY26 next?

## You (2025-07-08T21:19:49.957000+00:00)

and could you also give me the percentages (percentage of plan)

## ChatGPT (2025-07-08T21:19:51.659511+00:00)

Absolutely — here’s the **Current Quarter – Q4FY25** breakdown, now with **percentages relative to the $10M plan**:

---

### **Current Quarter – Q4FY25**

**Plan:**  
$10.0M (100%)

**Closed:**  
$2.2M (22%)

**Commit:**  
$5.8M (58%)

**Best Case – In:**  
$1.3M (13%)

**Total – In:**  
$9.3M (93%)

**Best Case – Out:**  
$2.7M (27%)

**Renewal Forecast:**  
$1.6M (16%)

**Total Forecast:**  
$10.9M (109%)

---

This shows strong pipeline coverage, a likely path to target, and a realistic upside range that many AEs would aim to convert with smart closing plays and renewal velocity. Want to simulate upside cases or waterfall conversion rates next?

## You (2025-07-08T22:29:31.882000+00:00)

Find out the ideal icons that offer the best representation for the following actions to a sales executive. 

Summary
Acquire Product Expertise
Research Accounts
Understand Account Health
Manage Renewal Risk
Drive Upsell and Net New
Generate and Track Quotes
Review Your Forecast

Ensure that your suggestions come from the following icon library
https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/icons/library/

In your response, give me 7 different icon suggestions from the library per action. 
For each action, tell me the 7 names of the icons you review. 

Try and make sure that the icons are mutually exclusive, and align best with the actions given to you. There may be a certain degree of overlap since I've asked for 7 icons, but try ti minimize it in a responsible manner. 

For your context, I need good icons to visually indicate the actions i've given to you in a User Interface. I have access to all the icons in the given library. While searching for icons, you need to think like an account executive and try to understand which icons may align best with the actions in a direct or metaphorical manner. However, direct alignment is more desirable than metaphorical.

Below are **seven mutually-distinct icon ideas per action** drawn from IBM’s Carbon Design System icon set.  
I’ve included the exact **Pascal-case component names** you’ll find in the library so you can drop them straight into code (e.g., `import { Analytics20 } from "@carbon/icons-react"`). Icons were selected for the most literal fit first, metaphorical fit second, and to minimize cross-action overlap.

**Tips for implementation**

* Each icon ships in 16, 20, 24 & 32 px artboards; pick the size that matches your button or tile.  
* Carbon naming is case-sensitive (`ChartPie24`, `Binoculars32`, etc.).  
* Pair icons with clear aria-labels for a11y compliance.  

Feel free to mix & match or ask for a pared-down final set once you see them in situ!

# Competitive Analysis Framework

## You (2024-12-16T11:59:59.937397+00:00)

Hey Michael... This is a presentation you created when you were the director of the MHCI+D program at University of Washington. I really liked the starter framework you proposed for competitive analysis, looking for similar

- goals
- audience
- circumstances
- enablers

Could you help me understand the difference between these 4, with a more detailed example for a product designer? There's one example that's already mentioned in the slide deck.

## ChatGPT (2024-12-16T12:00:38.024337+00:00)

The "starter framework for thoroughness" in competitive analysis you mentioned helps a product designer examine various dimensions to identify similarities and opportunities. Here's a detailed breakdown of the four aspects, supported by the provided example of personal resource sharing among university students:

### 1. **Similar Goals**
   - **Definition**: What does the product aim to achieve? Goals reflect the overarching intent or purpose behind a competitor's offering.
   - **Example from Slide**: Tools like Airbnb and TaskRabbit align with the goal of enabling resource-sharing or temporary access to goods and services. The goal is to facilitate trust-based exchanges.
   - **In Design Terms**: For a designer, assessing this helps to understand if competitors aim to solve similar problems or cater to related needs. For instance, a rental platform's goal might be to reduce waste by sharing unused resources, aligning with sustainability.

### 2. **Similar Audience**
   - **Definition**: Who is using the product? This aspect identifies overlapping demographic, psychographic, or behavioral traits of users.
   - **Example from Slide**: These tools target people such as students who value cost efficiency and flexibility. University students often seek affordable, temporary access to resources.
   - **In Design Terms**: It’s essential to map the audience's specific traits—like age, lifestyle, or technological savvy. A product's design can then be tailored to appeal to this shared user base.

### 3. **Similar Circumstances**
   - **Definition**: Under what context or situation is the product used? Circumstances include timing, location, and external factors influencing product use.
   - **Example from Slide**: Tools such as Lyft or Craigslist address needs arising from immediate or situational demands—whether transportation or finding something quickly.
   - **In Design Terms**: This provides insight into contextual requirements, such as mobile responsiveness for on-the-go usage or how the design handles time-sensitive scenarios.

### 4. **Similar Enablers**
   - **Definition**: What technologies, systems, or infrastructures make the product work? Enablers are the underlying mechanisms that support functionality.
   - **Example from Slide**: Platforms like Airbnb and Depop rely on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and trust-building systems like reviews or secure payments.
   - **In Design Terms**: Designers should analyze whether competitors use specific enablers, such as geolocation APIs, seamless payment integrations, or AI for personalized recommendations, to deliver value.

---

### Applying the Framework
Let’s consider a new hypothetical app for personal resource sharing among students:

#### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Goals**: Reduce waste by promoting the sharing of personal items (e.g., textbooks, kitchenware).
2. **Audience**: University students who value affordability, sustainability, and convenience.
3. **Circumstances**: Usage peaks at the beginning of school terms or during housing transitions.
4. **Enablers**: Mobile-first design with location-based matching, trust features (e.g., user ratings), and integration with campus ID systems.

This framework not only organizes the analysis but also illuminates potential white space for innovation—such as creating features tailored to unique university contexts or enabling more seamless sharing experiences.

## You (2024-12-16T12:17:04.681683+00:00)

Thanks for tht. To give u some context on what I'm doing, I'm working for D^3 at Harvard to identify how we can make event experiences more impactful using AI.

We interviewed 11 participants who were a combination investors, business owners, and people with a background and experience in AI and data science. These were participants who  were among the thousands who attended a recent event we hosted on AI and leadership.

I’m breaking down our observations from the interviews into three spaces.

- Interviewee's opinion on content and presenters
- Interviewee's approach to networking
- Interviewee’s approach to self-education and problem-solving.
Content and Panelists
Content:
- None of the participants we interviewed joined the D^3ed conference with a specific agenda that is centered around the implementation and applications of AI within organizations.
- Some participants who were well versed in AI did state their desire to understand how leaders from different companies view the impact of AI.
- From the POV of experts in AI, the content fell into a balanced middle ground, where it was neither too technical nor too speculative or forward-thinking.
- From the POV of participants not too deep in AI, the conference acted as an introduction to the possibilities of AI, after which they wanted to learn more about applications of AI within their domain.

Interviewees expected the event to be a source of inspiration to either learn about a broad range of AI application. The sentiment was shared by both experts and novices in the field of AI. Given that some wanted variety, and others wanted depth, the event can be seen as a neutral middle ground, allowing attendees to choose their own path moving forward.


Panelists and Presenters:
- AI professionals mentioned a desire to talk to presenters; however, they expressed discomfort because they saw the presenters as celebrities.
- Participants who focus on mentoring startups felt that insights from representatives of large enterprises offered very little actionable information for small businesses.
- Investors with a strong technical background who diligently followed new research in AI had a neutral opinion of the presenters.
- Every participant mentioned Ethan Mollick’s presentation to be the most valuable for their time.


Staying engaged with missed content:
- Not being able to attend a presentation or workshop was seen as a missed opportunity, but given the wealth of content available today, the missed opportunity was not seen as worth pursuing once again.
- Some participants saw value in staying engaged with a forum (or get different attendees’ take) about missed presentations or workshops.


Approach to Networking
- While networking was mentioned as one of the objectives for attending the event, the general sentiment appeared to be relaxed and casual, where making connections was welcomed but not actively pursued with urgency or intensity.
- Whether the lack of networking was due to a lack of opportunity to network, or due to a rather wide variety of people (leaving attendees with few options to meet people with similar backgrounds) cannot be clearly determined from the interviews alone.
- Most participants believed that domain-specific events are more fruitful for pursuing professional relationships.


Self Education and Problem Solving
- The most common theme among participants was the emergence of ChatGPT as the initial source of addressing ambiguities and learning new concepts.
- Investors with advanced knowledge of AI mentioned subscribing to research papers to learn about new trends and advancements.
- Business Owners and investors wanted to talk to trusted experts within their circle for more information.
- 1 person mentioned learning about AI through books.

-----

All that being said, I also identified some opportunities. First, I'd like you to take a look at these two graphics I've attached in a single file.

The upper half represents how we see individual journeys sort of starting out on their own and then eventually diverging out into different paths. The lower half represents what we hope to achieve, with individual pathways organically intersecting with one another, possibly with some AI agents' assistance.

Some of the Opportunities we discovered are

1. Creating networking experiences that don’t feel transactional or professional in the traditional sense.

For Example

Perspective Pairing Spaces:
Where Illyza and Stacy could connect via their shared perspective on entry level job hiring.

Unconference Spaces:
Where Kelly and Monique could connect on their shared critique on presenters and panelists, and possibly help each other.

Contrasting Viewpoints:
Where Nami can discover people in the pursuit of finding different perspectives on the same topic.


2. Encourage collaborative recap discussions or peer driven analysis. This could work with a combination of bite-sized summaries, opinions, peer commentary, or opportunities for asynchronous discussions.

3. Pre-event networking activities could potentially build anticipation and take some of the pressure away from the event schedule. Today, this happens through slack channels and shared docs that have attendee details.

4. Help by providing clearer “choose-your-own-path” in the form of discussions, tailored courses, and specific articles and references.

Based on the information provided, could you help me set the criteria for the Goals, Circumstances, and Enablers? I'm not working on Audience at the moment which I think we can further drill down later.

## ChatGPT (2024-12-16T12:17:47.399581+00:00)

Here’s how you can define the **Goals**, **Circumstances**, and **Enablers** based on the detailed context you provided, using your observations and opportunities:

---

### 1. **Goals**
These are the overarching outcomes you aim to achieve for attendees through enhanced event experiences.

- **Facilitate Meaningful Intersections**: Move networking beyond transactional meetings by creating organic, perspective-driven or contrasting viewpoint opportunities.
- **Empower Reflective Engagement**: Foster collaborative peer analysis or post-event recaps that encourage attendees to synthesize learnings and share insights.
- **Personalized Learning Pathways**: Allow participants to identify and navigate tailored journeys that align with their individual interests, knowledge gaps, and professional needs.
- **Sustain Long-Term Engagement**: Create opportunities for attendees to revisit or interact with event content asynchronously to maintain momentum after the event.

---

### 2. **Circumstances**
These are the specific contexts or conditions under which attendees experience the event or engage with opportunities.

- **Pre-Event Phase**:
   - Attendees often come without a clear agenda but have loose goals like inspiration or knowledge discovery.
   - Building anticipation or familiarity beforehand (e.g., pre-event networking) can reduce pressure and set expectations.
   - Existing mechanisms (e.g., Slack, shared docs) are underutilized as tools to foster meaningful pre-event connections.

- **During the Event**:
   - Networking currently feels relaxed and casual, lacking urgency.
   - Attendees, especially AI professionals, may feel hesitant to approach panelists due to perceived hierarchy or celebrity status.
   - There’s a disconnect between attendee diversity and opportunities for targeted domain-specific connections.
   - Missed sessions are considered “low-priority losses” due to information abundance elsewhere.

- **Post-Event Phase**:
   - Reflection happens in isolation or among trusted circles (e.g., peers, mentors, or ChatGPT).
   - Collaborative recaps or asynchronous spaces could transform missed opportunities into valuable engagement.

---

### 3. **Enablers**
These are tools, technologies, or systems that can facilitate achieving the goals and addressing the circumstances effectively.

- **AI-Powered Pairing Systems**:
   - Use AI agents to match attendees based on shared perspectives, contrasting viewpoints, or overlapping interests.
   - Examples: Perspective Pairing Spaces, Contrasting Viewpoint Matching.

- **Asynchronous Discussion Platforms**:
   - Provide forums or tools where attendees can share bite-sized recaps, commentary, and questions about missed sessions.
   - Examples: Collaborative peer-driven recap spaces, on-demand content summaries with peer reactions.

- **Pre-Event AI Tools for Engagement**:
   - Use AI to automate and recommend pre-event interactions, like suggesting attendee matches, curating introductions, or preparing tailored pre-event materials.
   - Examples: Tailored pre-event Slack integrations or AI-recommended attendee prep lists.

- **Personalized Pathway Recommendations**:
   - Offer “choose-your-own-path” tools using AI-driven content curation.
   - Examples: Tailored recommendations for sessions, post-event articles, discussions, or courses based on attendee goals.

### Example Mapping

| **Criteria**           | **Example**                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Goals**              | Foster natural, perspective-driven networking.                                                |
| **Circumstances**      | Casual networking environments leave opportunities untapped during events.                     |
| **Enablers**           | AI-powered systems to suggest “Perspective Pairing Spaces” or discussions on shared interests. |

By defining the criteria this way, you align **Goals** with your identified opportunities, **Circumstances** with attendee behaviors and pain points, and **Enablers** with potential AI-driven tools to bridge the gaps. Let me know if you'd like me to expand further!

## You (2024-12-16T12:34:19.339313+00:00)

I want you to reconsider this answer, but without imagining AI solutions. Also, please list out the circumstances, goals, and enablers in a way that would help us define a criteria based on which we can later start looking for competitors (whether they're digital/physcial products/services or whether they're just typical hacks that people do in their daily lives).

The lines in the goals section you listed out are fairly good. They focus on criteria rather than reiterating what was already mentioned in the observations and opportunities I shared.

The lines in your circumstances section are simply reiterating what I shared with you. Instead, I'd like a list of circumstances.

With Enablers, I'd like you to forget that we have AI solutions. Imagine you live in 2022 (before chatGPT was launched). Then come up with criteria for enablers.

## ChatGPT (2024-12-16T12:35:14.964173+00:00)

Understood! Let’s rethink this with a clear **criteria-building focus** for evaluating competitors (across tools, services, hacks, or habits). I’ll strip out AI assumptions and provide **clear, listable Goals, Circumstances, and Enablers** to help frame future competitive analysis.

---

### 1. **Goals**
These criteria define what an event experience should achieve for attendees:

1. **Facilitate Contextual Networking**
   - Enable connections that feel meaningful, based on shared interests, perspectives, or problems.
2. **Encourage Collaborative Reflection**
   - Provide opportunities for attendees to collectively synthesize what they learned.
3. **Support Personalized Learning Journeys**
   - Allow attendees to explore content or takeaways that align with their professional focus or learning pace.
4. **Create Asynchronous Value**
   - Help attendees stay engaged after the event with relevant content or interactions.
5. **Reduce Friction in Preparation**
   - Make it easier for attendees to feel prepared, familiar, or connected before the event begins.

---

### 2. **Circumstances**
Circumstances are the specific situations or contexts in which these goals must operate effectively:

1. **Before the Event**
   - Attendees often arrive without a clear personal agenda.
   - Many attendees are unfamiliar with others who will be at the event.
   - There’s limited time or structure to connect with peers before attendance begins.
   - Pre-event schedules can feel overwhelming or unclear.

2. **During the Event**
   - Networking feels casual and unstructured, with limited focus on shared goals or needs.
   - Attendees hesitate to approach speakers or panelists (hierarchy or “celebrity effect”).
   - Connections across diverse audiences (novices, investors, business owners) feel limited.
   - Missing sessions feels inevitable but often not worth backtracking.

3. **After the Event**
   - Attendees reflect in isolation, often only with trusted peers or tools like books and personal notes.
   - Missed sessions, while regretted, rarely warrant proactive catch-up.
   - Sustaining the energy or insights gained at the event requires personal effort.

---

### 3. **Enablers**
Enablers are systems, tools, or mechanisms that can support attendees in meeting their goals under these circumstances.

1. **Frameworks for Shared Discussion**
   - Structured spaces (digital or physical) where people can recap, analyze, or discuss key takeaways together.
   - Examples:
     - Peer-led “recap circles” post-panel discussion.
     - Summary boards where attendees post 1-2 key insights from sessions.

2. **Pre-Event Preparation Materials**
   - Tools or content that help attendees better understand schedules, speakers, or peers beforehand.
   - Examples:
     - Curated speaker bios with suggested preparatory reading.
     - Attendee “introduction cards” with shared focus areas or goals.

3. **Non-Transactional Networking Structures**
   - Activities or prompts that foster meaningful interactions instead of shallow introductions.
   - Examples:
     - Topic-specific networking groups based on shared challenges.
     - Informal conversation starters (e.g., guided Q&A stations).

4. **Asynchronous Learning Resources**
   - Mechanisms that allow attendees to revisit or engage with missed content later.
   - Examples:
     - Short session summaries or keynotes available as handouts.
     - Community-posted takeaways (e.g., “What I learned from this talk” boards).

5. **Focused Connection Opportunities**
   - Environments that bring together attendees with similar or contrasting viewpoints for discussion.
   - Examples:
     - Unconference spaces with open discussion topics (e.g., “Hiring in AI: Opportunities & Challenges”).
     - Perspective pairing exercises where attendees reflect on common problems.

---

### Example Criteria for Competitor Identification

From the above, you can begin looking for competitors by asking:

- **Goals**:
   - Does this product/service/event foster shared discussions or reflection among peers?
   - Does it reduce friction in connecting people with shared challenges or perspectives?
   - Does it support attendees’ ability to personalize their learning path?

- **Circumstances**:
   - Does it focus on pre-event preparation, in-event experience, or post-event reflection?
   - Does it address the lack of structured networking during events?
   - Does it sustain attendee engagement after the main event ends?

- **Enablers**:
   - Does it provide structured formats for recap or discussion (e.g., summaries, discussion prompts)?
   - Does it encourage preparation or familiarity (e.g., curated reading, intros)?
   - Does it help attendees revisit missed sessions or insights asynchronously?
   - Does it facilitate networking beyond professional “transactional” norms?

This structure gives you clear **criteria** for evaluating any competitor—whether it’s an existing product, an offline habit (e.g., recap circles), or physical/digital spaces (e.g., unconferences or topic boards).

## You (2024-12-16T12:40:52.472304+00:00)

Based on our discussion, could you share your opinions? More specifically, I'd like you to pen down criteria for circumstances and examples of competitors. Whether its digital platforms like slack, reddit or LinkedIn (these are just examples, I'm not instructing you to literally pick them), or physical products/services, or general hacks, things that people do, actions they take, etc... For now, lets avoid AI solutions as part of examples.

## ChatGPT (2024-12-16T12:41:58.259694+00:00)

Here’s a refined take with clear **criteria for circumstances** and actionable **examples of competitors** (whether platforms, services, habits, or hacks). I’ll keep AI solutions out of the scope, focusing instead on practical tools and practices people already use.

---

## **Criteria for Circumstances**

To evaluate competitors, we need criteria that identify how tools, services, or habits address the situations (circumstances) attendees face **before, during, and after events**:

1. **Pre-Event Circumstances**
   - Attendees lack a clear agenda or focus before arriving.
   - Attendees don’t know who else is attending, limiting opportunities to connect early.
   - Attendees experience information overload (too many options, unclear value).
   - Minimal structures exist to set expectations or help attendees feel prepared.

2. **During-Event Circumstances**
   - Networking feels unstructured or random—connections occur coincidentally rather than intentionally.
   - Attendees hesitate to approach panelists or presenters due to perceived barriers.
   - Connections are harder to foster due to the diversity of attendees’ goals and backgrounds.
   - Missing sessions or conversations feels inevitable, but there’s no clear “in-the-moment” solution to compensate.

3. **Post-Event Circumstances**
   - Attendees reflect alone or within small trusted circles, missing collective perspectives.
   - Insights or opportunities from missed sessions are often abandoned rather than revisited.
   - Sustaining momentum and applying event learnings to daily life requires personal effort.
   - Attendees seek additional learning pathways (e.g., resources, discussions) but lack direction or community-driven support.

---

## **General Hacks or Behaviors as Competitors**
Sometimes, the “competitors” aren’t platforms or tools but **workarounds** people create in daily life:

1. **Pre-Event Hacks**
   - Attendees manually curate lists of speakers or participants from social media.
   - People create group chats with colleagues or peers who are also attending.
   - Attendees pre-plan casual meetups with friends or past connections at the event venue.

2. **During-Event Hacks**
   - Attendees “shadow” someone with similar goals, using them to discover good sessions or people.
   - Individuals share session notes through impromptu group chats (e.g., Telegram).
   - Attendees skip panel Q&As to approach speakers informally during breaks.

3. **Post-Event Hacks**
   - Attendees follow presenters on social media to engage with their reflections.
   - Small circles of attendees exchange notes, links, and resources via email or messaging apps.
   - People use tools like Notion to summarize and archive personal takeaways for later use.

## **Key Takeaways**
Each persona approaches event experiences differently, and the tools, services, and habits they value reflect their goals and needs:

- **Tech Novices**: Want approachable content, simple guides, and small, casual spaces for networking.
- **AI Practitioners**: Seek focused, technical spaces and practical resources for post-event application.
- **Mentors/Thought Leaders**: Value philosophical discussions, opportunities to mentor others, and post-event sharing tools.
- **Consultants**: Thrive on social opportunities and practical takeaways to build relationships and strategies.

By analyzing competitors based on these **circumstances and personas**, you’ll uncover gaps in existing solutions and opportunities for differentiation across audience-specific needs.

## You (2024-12-16T14:34:32.696455+00:00)

I think i got off track a bit... Ok, Here's what we discussed before


Similar Goals
Definition: What does the product aim to achieve? Goals reflect the overarching intent or purpose behind a competitor's offering.

Similar Audience
Definition: Who is using the product? This aspect identifies overlapping demographic, psychographic, or behavioral traits of users.

Similar Circumstances
Definition: Under what context or situation is the product used? Circumstances include timing, location, and external factors influencing product use.

 Similar Enablers
Definition: What technologies, systems, or infrastructures make the product work? Enablers are the underlying mechanisms that support functionality.

----

IMO, we can skip 'Similar Enablers' cuz if we're looking for competitors by audience, circumstances, and goals - those competitors would be enablers. Whether its a complex tech solution, a small hack, or personal habit.

For our goals, and circumstances, let me re-iterate the opportunities we discussed earlier.

1. Creating networking experiences that don’t feel transactional or professional in the traditional sense. This was based on the observation that Domain Specific events are seen as more effective for pursuing professional relationships.

For Example

Perspective Pairing Spaces:
Where Illyza and Stacy could connect via their shared perspective on entry level job hiring.

Unconference Spaces:
Where Kelly and Monique could connect on their shared critique on presenters and panelists, and possibly help each other.

Contrasting Viewpoints:
Where Nami can discover people in the pursuit of finding different perspectives on the same topic.


2. Encourage collaborative recap discussions or peer driven analysis. This could work with a combination of bite-sized summaries, opinions, peer commentary, or opportunities for asynchronous discussions. This was based on the observation that Missed sessions are a regret, but attendees are unlikely to revisit them without added value, context, or a sense of engagement.

3. Pre-event networking activities could potentially build anticipation and take some of the pressure away from the event schedule. Today, this happens through slack channels and shared docs that have attendee details. This was based on the observation that Many thought networking was limited by the schedule, but most praised the event's flawless execution, with some noting that networking can take time to cultivate.

4. Help by providing clearer “choose-your-own-path” in the form of discussions, tailored courses, and specific articles and references. This was based on the observation that Those who want to execute on ideas, first take a step back and do some independent research from reputable sources before moving forward with a strategy or outreach.

-----

Now what I'd like you to do is use this information to form Goals and Circumstances based on the framework we previously discussed. ButI'd like you to do it per persona, along with providing current solutions, whether this is a current app, website, platform, tool, hack, trick, personal habit, whatever it might be. The more solutions the better. Keep it in a tabular format so its easy for me to read. One table per persona.

Sry, just to clarify, I want you to use my opportunities as inspiration for goals and circumstances for each persona. Not the 'what they do', 'what they want', and 'what excites them'. The three I just mentioned are for you to empathize with a person so you can understand their situation and personality.

## ChatGPT (2024-12-16T14:38:22.008590+00:00)

Got it! I’ll use **your opportunities** as the foundation to frame the **Goals** and **Circumstances** for each persona. I’ll avoid reiterating their “what they do,” “what they want,” and “what excites them,” using those only to empathize with their context.

The opportunities we’re using as a base are:
1. **Creating non-transactional networking experiences.**
2. **Encouraging collaborative recap discussions or peer-driven analysis.**
3. **Pre-event networking activities to build anticipation.**
4. **Helping attendees choose their own learning path through discussions, tailored content, and references.**

## **Summary of Approach**
For each persona, I’ve:
- Used **your opportunities** as inspiration for clear, persona-specific **Goals** and **Circumstances**.
- Provided actionable **Current Solutions** to address those circumstances—ranging from platforms, spaces, tools, and personal habits.

These tables can help identify **potential competitors** (both digital and physical), as well as gaps where new opportunities can emerge. Let me know if you'd like deeper exploration into any specific area!

## You (2024-12-16T14:43:18.425767+00:00)

Under 'Current Solutions,' could you give me examples of real-life solutions? Most of the solutions here are superficial. I need tangible examples, both tech and non-tech (or personal habit) solutions.

And a few more things you should know about the personas.

What we observed with the tech novice business owners is they often first take a step back after the event, do their own research, and then try to seek industry professionals that can help them act on any actionable insights or inspirations.

With AI Practitioners, we saw that with events like ours their main goal is to get an understanding of how business execs, teams, and leaders view AI.

One thing we saw in every case was that ChatGPT became their first source of inspiration which helps them get pointed in the right direction. People also seek information only from trusted sources. Here're some additional observations that might help you.

I’m breaking down our observations into three spaces.


- Interviewee's opinion on content and presenters
- Interviewee's approach to networking
- Interviewee’s approach to self-education and problem-solving.
Content and Panelists
Content:
- None of the participants we interviewed joined the D^3ed conference with a specific agenda that is centered around the implementation and applications of AI within organizations.
- Some participants who were well versed in AI did state their desire to understand how leaders from different companies view the impact of AI.
- From the POV of experts in AI, the content fell into a balanced middle ground, where it was neither too technical nor too speculative or forward-thinking.
- From the POV of participants not too deep in AI, the conference acted as an introduction to the possibilities of AI, after which they wanted to learn more about applications of AI within their domain.

Interviewees expected the event to be a source of inspiration to either learn about a broad range of AI application. The sentiment was shared by both experts and novices in the field of AI. Given that some wanted variety, and others wanted depth, the event can be seen as a neutral middle ground, allowing attendees to choose their own path moving forward.


Panelists and Presenters:
- AI professionals mentioned a desire to talk to presenters; however, they expressed discomfort because they saw the presenters as celebrities.
- Participants who focus on mentoring startups felt that insights from representatives of large enterprises offered very little actionable information for small businesses.
- Investors with a strong technical background who diligently followed new research in AI had a neutral opinion of the presenters.
- Every participant mentioned Ethan Mollick’s presentation to be the most valuable for their time.


Staying engaged with missed content:
- Not being able to attend a presentation or workshop was seen as a missed opportunity, but given the wealth of content available today, the missed opportunity was not seen as worth pursuing once again.
- Some participants saw value in staying engaged with a forum (or get different attendees’ take) about missed presentations or workshops.


Approach to Networking
- While networking was mentioned as one of the objectives for attending the event, the general sentiment appeared to be relaxed and casual, where making connections was welcomed but not actively pursued with urgency or intensity.
- Whether the lack of networking was due to a lack of opportunity to network, or due to a rather wide variety of people (leaving attendees with few options to meet people with similar backgrounds) cannot be clearly determined from the interviews alone.
- Most participants believed that domain-specific events are more fruitful for pursuing professional relationships.


Self Education and Problem Solving
- The most common theme among participants was the emergence of ChatGPT as the initial source of addressing ambiguities and learning new concepts.
- Investors with advanced knowledge of AI mentioned subscribing to research papers to learn about new trends and advancements.
- Business Owners and investors wanted to talk to trusted experts within their circle for more information.
- 1 person mentioned learning about AI through books.

Got it! Based on these additional observations and the opportunities you outlined earlier, I’ve updated the **Goals**, **Circumstances**, and **Current Solutions** for each persona.

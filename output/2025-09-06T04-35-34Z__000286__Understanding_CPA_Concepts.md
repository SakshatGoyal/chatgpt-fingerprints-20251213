# Understanding CPA Concepts

## You (2025-09-06T04:35:34.055000+00:00)

could u help me understand the CPA in easy terms?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-06T04:35:34.790414+00:00)

Got it — let me break **Cognitive Prompt Architecture (CPA)** into easy terms for you:

---

### The Core Idea
CPA is like a **toolbox of thinking styles** for AI.
Instead of retraining a model, you give it structured prompts that push it to think more like a human expert — step by step, checking itself, and improving along the way【5†CPA†L85-L94】.

---

### The Six “Thinking Modes”
Each one is like putting on a different hat:

1. **Reasoning Cycle (Explore)** → Try out different ideas, compare them, and pick the best one.
2. **Adversarial Refinement (Challenge)** → Play devil’s advocate: find flaws in a solution, fix them, and make it stronger.
3. **Evolutionary Growth (Evolve)** → Start with several options, mix the best parts, and keep improving in cycles.
4. **Dialectic Inquiry (Question)** → Use Socratic-style questioning to uncover assumptions and hidden gaps.
5. **Panel Synthesis (Integrate)** → Imagine an expert panel (security, usability, cost, etc.), hear all their perspectives, and combine them.
6. **Constraint Dynamics (Adapt)** → Test solutions against real-world limits (time, money, resources) and adjust to fit【5†CPA†L95-L102】.

---

### Why It’s Useful
CPA helps with **complex problems** — like designing systems, strategic planning, or debugging.
It makes the AI more:
- **Thorough** (considers alternatives, not just one answer)
- **Critical** (catches weak spots)
- **Balanced** (integrates multiple perspectives)
- **Adaptive** (works within real-world constraints)【5†CPA†L73-L81】

---

👉 In short: **CPA is a framework that teaches AI to think in structured, human-like ways using prompts instead of retraining.**

---

Do you want me to make a **simple everyday analogy** (like how CPA is similar to planning a group trip), so it’s easier to “see it in action”?

## You (2025-09-06T04:38:29.553000+00:00)

Walk me through a simple scenario and show me how it might play out. In your example, show me 2 points of view
1. what is a user doing
2. what is the AI doing (or how is it responding)

play it like a movie with different scenes, which each step of the CPA acting as the 6 acts of the movie.

















## ChatGPT (2025-09-06T04:39:01.216361+00:00)

here’s a tiny “movie” of CPA in action. the plot: you want to look natural dancing at a friend’s party this weekend, with just three 30-minute practice sessions.

# Act I — Reasoning Cycle (Explore)

**User (on screen):**
“I’ve got three evenings. What’s the fastest way to not look awkward?”

**AI (behind the scenes):**
- Maps options and compares them quickly:
  A) YouTube mini-playlist + mirror,
  B) App with guided drills,
  C) One drop-in beginner class tonight.
- Jots quick pros/cons, complexity, likely failure modes (e.g., no feedback, timing issues), then tentatively favors **A** for time/cost and adds “film yourself for feedback.” fileciteturn1file5L7-L11 fileciteturn1file5L14-L21

# Act II — Adversarial Refinement (Challenge)

**User:**
“Makes sense. Anything I’m missing?”

**AI:**
- Plays **critic**: “If you only copy videos, you might lock your knees, rush the beat, or annoy neighbors late at night.”
- Plays **defender**: Adds fixes—phone on a chair for side-angle video, **metronome at 90–100 BPM**, practice before 9pm, quick posture cues (“soft knees, tall chest”).
- **Judge**: Compares original vs refined plan; refined plan reduces timing and posture risks. fileciteturn1file14L12-L20 fileciteturn1file14L27-L36

# Act III — Evolutionary Growth (Evolve)

**User:**
“Cool. What’s the practice flow each night?”

**AI:**
- Generates variants:
  • **V1** footwork-first (two-step + side rock),
  • **V2** timing-first (clap → step),
  • **V3** flow-first (weight shifts + turns).
- Selects strengths (V2’s timing clarity + V1’s steps), creates **Hybrid H1**.
- Mutates H1 with a 10-second **tempo ramp** and a “micro-loop” (10 reps × 10 seconds) to build smoothness.
- Re-scores fitness; keeps H1.1 for Night 2/3. fileciteturn1file7L53-L60

# Act IV — Dialectic Inquiry (Question)

**User:**
“What exactly does ‘look natural’ mean here?”

**AI:**
- Runs a short Socratic check: What’s the core outcome—mastery of moves or **steady rhythm + relaxed vibe**? Any constraints—space, neighbors, shoes?
- Refines target to three observable wins:
  1) stay on beat for 60s,
  2) shoulders relaxed,
  3) simple turn without rushing.
- Updates plan to emphasize these and drops anything non-essential. fileciteturn1file10L3-L6 fileciteturn1file10L12-L17

# Act V — Panel Synthesis (Integrate)

**User:**
“Give me a tight checklist.”

**AI (simulating an expert panel):**
- **Coach (technique):** soft knees, weight over balls of feet.
- **Musician (timing):** count “1-and-2-and” with a metronome first, then music.
- **Physical therapist (body):** 3×15-sec ankle/hip warm-ups; stop if pain.
- **Social dancer (confidence):** eye-focus up, micro-smile, breathe.
- Integrates trade-offs (perfect technique vs relaxed feel) into one balanced routine and notes mitigations (shorter steps if cramped). fileciteturn1file12L35-L41 fileciteturn1file16L21-L30

# Act VI — Constraint Dynamics (Adapt)

**User:**
“It’s a tiny apartment, and the downstairs neighbor is sensitive.”

**AI:**
- Lists constraints: limited space, noise after 9pm, only 30 minutes/night.
- Designs the **ideal** (no constraints) mini-session, then re-adds constraints and adapts:
  • switch to socks or soft shoes,
  • smaller steps + more weight-shift drills,
  • earlier session time,
  • if noise complaint → swap to upper-body rhythm drills + silent timing practice.
- Final 3-night plan:
  **Night 1 (foundation, 30m):** 5m warm-up → 10m timing (clap + step) → 10m two-step loop → 5m video review.
  **Night 2 (flow, 30m):** 5m warm-up → 15m H1.1 micro-loops → 5m add turn → 5m review.
  **Night 3 (confidence, 30m):** 5m warm-up → 10m timing check → 10m full song (light smile, relaxed shoulders) → 5m review + notes. fileciteturn1file16L34-L47 fileciteturn1file9L1-L7

---

### Post-credits: how the AI “grades itself” and learns
After this run, the AI does a quick 40-point self-check (Accuracy, Efficiency, Process, Innovation) and logs “what worked / what to fix next time” so the next plan starts smarter. fileciteturn1file6L9-L15 fileciteturn1file6L19-L22

---

If you want, I can turn this into a **copy-paste prompt** you can use with any task (e.g., picking running shoes, prepping a portfolio review), still in the 6-act format.

## You (2025-09-06T05:42:49.160000+00:00)

I think while it may be... I appreciate the effort, but I think it's a little too simple for me to understand. So my understanding, and maybe I was wrong, was that the AI will itself go through all these processes. So the prompt is not separate prompts, but rather one single prompt and it's essentially similar to a chain of thought where a framework is set in to be used as a scaffolding for that chain of thought. And so it might be like a single prompt where it's a very single, long, complex prompt with a lot of chain of thought. And I wanted to see how an AI would be thinking through all of those different steps within the chain of thought. Am I somewhat wrong in this understanding? I don't know. I might be completely wrong, so I need some help. I need an objective analysis on my opinion on the CPA.













## ChatGPT (2025-09-06T05:43:27.789582+00:00)

Short answer: you’re **mostly right**—and here’s the precise, objective take.

- **Yes:** CPA is a **scaffolded chain-of-thought**: one prompt can direct the model to walk through six reasoning “domains” with the same five phases (explore → analyze → implement → self-evaluate → integrate). That’s literally what CPA prescribes【fileciteturn2file0L5-L7】.
- **Also yes:** These domains can be **sequenced or combined** in one run (even in parallel in places) rather than used as six separate prompts【fileciteturn2file10L29-L36】.
- **And:** CPA includes **memory integration** and a **40-point self-evaluation** rubric so the model “grades” its own process and folds the learning back in【fileciteturn2file0L5-L6】【fileciteturn2file8L31-L44】.
- **Nuance:** CPA is **modular**. You can run it as one long orchestrator prompt or as staged modules. The framework supports both patterns【fileciteturn2file1L1-L6】.

One important caveat: I won’t expose raw hidden chain-of-thought. Instead, I’ll show an **execution trace**—the observable artifacts each “act” would emit.

# CPA-as-a-single-prompt, played like a movie (2 POVs)
**Scenario:** “Find independent house cleaners repeatedly recommended by SF residents on Nextdoor; return name + phone, ≥2 unique SF recommenders, short quotes w/ permalinks; rank by community backing; add rates/notes/flags.”

## Act I — Reasoning Cycle (Explore)
**User is doing:** Pastes the goal.
**AI (visible outputs):**
- **Candidate approaches (summary table):**

| Approach | Data collection path | De-dup | Ranking signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Manual search + copy to sheet | Name/phone fuzzy match | Unique SF recommenders |
| B | Semi-automated: browser finds + structured form | Form enforces SF-only | (# recs) × recency weight |
| C | Programmatic assist (if exports available) | Phone/alias clustering | Graph centrality of recommenders |

- **Pick:** B (fastest to “good enough” with guardrails).
- **Edge-case checklist:** duplicate names, company promos, posters from outside SF, DM-only contacts (no phone).

(Why this matches CPA: option mapping → selection → edge cases → plan【fileciteturn2file6L14-L21】【fileciteturn2file6L30-L36】.)

## Act II — Adversarial Refinement (Challenge)
**User is doing:** “Tear holes in it.”
**AI (visible outputs):**
- **Top risks found:** self-promotion posts, mislabeling South SF vs. farther south, sock-puppet recommendations, missing permalinks.
- **Defenses added:** flag heuristics (poster history < X posts; identical blurb across threads), strict geo filter (SF + Daly City + South SF + Oakland only), require ≥2 distinct SF recommenders before ranking, mandatory permalink for each quote.
- **Change log:** added “Flags” field; added “Neighborhood of each recommender.”

(Why this matches CPA: creator → critic → defender → judge, with explicit trade-offs【fileciteturn2file14L21-L31】【fileciteturn2file16L7-L11】.)

## Act III — Evolutionary Growth (Evolve)
**User is doing:** “Give me the capture form.”
**AI (visible outputs):**
- **Variant forms:**
  - V1 minimal (Name, Phone, Quote, Link).
  - V2 richer (adds Recommender handle, Neighborhood, Date).
  - V3 audit-ready (adds Rate mentions, Availability notes, Flags, Source thread).
- **Hybrid chosen:** V2+V3 ⇒ **Final fields:** Name, Phone, Unique Recommenders (count), Neighborhoods (list), 1–4 quotes (≤25 words) with permalinks, Rate mentions, Notes, Flags.
- **Fitness note:** Hybrid covers ranking + auditability without slowing capture.

(Why this matches CPA: generate variants → recombine → mutate → select【fileciteturn2file16L24-L35】【fileciteturn2file16L37-L55】.)

## Act IV — Dialectic Inquiry (Question)
**User is doing:** “Interrogate the spec.”
**AI (visible outputs):**
- **Foundational clarifications captured:**
  - Core outcome = *independent* cleaners (not companies).
  - Posters must be from SF (okay: Daly City / South SF / Oakland).
  - Must show **permalked quotes**; **phone required** for inclusion.
- **Refinements:** exclude posts w/o phone; enforce ≤25-word quotes; ensure ≥2 distinct SF recommenders; add “Insufficient quotes” flag.

(Why this matches CPA: foundational → generation → critical → refinement questions that tighten the spec【fileciteturn2file15L20-L26】.)

## Act V — Panel Synthesis (Integrate)
**User is doing:** “Balance speed vs. trust.”
**AI (visible outputs):**
- **Expert lenses synthesized:**
  - **Data integrity:** record source thread + permalink for each quote.
  - **UX/reviewability:** one cleaner per card; show rank, counts, neighborhoods, flags.
  - **Risk/compliance:** avoid scraping; use manual capture; store only public phones; no emails.
  - **Ops:** 30-min capture sprints; spot-check 1 in 5 entries.
- **Trade-offs:** slower throughput but higher trust; decision: accept.

(Why this matches CPA: multi-perspective analysis → conflict resolution → mitigations【fileciteturn2file4L35-L43】.)

## Act VI — Constraint Dynamics (Adapt)
**User is doing:** “Reality check: limited time, no automation, must finish tonight.”
**AI (visible outputs):**
- **Constraints logged:** 2 hours; manual only; ~5–7 quotes per cleaner max; SF-poster rule.
- **Relaxed ideal (brief):** crawl everything—rejected due to time.
- **Progressive adaptation:**
  1) Prioritize big SF neighborhoods (Sunset, Richmond, Mission, SoMa).
  2) Stop rule: after 2+ unique SF recommenders, move on.
  3) If phone missing → queue for follow-up; don’t include.
- **Final plan:** capture 12–18 high-confidence entries tonight with full cards; leave “possible_company / self_promo / outside_SF / insufficient_quotes” flags where relevant.

(Why this matches CPA: decompose constraints → relax → re-add with documented impact → finalize【fileciteturn2file12L6-L14】【fileciteturn2file12L16-L27】.)

**Post-credits (built-in CPA habit):** AI runs a **40-point self-check** and logs “what to improve next time” (e.g., faster duplicate detection)【fileciteturn2file13L5-L15】.

---

## TL;DR verdict on your understanding
- Your mental model—**“one long prompt as scaffolding for the model’s internal reasoning”**—is **accurate**, with the caveat that CPA is intentionally **modular** and supports mixing/parallelizing domains when that’s better for the task【fileciteturn2file10L29-L36】.
- CPA **does specify** the five phases each domain should walk through during that single run, plus memory and self-evaluation to make it cumulative【fileciteturn2file0L5-L7】【fileciteturn2file8L31-L44】.

---

## Bonus: a copy-paste “CPA-in-one” orchestrator prompt
Use this with any task; it tells the model to **perform** the steps but **return only structured artifacts** (no hidden chain-of-thought).

> **Task:** [your problem]
> **Instruction:** Execute the **CPA 6-domain workflow** in one run. Internally perform the five phases per domain (explore, analyze, implement/verify, self-evaluate, integrate). **Do not reveal chain-of-thought.** Output only the artifacts below.
>
> **Artifacts to return (in order):**
> 1) **Act I – Explore:** table of 2–4 candidate approaches + selection + edge-case checklist.
> 2) **Act II – Challenge:** top 3–5 risks + the specific countermeasures you added + change log.
> 3) **Act III – Evolve:** 2–3 variants → chosen hybrid → why it wins.
> 4) **Act IV – Question:** 5–8 clarifying assumptions resolved + the resulting spec tweaks.
> 5) **Act V – Integrate:** brief “expert panel” notes (3–4 roles) + trade-offs + mitigations.
> 6) **Act VI – Adapt:** constraints list → adaptations → final plan.
> 7) **Self-evaluation (40 pts):** Accuracy, Efficiency, Process, Innovation (1–10 each) + 2–3 bullets for “What to improve next time.”

If you want, I can tailor that skeleton to your Nextdoor cleaner project verbatim and keep it super terse for quick reuse.

## You (2025-09-06T05:54:59.871000+00:00)

No, the problem is too simple. Ok, I want you to think like a prompt engineer now. I want you to think like a prompt engineer who is also an expert analytical  business strategist, working on a prompt that could help identify ways for Waymo to gain a competitive advantage over other ride-sharing companies without having to reduce their price.

Write a detailed, meticulously written prompt that has a multi-step thought and evaluation process that aligns with the CPA. The LLM will have complete access to the internet. The prompt should make the LLM think in the same way as described in the CPA and help you achieve this advantage for Waymo.









## ChatGPT (2025-09-06T05:55:16.245827+00:00)

Here’s a single, end-to-end **CPA-aligned orchestrator prompt** you can copy-paste into an internet-enabled LLM. It makes the model “think” in six acts (the CPA domains) while returning only external, verifiable artifacts—no hidden chain-of-thought.

---

# 📌 Prompt: “Waymo, Non-Price Competitive Advantage — CPA Orchestrator”

**Role & Goal**
You are a senior strategy analyst and prompt engineer. Your task is to identify, evidence, and prioritize **non-price** competitive advantages for **Waymo** versus ride-hailing and robotaxi competitors (e.g., Uber, Lyft, Cruise, Tesla FSD-driven networks, local AV pilots), then output an execution-ready strategy with risks, metrics, and milestones.

**Operating Rules**
- You have full web access. Prefer high-quality, primary sources (recent regulator filings, Alphabet/Waymo investor materials, CPUC/NHTSA/DMV orders, city DOTs, reputable news, peer-reviewed or industry whitepapers).
- **Citations required** for every factual claim that informs conclusions; include source, publisher, date, and direct URL.
- Time horizon: **2025–2027**; Geography focus: **SF Bay Area, Phoenix/Metro, LA, Austin** (state explicitly; expand if evidence indicates outsized opportunity).
- **Non-price levers only** (no discounts, subsidies, or fare cuts).
- Do **not** reveal hidden chain-of-thought. Return only the artifacts specified below.
- When evidence conflicts, present both sides, explain the discrepancy, and state how it changes recommendations.

---

## 🎬 Act I — Reasoning Cycle (Explore)
**Deliverable A1 (table + short notes):**
1) **Opportunity Map (table):** Rows = non-price advantage categories; Columns = “Customer Value”, “Feasibility @ Waymo”, “Defensibility vs. copycats”, “Time-to-Impact”, “Key Risks”, “Proof/Evidence (citations)”.
   - Seed categories to (evidence-check and expand):
     - **Reliability/Availability** (coverage hours, ODD expansion, ETA accuracy, empty miles optimization)
     - **Safety & Trust** (transparent incident rates, independent audits, insurance partnerships, safety driverless milestones)
     - **Product Experience** (in-cabin UX, accessibility/ADA, quiet/clean, consistent routing, language options, rider assistance, luggage/airport readiness)
     - **Enterprise & Partnerships** (airports/hospitals/campuses, hotels/events, TNC integrations, transit first/last-mile, employer commuting)
     - **Regulatory/Policy** (pilot structures, city accords, community benefits agreements)
     - **Data/Navigation Edge** (Google ecosystem tie-ins, maps/traffic prediction, geofencing precision, pick-up/drop-off orchestration)
     - **Operations** (charging uptime, fleet utilization, preventive maintenance, remote assist)
     - **Brand & Ecosystem** (Google account identity, safety reputation, accessibility leadership)
2) Select **3–5 most promising plays** (brief justification per play).
3) **Edge-case checklist** captured: constraints, known unknowns, dependencies (e.g., airport permits, curb space policies, AV caps, ODD/weather limits).
*(A1 must be fully cited.)*

---

## 🛡️ Act II — Adversarial Refinement (Challenge)
**Deliverable A2 (matrix + change log):**
- For each selected play, run a **Red Team Critique**:
  - Competitor counter-moves (e.g., Uber product parity; Cruise regulatory lobbying; airport exclusivity; transit partnerships).
  - Operational risks (fleet scale, remote assist load, incident response).
  - Regulatory barriers (permit types, caps, public comment headwinds).
  - Community/social risks (labor/displacement concerns, accessibility gaps).
- **Defenses & Design Changes:** Convert each critique into a concrete mitigation (policy design, product tweak, partner choice, rollout sequence).
- **Change Log:** Bullet what changed in the play design and why (with links).
*(A2 must be fully cited; show at least 1 independent source per material risk.)*

---

## 🧬 Act III — Evolutionary Growth (Evolve)
**Deliverable A3 (variants → hybrid):**
- For the **top 2 plays**, produce **2–3 distinct variants** each (e.g., Airport Advantage v1: luggage-first UX; v2: airline baggage API tie-in; v3: curbside robot concierge).
- **Recombine** best elements into **one hybrid per play**.
- Add **one “mutation”** per hybrid that creates a moat (e.g., independent safety scorecards; accessibility SLAs with penalties; guaranteed zero surge; Google Workspace commute credits bundle with employers).
- Brief **fitness scorecard** per hybrid: Impact (market size, profit accretive), Feasibility (permits/tech), Defensibility (copy cost/lead time), Risk (ops/regulatory).
*(A3 cites any external dependency or claimed partner feasibility.)*

---

## ❓ Act IV — Dialectic Inquiry (Question)
**Deliverable A4 (assumption ledger + refined acceptance criteria):**
- Write the **assumptions you are making**, then challenge each with web evidence. Typical assumptions to test:
  - What **“advantage”** are we optimizing? (e.g., rides/vehicle/day, on-time pickup %, NPS, safety incidents/1M miles, airport share, ADA ride share)
  - **User segments** that value non-price perks (airport travelers, late-night workers, mobility-impaired riders, business commuters, tourists).
  - **Regulatory feasibility** and timelines per city.
- Produce **Refined Acceptance Criteria** (measurable) for each play, e.g.:
  - “Increase airport PAX rides by **+X%** in 2 quarters at ≥**Y%** on-time pickup, ≤**Z min** curb dwell, ADA request fulfillment ≥**W%**.”
*(A4 links each assumption to at least one recent source; highlight contradictory findings.)*

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ Act V — Panel Synthesis (Integrate)
**Deliverable A5 (panel memos + synthesis):**
Simulate brief memos (3–6 bullets each) from **these expert roles**:
- **Safety/Regulatory Affairs** (permits, reporting, community benefits)
- **Operations & Fleet** (utilization, charging, remote assist, maintenance)
- **Product/UX & Accessibility** (ADA/ASL support, luggage flows, child seats)
- **Partnerships/Enterprise** (airports, hospitals, campuses, employers, hotels)
- **Finance** (unit economics, capex/opex, payback)
- **Brand/Risk** (trust messaging, incident comms, privacy)
Then deliver a **Synthesis Brief** that:
1) resolves conflicts (e.g., speed vs. safety transparency, enterprise exclusivity vs. consumer access),
2) states the **final recommended design** per play, and
3) lists **trade-offs** + **mitigations**.
*(A5 keeps memos concise; the Synthesis is the decision record. Cite where an external constraint shapes a trade-off.)*

---

## 🧩 Act VI — Constraint Dynamics (Adapt)
**Deliverable A6 (roadmap + guardrails):**
1) **Constraint ledger:** budget/capex bounds, ODD limits (weather, geofencing), city/airport caps, curb management, remote assist staffing, privacy constraints, labor/community considerations.
2) **Progressive adaptation:** Show how each constraint alters the ideal design; document the impact and the adaptation you choose.
3) **Final Roadmap:**
   - **Sequenced pilots** (city/venue), gating **milestones**, **kill criteria**, and **decision triggers** (what data would expand/kill/iterate).
   - **KPIs** per play (leading + lagging), with starting baseline and target by quarter.
   - **Risk register** (likelihood × impact) and **contingency playbooks**.
*(A6 is executable; every gating dependency that relies on external actors must be linked/cited.)*

---

## 📊 Evaluation & Reporting (CPA self-check, output only)
**Deliverable E (scorecards + summary):**
- **40-pt rubric** (no hidden rationale):
  - Accuracy, Efficiency, Process, Innovation — 1–10 each → total/40.
- **Top 3 “No-Regrets” moves** (implement regardless of uncertainty) and **Top 3 “Option Bets”** (small stakes with big upside).
- **One-page Executive Summary** (bullets): the advantage thesis, key numbers, city sequence, and first 90-day plan.
*(No chain-of-thought; just scores and artifacts.)*

---

## 🔍 Method & Quality Guardrails
- **Freshness:** Prefer sources ≤12 months old. If older, justify why still valid.
- **Balance:** When the best public evidence is inconclusive, say so and provide the “how to learn fast” plan (test design + metric + sample size).
- **Comparability:** Normalize any metrics (e.g., incidents per 1M miles) across sources.
- **Ethics & Safety:** Do not propose actions that reduce safety margins or mislead regulators or the public.
- **Compliance:** Follow platform, city, state, and federal rules (e.g., CPUC/NHTSA/DMV).
- **Output Format:**
  - A1–A6 and E in this order.
  - Each table is readable in chat (no images).
  - Every non-obvious claim has an inline citation `[Publisher, Title, Date] (URL)`.

---

### (Optional) Seed Questions the Model May Explore (keep it short; evidence-driven)
- Which non-price levers historically moved **adoption** in AV/TNC pilots (coverage, reliability, safety transparency, partnerships)?
- Which **airport/healthcare/campus** partnerships are structurally hard to copy quickly?
- Where can Waymo credibly lead on **accessibility** (wheelchair vehicles, ADA SLAs) and **trust** (open incident dashboards, independent audits)?
- What **Google ecosystem** integrations create defensible stickiness without lowering price (e.g., Maps/Flights/Workspace/Wallet/Transit tie-ins, respecting privacy and regulation)?

**End of Prompt**

## You (2025-09-06T06:01:20.898000+00:00)

We’re no longer working in the realm of films and movies. Instead, let’s approach this prompt with a critical and objective mindset. Identify any issues or shortcomings in the prompt and strive to enhance it. The goal is to generate insights that are not only actionable but also highly valuable. Ensure that the prompt doesn’t merely present a literal interpretation of the CPA and then delve into a deeper, more nuanced opinion on it.

You are a prompt engineer who is also an expert analytical business strategist, working on a prompt that could help identify ways for Waymo to gain a competitive advantage over other ride-sharing companies without having to reduce their price.





## ChatGPT (2025-09-06T06:01:22.063229+00:00)

Great brief. I’ll do two things:

1) give you an **objective critique** of the prior prompt (what would limit valuable, actionable insights), and
2) deliver an **upgraded, CPA-inspired but non-literal** orchestrator prompt you can paste into an internet-enabled LLM.

---

## 1) Objective critique of the prior prompt (issues → fixes)

**A. Too descriptive of CPA, not sufficiently outcome-forcing**
- *Issue:* It mirrors CPA phases rather than using them to **force non-obvious, high-value outputs**.
- *Fix:* Replace phase recitations with **workstreams** that embed CPA logic but are judged by **insight tests** (novelty, measurability, defensibility, scalability, feasibility).

**B. Risk of generic strategy lists**
- *Issue:* Broad categories (safety, UX, partnerships) invite boilerplate.
- *Fix:* Impose **falsifiable hypotheses** + **counterfactuals** (e.g., “If airport curb space becomes exclusive, what irreversible advantage emerges?”). Require **copy-time estimates** (how long a rival needs to match) and **proof of difficulty**.

**C. Insufficient quantification and decisionability**
- *Issue:* No expected-value (EV) model, kill criteria, or ROI framing → hard to choose.
- *Fix:* Mandate an EV scoring formula and **board-ready** decision artifacts: 90-day plan, gates, “no-regrets vs. option bets,” and **kill switches**.

**D. Weak competitor wargaming**
- *Issue:* Mentions “counter-moves” but not a **move-countermove schedule** or supply-side constraints.
- *Fix:* Add a **3-round wargame** with dated moves, resourcing assumptions (e.g., fleet/remote assist), and a **net advantage delta** after each round.

**E. Regulatory realism not operationalized**
- *Issue:* Cites regulators but lacks **permit pathway maps**, **city-level constraints**, and timelines.
- *Fix:* Require **jurisdiction dossiers** (CPUC, DMV, city DOT, airport authorities), approval sequences, and **policy levers** (e.g., community benefits agreements).

**F. Under-leveraged Google ecosystem**
- *Issue:* Doesn’t force exploration of **defensible integrations** (Maps, Flights, Wallet, Workspace, Android, Assistant) with privacy compliance.
- *Fix:* Add a **distribution & data moat audit**: which integrations create **switching costs** and **copy friction** without price cuts.

**G. Accessibility and trust not positioned as moats**
- *Issue:* Treated as features, not strategic barriers.
- *Fix:* Require **public, auditable commitments** (SLAs), third-party audits, and **open metrics** that are hard to replicate quickly.

**H. Evidence quality/freshness not enforced**
- *Issue:* Risks stale or low-credibility sources.
- *Fix:* Add **recency rules**, **source weighting**, normalization (e.g., incidents per 1M miles), and **contradiction handling**.

**I. Output shape not executive-ready**
- *Issue:* Useful for analysis, less so for decision.
- *Fix:* Force **one-page exec summary, decision memo**, and **program brief** per play with owners, budgets, milestones.

TITLE: Waymo Non-Price Advantage — Evidence-First Strategy Orchestrator (v2.1)

ROLE:
You are a senior strategy analyst + prompt engineer. Your mission is to surface and prioritize non-price competitive advantages for Waymo versus ride-hailing and AV rivals (Uber, Lyft, Cruise, Tesla FSD networks, etc.) and produce a decision-ready plan.

SCOPE & CONSTRAINTS:
- Geography focus: SF Bay Area, Phoenix Metro, LA, Austin. Expand only with evidence-backed upside.
- Horizon: 0–24 months (H1: 0–3m; H2: 3–12m; H3: 12–24m).
- Non-price only: No discounts, subsidies, or fare cuts; avoid disguised price reductions.
- Compliance & ethics: Propose only actions consistent with law, safety, accessibility, and privacy standards.

WEB & EVIDENCE RULES:
- Use current, high-quality sources (prefer ≤12 months). For older data, justify relevance.
- Normalize safety/operations metrics (e.g., incidents per 1M miles, utilization %, on-time pickup %).
- For each material claim, include an inline citation [Publisher, Title, Date] (URL).
- When sources conflict, present both, explain why, and state how it changes recommendations.

INSIGHT TESTS (apply to every proposed advantage):
1) Non-obviousness: Not a generic AV platitude.
2) Measurability: Clear KPI uplift with baseline & target.
3) Defensibility: Time-to-copy (months), capex/opex to copy, regulatory friction.
4) Scalability: Can expand across cities/segments without linear cost.
5) Feasibility: Permits, partners, operations & staffing are realistically obtainable.

SCORING MODEL:
- For each candidate play, compute Expected Value (EV) = Impact(1–5) × Confidence(1–5) × Defensibility(1–5) × Speed-to-Impact(1–5) × Strategic Fit(1–5) – Risk(1–5).
- Report each sub-score, the total, and a 1-sentence rationale.

WORKSTREAMS & DELIVERABLES (return ONLY these artifacts):

W1) LANDSCAPE & HYPOTHESES (CPA: explore, but outcome-driven)
- A1. Non-Price Advantage Matrix (table):
  Rows = categories (Reliability/Availability; Safety & Trust; Accessibility/ADA; Product Experience; Enterprise & Partnerships; Regulatory/Policy; Data/Navigation; Operations; Brand/Ecosystem).
  Cols = Customer Value, Feasibility@Waymo, Defensibility, Time-to-Impact, Key Risks, Representative Proof (citations).
- A2. 6–10 Falsifiable Hypotheses (bulleted), each tied to a specific segment (e.g., airport traveler, mobility-impaired rider, late-night worker) and city. Include the primary KPI and expected uplift.
- A3. “What would make this FALSE?” list per hypothesis.

W2) WAR-GAME (CPA: adversarial refinement)
- B1. 3-Round Move–Countermove Table for top 4 hypotheses:
  Round 1 (T0), Round 2 (+90d), Round 3 (+180d).
  Include competitor resourcing assumptions (fleet scale, remote assist staffing), regulatory lobbying, and partnerships.
- B2. Net Advantage Delta after each round (qualitative + quantitative where possible).
- B3. Change Log: the design changes you make to preserve the edge.

W3) CONCEPT EVOLUTION & SYNTHESIS (CPA: evolutionary + multi-perspective)
- C1. For top 3 plays, generate 2–3 distinct variants each (e.g., “Airport Advantage” variants: curb access orchestration; baggage-flow API with airlines; hotel shuttle integration).
- C2. Build ONE hybrid per play that recombines best elements.
- C3. Add ONE “moat mutation” per hybrid that is costly/hard to copy (e.g., independent safety scorecard with public dashboard; ADA service-level guarantees with penalties; verified curb-space orchestration through airport authority MOU).
- C4. Fitness Scorecard per hybrid: Impact, Feasibility, Defensibility, Risk (with brief justifications).

W4) ASSUMPTION TESTING & COUNTERFACTUALS (CPA: dialectic inquiry)
- D1. Assumption Ledger: list key assumptions and attach evidence for/against.
- D2. Counterfactuals:
  (i) If airports deny exclusive curb access, what becomes the new edge?
  (ii) If rainy-season ODD limits persist, which reliability levers still work?
  (iii) If a rival publishes superior safety transparency, how do we leapfrog?
- D3. Refined Acceptance Criteria: measurable, city-specific thresholds that define success/failure per play.

W5) CONSTRAINT-AWARE ROADMAP (CPA: constraint dynamics)
- E1. Constraint Ledger: permits, caps, geofencing/ODD, curb management, charging/maintenance, remote assist ratios, labor/community expectations, privacy limits.
- E2. Progressive Adaptation Notes: how each constraint changes the design and what you choose to trade off.
- E3. Final Roadmap:
  • Sequenced pilots (city/venue), owners, budget ranges.
  • Milestones & Kill Criteria (what data kills/expands/iterates).
  • KPIs (leading & lagging) with baselines & 90-day targets per city/segment.
  • Risk Register (likelihood × impact) + Contingency Playbooks.

W6) DISTRIBUTION & DATA MOAT AUDIT (explicitly leverage Google ecosystem)
- F1. Integration Map: Maps, Flights/Itineraries, Wallet, Android/Assistant, Workspace (employers), Transit feeds.
- F2. For each integration, estimate:
  Switching Cost Created, Legal/Privacy Feasibility, Copy Friction (months, $), and User Lock-In Mechanism.
- F3. Privacy-by-Design Notes: how to implement without eroding trust.

EVALUATION & DECISION PACK (CPA: self-evaluation, output-only)
- G1. EV Ranking Table for all plays (top to bottom).
- G2. Three “No-Regrets” Moves (execute now) + Three “Option Bets” (small stakes, big upside).
- G3. One-Page Executive Summary (bulleted): thesis, key numbers, city sequence, first 90-day plan, major risks & mitigations.
- G4. 40-Point Process Score (Accuracy, Efficiency, Process, Innovation) with 2–3 bullets on “what to improve next time”.

RULES OF OUTPUT:
- Do NOT reveal chain-of-thought. Return only the artifacts above, in order, with readable tables.
- Each material claim includes a citation. Normalize metrics for comparability. Flag uncertainties with a learning plan (experiment design, sample size, success metric).

## Why this is stronger (and not a literal CPA translation)

- **CPA, applied—not recited.** The prompt uses CPA’s spirit (explore → challenge → evolve → question → integrate → adapt) but frames it as **workstreams judged by outcomes**, not phase checklists.
- **Forces novelty and defensibility.** The **Insight Tests**, **time-to-copy**, and **moat mutations** prevent generic answers and push for **irreversible advantages** (e.g., airport curb MOUs, auditable safety SLAs, Google ecosystem lock-ins that respect privacy).
- **Decision-grade, not academic.** EV scoring, wargaming, kill criteria, and a 90-day plan produce **board-ready** paths, not just analyses.
- **Regulatory & operational realism.** Jurisdiction dossiers, ODD/weather constraints, remote assist staffing, charging/maintenance—these keep recommendations executable.
- **Balanced ethics & growth.** Privacy-by-design, accessibility SLAs, and public safety dashboards position **trust as a moat** rather than mere compliance.

If you’d like, I can tailor the output schemas (column names, scoring weights, or the geography set) to match how you present to stakeholders—e.g., a single slide template or a memo style your leadership prefers.

## You (2025-09-06T06:08:38.701000+00:00)

I find this prompt much more appealing than the previous one. There are two modifications I would suggest. Firstly, instead of focusing on a larger geographical area, let’s concentrate solely on the city of San Francisco. Secondly, I believe the prompt itself subtly influences the thought process. While we’re supposed to outline a thought process, we should ideally avoid biasing it for the LLM through these specific examples. In many instances, you’ve listed out examples like airports or curbside pickups, or you’ve made references to very specific elements. While these are acceptable to some extent, rewrite the prompt in a way that minimizes or eliminates any word, reference, or example that could potentially bias the final outcome. To clarify, you can outline a thought process, but ideally, you should avoid providing specific examples that allow the LLM to independently generate ideas tailored to our goal.





## ChatGPT (2025-09-06T06:08:39.576531+00:00)

Got it — here’s the **SF-only, low-bias** orchestrator prompt. I’ve stripped out all specific examples and product names, and I’ve shifted from “listing ideas” to **forcing an evidence-first thought process** that lets the model generate its own SF-tailored opportunities.

# Prompt: Waymo Non-Price Advantage — San Francisco, Evidence-First Orchestrator (Unbiased)

**Role & Mission**
You are a senior strategy analyst and prompt engineer. Your task is to discover, validate, and prioritize **non-price** competitive advantages for **Waymo** against relevant services operating in **San Francisco** (both human-driven and autonomous), and to produce a decision-ready plan.

**Scope & Constraints**
- **Geography:** City of **San Francisco** only.
- **Horizon:** 0–24 months (H1: 0–3m; H2: 3–12m; H3: 12–24m).
- **Non-price only:** Exclude any direct or indirect price reductions.
- **Compliance & ethics:** Propose only actions consistent with applicable laws, safety, accessibility, and privacy standards.

**Bias-Minimization Protocol**
- Do **not** use seeded domain examples or pre-named solution patterns.
- Derive **all** categories, options, and hypotheses from SF-specific evidence and first principles.
- Generate **two independent ideation passes** (Set A, Set B) before converging; use separate sources/orderings for each to reduce anchoring.
- When you notice a pattern in sources, **state the pattern** before adopting it.

**Web & Evidence Rules**
- Use current, high-quality sources; prefer ≤12 months. If older, justify relevance.
- Normalize metrics to comparable exposure units where applicable.
- Each material claim must include an inline citation `[Publisher, Title, Date] (URL)`.
- When sources conflict, present both, explain the discrepancy, and state the implication for recommendations.

**Insight Tests** (apply to every proposed play)
1) **Non-obviousness** (counter to generic playbooks).
2) **Measurability** (clear KPI, baseline, target).
3) **Defensibility** (time-to-copy, capability gap, governance/operational friction).
4) **Scalability in SF** (expand across contexts within the city without linear cost).
5) **Feasibility** (permitting, partnerships, operations, staffing realistically obtainable).

**Scoring Model**
Report for each play:
- **Expected Value (EV)** = Impact(1–5) × Confidence(1–5) × Defensibility(1–5) × Speed-to-Impact(1–5) × Strategic Fit(1–5) − Risk(1–5).
- Show all sub-scores with one-sentence rationales.

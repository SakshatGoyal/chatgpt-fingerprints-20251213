# Recruitment email draft

## You (2025-08-26T22:16:00.557882+00:00)

Hey, could you write a simple recruitment email for me? So, for your context, I interviewed this one guy and we might have a follow-up with him. So, I want to ask him to give me three available times or three time slots or something where he's available so we can go ahead and schedule a sync-up with him and Rajiv and Sandeep.

Got it — you want to keep this professional but also warm, and make it easy for the candidate to respond with times that work. Here’s a draft you could use as a template:

**Subject:** Scheduling a Follow-Up Conversation

Hi [Candidate’s Name],

Thank you again for taking the time to speak with us earlier. We’d love to set up a follow-up conversation with you, Rajiv, and Sandeep. Could you please share three time slots over the next few days that work well for you? We’ll do our best to match one of them.

Looking forward to continuing the conversation.

Best,
[Your Name]

Would you like me to make it feel **more formal (like an HR-style email)** or **more casual (friendly, startup tone)**?

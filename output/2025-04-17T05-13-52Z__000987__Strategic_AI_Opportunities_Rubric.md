# Strategic AI Opportunities Rubric

## You (2025-04-17T05:13:52.415000+00:00)

Imagine you are Julie Zhuo, a former VP of Product Design at Facebook. As you imagine this, I also want you to imagine that you, Julie, have joined a new startup. Today, you are one of the founding members of the startup, and your startup is working towards finding ways to create AI solutions for helping Decision Makers at different companies evaluate, create, talk through, or think through, stress test, and do any number of things related to their strategy. This could be any strategy - M&A, go-to-market, political campaigns, crisis response for a drug company, innovation strategy for a VR company, or anything.

This is different from the typical use cases of AI. This isn't necessarily about content creation, where AI is used to automate content generation at a large scale. It also isn't about building agents that minimize manual, repeatable tasks. The startup isn't building AI to reduce manual work but to augment strategic thinking.

As a first step, your team has done very extensive research (even though it is literature research) on different challenges in executive decision making and strategic thinking. It was conducted by doing the following

- extracting data from multiple research papers
- sorting them based on themes and patterns
- Clustering multiple extracted stories from the research papers into 4 groups

🧩 Cluster 1: Fast-Moving, Externally Controlled Plays

This cluster captures activities that are highly constrained by external rules — legal, compliance, or institutional mandates — but still operate on tight, short-term windows of value. These are often tactically necessary functions, like regulated reporting, crisis response, or real-time market compliance. They’re “do it right, do it now” systems — high-stakes and high-velocity.

🔍 Think: Urgent actions with no room for improvisation. You’re executing fast, but within a very narrow lane.

⸻

🧩 Cluster 2: Durable, Loosely Bounded Systems

This group features work that creates longer-lasting value — frameworks, portfolios, or data assets — but with less regulatory pressure or institutional enforcement. These systems often live in strategic planning, innovation ops, or internal tooling — things that don’t need to move quickly but must remain relevant across time and changing conditions.

🔍 Think: Quiet infrastructure for thinking ahead. Less urgency, more staying power.

⸻

🧩 Cluster 3: Time-Sensitive, Modular Collaboration

These are collaborative systems that require synchronized effort, often across teams or platforms — but are structurally built to be modular. While execution must be coordinated (sometimes even real-time), the underlying process is designed to support distributed contribution, like DevOps rollouts or global campaign launches.

🔍 Think: Real-time orchestration without structural entanglement. You need everyone in sync, but not in the same room.

⸻

🧩 Cluster 4: Long-Arc Integration Work

This cluster reflects deeply interdependent systems that evolve over time. Unlike Cluster 3, these aren’t optimized for real-time or modularity. Instead, they require careful sequencing and integration — often seen in long-cycle initiatives like transformation programs, service architecture, or governance frameworks.

🔍 Think: Threading the whole system together over time. More like composing a symphony than playing a jazz jam.

Attached with this message, is a document - Cluster Synthesis. Here, multiple stories from different clusters were synthesized into themes.

Now, here's your job as a product and design leader - Look for true 'people problems' and the best potential opportunities to find a design direction for your startup team. But to do that, you need to cut through the noise. Your team has created a lot of insights, each labeled as

0101, 0102, 0103... 0405.

So you have a total of 20 themes, which may or may not be a lot. You're trying to communicate these tensions and issues to other stakeholders, investors, but you're also trying to find genuine tensions and opportunities for exploration. You're in a solution agnostic mode right now. You're not crafting the AI solution, you're just looking for opportunities.

---

In this response, how might you begin creating a rubric that could help you potentially narrow down on insights. Reduce noise, and find the gems. Read each module holistically, and don't rely solely on keywords, titles, etc. Right now you're just defining your approach to find the right issues to address.

As Julie Zhuo, looking to define a rubric to cut through the noise and identify genuine strategic tensions and meaningful human-centric opportunities, here's how I’d approach creating the rubric:

## Julie Zhuo’s Rubric for Prioritizing Genuine Strategic Opportunities

This rubric aims to prioritize and surface authentic strategic problems suitable for AI-powered strategic augmentation. Each of the 20 modules (0101 to 0405) would be evaluated holistically against the following criteria:

### Criterion 1: Depth of Human-Centric Pain
- **High:** Directly impacts executive stress, frustration, or uncertainty. Deeply affects decision-makers’ emotional states or perceived pressures.
- **Medium:** Noticeably impacts operational efficiency or effectiveness, but less emotionally charged.
- **Low:** Primarily procedural, minimal emotional or cognitive friction.

**Why this matters:** True opportunities resonate with real human struggles, not merely structural inefficiencies.

---

### Criterion 2: Strategic Value & Impact
- **High:** Dilemma explicitly influences key strategic outcomes (e.g., market leadership, existential risks, competitive differentiation).
- **Medium:** Clearly affects tactical performance, but less existential.
- **Low:** Operational or routine efficiency, limited strategic differentiation.

**Why this matters:** AI solutions should support critical decisions with meaningful strategic consequences.

---

### Criterion 3: Frequency & Recurrence of the Problem
- **High:** Persistent, recurring across multiple contexts or highly frequent occurrence.
- **Medium:** Occasional or context-dependent recurrence.
- **Low:** Rare, isolated occurrence.

**Why this matters:** Persistent problems represent more scalable opportunities.

---

### Criterion 4: Complexity and Ambiguity of the Challenge
- **High:** Richly complex dilemmas, ambiguous trade-offs, deeply entangled causality.
- **Medium:** Moderate complexity, clearer causal relationships.
- **Low:** Simple, straightforward cause-effect scenarios.

**Why this matters:** Complex problems benefit significantly from augmented strategic reasoning—perfect for AI augmentation.

---

### Criterion 5: Executive Receptiveness (Anticipated AI Utility)
- **High:** Clear potential for AI to augment nuanced reasoning, scenario testing, or strategic stress-testing.
- **Medium:** AI could help, but other solutions (process improvement, human consulting) might be equally suitable.
- **Low:** Limited relevance of AI, simpler tools or processes adequate.

**Why this matters:** Ensures direct alignment with the startup's core mission—augmenting strategic thinking.

ok, now i want you to continue your role as Julie Zhuo. Now that you've comprehensively layed out the entire criteria, I want you to evaluate each problem using the 'Julie Zhuo’s Rubric for Prioritizing Genuine Strategic Opportunities'


Return a table like this (illustrative example):
Module | Human Pain | Strategic Impact | Frequency | Complexity | AI Utility | Prioritization Score
0101 | High | High | High | High | High | 5 (Top Priority)
0102 | Medium | High | Medium | High | High | 4.5
...
...
...

Do not let one module influence your decision over the other. Evaluate each problem independently. Internalize the rubric as you evaluate each problem. Read the entire problem, and do not rely solely on individual statements, fancy/buzzwords, read through the entire synthesis while scoring the probem.

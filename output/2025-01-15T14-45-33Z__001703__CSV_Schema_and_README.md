AI is likely to hollow out the middle of organizations and that unless we deliberately find a way to upskill young people, there could be a skill shortage from their outsourcing to AI everything that they would have learned from doing themselves.   There are many ways to make AI more effective (read examples in text below and in diagrams).� It�s incumbent for both leaders and the front lines to invest the 10 or so hours in playing around with AI on something that they care about to distill the use cases and then leverage what AI is good at to become 20-30% more efficient.� Harnessed the right way, management teams that use AI effectively could become more attractive employers (by eliminating the joyless work � each of us can probably think of a number of examples of this!)  We can become more effective if we use AI as a devil�s advocate, coach or as a sounding board to check our work (not as a generator of ideas)  It�s incumbent on companies who are building AI to design ethics and alignment into it.  Large companies disclose what they choose about this, and its important to hold them accountable.� Regulation is also important.� Accountability includes thinking through how products can be misused before releasing them, ensuring high quality information, and sharing responsible AI research and best practices.",Expanding and Transforming AI Applications Across Industries,No Comments,Highest quality and most actionable content for my work in investing,It was a productive and informative day.

Make time for 1-2 audience questions per session, maybe take 2 at once for speakers to answer together to speed this up.  That would create more engagement.  There could even be a chat for speakers to engage with each other

End of README (Plain Text)

## You (2025-01-15T14:52:05.830049+00:00)

here's a Readme i created earlier. could u follow most of the content here already, along with the formatting.

For most of the 'score' columns, they have a logic. I've tried to describe that logic in this file, so I want to make sure that's incorporated.

"Age based on 3rd party data" this was based on a third party linkedin data we received. The way we calculated this was, we found the start date for people'e undergraduate program, assumed they were 18 at the time of enrollment, and derived their age at the time of the event from that.

"Age based on Registration Data" this was a calculated date from the registration data from the 'leading with ai' event. Basically, we found a list of people who graduated from Harvard. we assumed that they were 25 at the time of completing the MBA program, and derived their age at the time of the event based on that.

Below is the earlier readme file I made in plain text.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


How the following scores were calculation:

Overview:
This scoring system evaluates event feedback based on three dimensions:

1. Community and Peer Engagement: Measures how activities foster networking and collaboration.
2. Exposure to New Trends: Assesses the relevance of content to new ideas or practices.
3. General Score: Overall impact.


Scoring Methodology:
- Feedback items are manually scored:
        Each "Yes" response adds points based on pre-assigned weights for the dimensions.
- Scores are summed to calculate totals for each dimension and an overall event score.


Example:


Appreciated - Opportunity to Network:

Community and Peer Engagement: +2
Exposure to New Trends: +1
General Score: +2


Use Case:
Identify strengths (e.g., high "Appreciated" scores).
Prioritize improvements (e.g., high "Would Change" scores).
Aggregate insights for actionable recommendations.

How the following scores were calculated:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
This scoring system evaluates event feedback based on three dimensions:
1. **Community and Peer Engagement**: Measures how activities foster networking
   and collaboration.
2. **Exposure to New Trends**: Assesses the relevance of content to new ideas
   or practices.
3. **General Score**: Overall impact or satisfaction rating.

Scoring Methodology:
- Certain survey items are assigned a point value toward each dimension.
- Each “Yes” response (e.g., “Appreciated - Opportunity to Network”)
  contributes to the relevant dimension(s).
- Points are summed to form separate totals:
  - Score for Community Engagement
  - Score for Exposure to New Ideas
  - General Score (cumulative overall)

Example of Weighted Allocation:
**Appreciated - Opportunity to Network** might yield:
- Community Engagement: +2
- Exposure to New Trends: +1
- General Score: +2

Use Case:
By aggregating these scores across attendees, event organizers can:
- Identify where the event excelled (e.g., high average “General Score”).
- Pinpoint areas for improvement (e.g., if “Community Engagement” is low,
  add more networking sessions).
- Distill actionable recommendations (e.g., refine or expand breakout
  sessions if participants want more direct collaboration).

SCORING LOGIC
-------------
This scoring system evaluates event feedback based on three dimensions:

1. Community and Peer Engagement – how activities foster networking and collaboration
2. Exposure to New Trends – relevance of content to new ideas or practices
3. General Score – overall impact or satisfaction rating

Certain survey items are assigned a point value toward each dimension. Each “Yes”
response (e.g., “Appreciated - Opportunity to Network”) contributes to the relevant
dimension(s). Points are summed to create:

- Score for Community Engagement
- Score for Exposure to New Ideas
- General Score (cumulative overall)

Example:
"Appreciated - Opportunity to Network" might add:
- +2 to Community Engagement
- +1 to Exposure to New Ideas
- +2 to General Score

By aggregating these scores across attendees, event organizers can see strengths
(e.g., if General Score is high) and pinpoint areas for improvement (e.g., if
Community Engagement is lower).

Input_email is of course the users email the LinkedIn URL again is self-explanatory education column has a large text data but for now you could just say that it was extracted from the third-party data source for the rest of I'll give you an explanation earliest start date earliest start date refers to the undergraduate date in the education column, so that's the lowest day that was available started undergraduate again that's just a duplication of earliest start date. It's just I wanted to process or rather clean the data so that I don't get the whole deal. I just get the year birth here in this case is the start date -18 and so approximately age in 2024 based on third-party data that follows one of the previous explanations that we were talking about where we use the earliest start date assume that a person is starting undergraduate at the age of 18 and then based on the try to arrive the approximate age in 2024 for all these attendees age group again it's sort of self-explanatory but just write some kind of description for it the next column approximately age in 2024 bracket registration data. So the registration data actually came from the attendee registration form where I think we got information on the year in which they graduated from a NBA program and so we work with the assumption that these attendees were aged 25 when they graduated with an MBA from Harvard and we sort of worked our way back to figure out their age in 2024 as you can see there are two different approaches to forming or dividing the approximate age of these candidates in the final column that's called difference in approximate there I am basically finding out like the actual difference between the age based on third-party data and age based on registration data. This is just to add some context so I do want to mention that there might be inconsistencies or rather they might be inaccurate data in both columns approximate in 2024 based on third-party data and proxy 2024 based on registration data both of these could have inaccurate values, but for the most part, we have more data based on the third-party data and less based on registration data

README for Third-Party Age Data
-------------------------------

This document provides an overview of the columns found in the dataset.
It is intended as a quick reference for understanding how each field
was derived or used.

COLUMNS AND DETAILS
-------------------

1) input_email
   - Email address of the attendee
   - Examples: "bhelmick@imlboston.com", "hcox@howardcox.com"

2) Linkedin URL
   - URL linking to the attendee’s LinkedIn profile
   - Examples: "linkedin.com/in/brooks-helmick"

3) education
   - Extracted data (often large, detailed) from a third-party source regarding
     the attendee’s educational background
   - Examples: "[{'school': {'name': 'fairmont senior high school'...}, ...}]"

4) earliest_start_date
   - The earliest (lowest) start date found in the attendee’s educational record
     (usually the beginning of undergraduate study)
   - Examples: "08/01/1955"

5) Started Undergrad
   - A duplicate or simplified version of earliest_start_date
   - Used for data cleaning and easier parsing of the undergraduate start year
   - Examples: "1955", "1960"

6) Birth Year
   - Derived by subtracting 18 years from the earliest_start_date (assuming
     18 at the start of undergrad)
   - Examples: "1937", "1942"

7) Approx Age in 2024 (based on 3rd party data)
   - An approximate age calculated by assuming the attendee was 18 at their
     undergrad start. Using that logic, their age in 2024 is derived.
   - Examples: "87", "82"

8) Age Group
   - Broad category for grouping ages (e.g., “65 and over”)
   - Examples: "65 and over"

9) Approx Age in 2024 (Registration Data)
   - Approximate age in 2024 based on separate registration info (e.g.,
     assuming they were 25 when they earned an MBA). If no registration data
     was available, this field might be "N/A."
   - Examples: "80", "76"

10) Difference in Approximates
    - The difference between the “Approx Age in 2024 (based on 3rd party data)”
      and the “Approx Age in 2024 (Registration Data).”
    - Helps highlight where there are mismatches or potential inaccuracies in
      either data source.
    - Examples: "2", "6"

NOTES ON DATA ACCURACY
----------------------
- Both approximate ages (from third-party data vs. registration data) are
  estimates that rely on assumptions (like “18 at undergrad start” or
  “25 at MBA completion”).
- Inconsistencies can arise (e.g., a mismatch in the difference column).
  Some entries may be incomplete or inaccurate in one or both calculations.
- The Age Group column is a simple categorization (e.g., “65 and over”) and
  should not be treated as an exact classification.

Use these columns to compare or reference approximate attendee ages, but
be aware of possible errors or variations in the underlying data.

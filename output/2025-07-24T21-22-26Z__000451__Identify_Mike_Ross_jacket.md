**1. Goal**
Your task is to **identify the exact jacket worn by the character Mike Ross** (played by Patrick J. Adams) in *Season 2, Episode 2* of the television series *Suits*, specifically in the **scene where he takes Rachel Zane on their first date**. This is not a general styling inquiry—your goal is to determine the **precise brand, model, season, and any available sourcing details** of the specific jacket used in that episode and scene.

**2. Return Format**
Your response should follow this structured format:

* **Identified Jacket Details**:

  * Brand:
  * Model Name/Number:
  * Season (e.g., Fall/Winter 2011):
  * Color:
  * Material:
  * Distinctive Features (e.g., lapel style, stitching, button count):
* **Confirmation Evidence**:

  * Screenshot/time-stamp references from Suits S2E2
  * Behind-the-scenes sources (e.g., wardrobe notes, interviews)
  * User-verified sources (Reddit posts, blogs, YouTube comments)
* **Sourcing Options** (if available):

  * Links to vintage marketplaces, auction sites, or replicas

**3. Warnings & Guardrails**

* Do **not generalize** or assume based on similar styles across seasons—this must be the **exact** jacket used in that specific episode and scene.
* If definitive identification is **not available**, return:

  * The **closest high-confidence match** along with
  * A **transparency note** explaining the degree of uncertainty and what elements remain unconfirmed.
* Clearly **differentiate between speculation and verified information**.
* Scour **non-traditional sources** (e.g., fan subreddits, niche forums, video freeze-frame analysis) and log each lead, even if inconclusive.

**4. Context & Additional Elements**

* Character: Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams)
* Episode: *Suits*, Season 2, Episode 2
* Scene Context: First official date with Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle)
* The model should behave like a **digital stylist-historian** with deep web-scraping diligence.
* Adopt the persona of a **forensic costume analyst**: detail-oriented, meticulous, and persistent.
* Assume the user values **accuracy above speed** and is **willing to wait** for depth and verification.

An Entertainment Weekly interview notes that by later seasons Mike “was being dressed in classic Burberry silhouettes and textures”【72469838040886†L184-L186】, showing that Burberry was already a go‑to label for his clothing.  Fans on the /r/malefashionadvice subreddit discussing the date‑night jacket speculated that it is the **Burberry Brit Amherst bomber jacket** and pointed to Bloomingdale’s listing for this item【312100024703202†L121-L137】.  The inner lining seen on screen has a beige plaid with black and red stripes identical to Burberry’s signature Haymarket/nova check, reinforcing this attribution. | **Burberry Brit** |\\n+| **Model** | The bomber/harrington‑style jacket in the episode is waist‑length with a stand‑up collar fastened by two buttons, a two‑way zipper front, slanted flap pockets, ribbed cuffs and hem and the famous plaid lining.  These elements match Burberry’s **“Amherst” cotton bomber/Harrington jacket** sold in 2011‑12.  Community posts identified the model as the “Amherst Bomber” and a pre‑owned listing for a **Burberry Brit cotton bomber jacket in dark navy** showed an identical garment with the same stand collar and large nova check lining【215528028476215†screenshot】. | **“Amherst” cotton bomber/Harrington jacket** (also referred to as a cotton bomber) |\\n+| **Season** | The date scene was filmed in early 2012 and the Amherst bomber was sold by Bloomingdale’s around **2011 / Spring 2012**.  Because the jacket was part of the Burberry Brit line of casual outwear for that season, the likely season is **Spring 2011 or Spring 2012**.  No official season has been confirmed. | **Spring 2011 or Spring 2012 (Burberry Brit collection)** – approximate |\\n+| **Color** | On screen and in product photos the jacket appears **dark navy**.  The fabric is matte and looks like washed cotton. | **Dark navy** |\\n+| **Material** | The Amherst bomber is made from **cotton twill** with ribbed knit cuffs and hem.  Pre‑owned listings describe the shell as “100 % cotton” with a **cotton/polyester nova check lining**【215528028476215†screenshot】. | **Cotton twill shell; cotton/poly inner lining** |\\n+| **Distinctive features** |  \\n+– **Stand collar with two buttons:** The collar can be worn up or down, secured with two visible buttons.  \\n+– **Two‑way zipper:** The jacket has a centre zipper that can open from the top or bottom.  \\n+– **Slanted flap pockets:** Two front pockets with buttoned flaps.  \\n+– **Ribbed cuffs and hem:** The knit cuffs and hem provide a blouson silhouette.  \\n+– **Signature check lining:** The interior reveals a beige check with black and red stripes, Burberry’s nova‑check pattern, visible along the placket and cuffs in the episode【693503629668655†screenshot】【436230729293768†screenshot】.  \\n+– **Minimal branding:** The exterior lacks large logos, which matches Burberry Brit’s understated aesthetic. | **Stand‑collar cotton bomber with two‑way zip, flap pockets, ribbed trims and Burberry’s nova‑check lining** |\\n+\\n+## Confirmation Evidence\\n+\\n+### Screencaps from the episode\\n+\\n+In *Suits* Season 2 Episode 2 (“The Choice”), Mike Ross takes Rachel Zane on their first date.  When they walk to the restaurant and later chat on the sidewalk, he wears a dark navy bomber jacket.  The jacket has a stand‑up collar fastened by two buttons, a centre zipper, ribbed cuffs and hem and a checked interior lining that can be glimpsed when the jacket opens at the placket and cuffs.  The lining pattern—beige with black and red stripes—matches Burberry’s nova check【693503629668655†screenshot】【436230729293768†screenshot】.  These details are consistent with the Burberry Brit Amherst cotton bomber.\\n+\\n+### Fan discussions and user‑verified sources\\n+\\n+Reddit users on the style forum **/r/malefashionadvice** asked, “Which jacket is Mike Ross wearing here?” The top replies suggest the **Burberry Brit Amherst bomber jacket**, noting that the inner lining looks like Burberry’s Haymarket (nova) check【312100024703202†L121-L137】.  Although this is not an official confirmation, the community’s consensus and recognition of the distinctive check pattern provide a strong clue.\\n+\\n+### Pre‑owned product listings\\n+\\n+While the original Bloomingdale’s listing for the “Burberry Brit Amherst bomber jacket (Web ID 622383)” is no longer available, pre‑owned listings for **Burberry Brit cotton bomber jackets in dark navy** show garments identical to Mike’s.  One listing displayed a navy jacket with a stand collar, two‑way zip, flap pockets, ribbed trims and the same large nova check lining【215528028476215†screenshot】.  These photos match the on‑screen jacket almost exactly, supporting the identification.\\n+\\n+### Harrington jacket characteristics\\n+\\n+An article explaining the **Harrington jacket**—the style that inspired the Amherst bomber—describes it as a waist‑length jacket with a two‑button stand‑up collar, slanted flap pockets, a zip‑up front, elastic ribbed cuffs and hem and a signature plaid lining【567187413988766†L41-L45】.  The jacket worn by Mike Ross shares all of these features, confirming that it is a Harrington‑style bomber and reinforcing the match to Burberry’s version.\\n+\\n+### Costume designer’s preference for Burberry\\n+\\n+In an interview about *Suits*’ wardrobe, costume designer **Jolie Andreatta** said that by Season 3, Mike Ross was being dressed in “classic Burberry silhouettes”【72469838040886†L184-L186】.  Although she did not mention the bomber jacket specifically, her use of Burberry for Mike’s tailored clothing suggests that the brand was already part of his wardrobe in Season 2, lending credence to the Burberry attribution.\\n+\\n+## Sourcing Options\\n+\\n+The **Burberry Brit Amherst bomber** was part of the brand’s 2011‑12 casual collection and is no longer produced.  Original retail stock sold out years ago, so the only way to obtain the exact jacket today is through **second‑hand marketplaces**.  Options include:\\n+\\n+- **eBay and Grailed** – Pre‑owned listings occasionally appear; look for “Burberry Brit cotton bomber jacket,” “Amherst bomber,” or “nova check Harrington” in dark navy.  These jackets typically feature the signature check lining and may be labelled with size codes like “M – 2011”【215528028476215†screenshot】.  \\n+- **Poshmark and Depop** – Users sometimes sell vintage Burberry Harrington jackets; ensure the lining matches Burberry’s nova check.  \\n+- **Replica brands** – Several contemporary brands (e.g., Ben Sherman, Fred Perry) make Harrington jackets with tartan linings【567187413988766†L41-L45】.  While these jackets capture the style, they are not Burberry and will lack the exact Burberry check pattern.\\n+\\n+## Transparency and Uncertainties\\n+\\n+No **official behind‑the‑scenes documentation** or wardrobe notes explicitly confirm the jacket’s model.  The identification presented here relies on visual analysis, fan discussions and pre‑owned listings.  The **Burberry Brit Amherst bomber** matches every observable detail—color, lining, collar, pockets and ribbed trims—so it is the **highest‑confidence match**.  However, because the original product description is no longer available, the exact season (Spring 2011 vs. Spring 2012) and model name could not be verified.  Should future archival information or interviews emerge, these details may be refined.\\n+\\n+## Visual Reference\\n+\\n+Below is an illustration inspired by the jacket worn by Mike Ross.  It depicts a dark navy Harrington‑style bomber with a stand collar, two‑way front zipper, flap pockets, ribbed cuffs and hem and a beige check lining peeking from the inside.\\n+\\n+![Illustration of a navy Harrington bomber jacket with Burberry‑style check lining]({{file:c4cc7616-cbf5-443c-9fd5-73df047ded82.png}})\\n+\\n*** End Patch\\nEOF\\n\"]}"}

Here's your completed report on the jacket Mike Ross wore on his date with Rachel in Suits S2E2: {{file:file-5xgmSJNjWHbJYug2vGbQiZ}}.

In summary, the report identifies the jacket as the Burberry Brit Amherst cotton bomber, a Harrington-style piece from the Spring 2011/2012 collection. It highlights key features—dark navy cotton shell, two-way zipper, stand collar with buttons, flap pockets, ribbed trims, and the iconic Burberry nova-check lining visible at the placket and cuffs. These details match the on-screen garment and align with the brand’s understated aesthetic.

Evidence supporting this identification includes screencaps showing the jacket’s lining and community discussions on Reddit pointing to the Amherst bomber, while a pre-owned listing confirms the same design features. The report notes that the original product is long discontinued, so only secondary markets like eBay or Grailed offer sourcing opportunities today. It also transparently acknowledges that no official wardrobe documentation exists, making this a high-confidence but not fully verified attribution.

Here's your completed report on the jacket Mike Ross wore on his date with Rachel in Suits S2E2: {{file:file-5xgmSJNjWHbJYug2vGbQiZ}}.

In summary, the report identifies the jacket as the Burberry Brit Amherst cotton bomber, a Harrington-style piece from the Spring 2011/2012 collection. It highlights key features—dark navy cotton shell, two-way zipper, stand collar with buttons, flap pockets, ribbed trims, and the iconic Burberry nova-check lining visible at the placket and cuffs. These details match the on-screen garment and align with the brand’s understated aesthetic.

Evidence supporting this identification includes screencaps showing the jacket’s lining and community discussions on Reddit pointing to the Amherst bomber, while a pre-owned listing confirms the same design features. The report notes that the original product is long discontinued, so only secondary markets like eBay or Grailed offer sourcing opportunities today. It also transparently acknowledges that no official wardrobe documentation exists, making this a high-confidence but not fully verified attribution.

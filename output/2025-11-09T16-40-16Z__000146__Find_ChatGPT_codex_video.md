Help me find a video of someone online using ChatGPT codex to build a small application completely from scratch with no manual work in the mix.

Here’s a video that closely matches what you’re looking for — building a small application from scratch using entity["software", "OpenAI Codex", 0] via entity["software", "ChatGPT", 0]:

(Video link: **“I Built an Entire App with OpenAI’s Codex and 8 AI Agents”** on YouTube)

### Why this video is a good fit:
- It shows **“no idea whatsoever to fully built out”** using Codex, meaning minimal manual coding.
- Demonstrates how Codex + agents can generate an application end-to-end.
- Good for your interest in seeing how one can delegate work to the AI with minimal manual intervention.

### A couple of caveats (so you’re aware):
- “No manual work” is tricky — it’s unlikely that *zero* manual oversight or configuration is required, because things like prompts, environment setup or review still happen.
- It may involve configurations or scaffolding (repo setup, agent instructions) that counts as some “manual work”.
- The video may show more than just a “small application” — depending on how the creator defines “app”.

If you like, I can **search for several more videos** (especially ones that target strictly “from scratch” small applications, 10-30 minutes long) and share 2-3 options with summaries so you can pick your favorite. Would you like me to do that?

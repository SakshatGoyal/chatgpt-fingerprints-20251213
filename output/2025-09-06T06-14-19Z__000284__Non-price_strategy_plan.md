# Non-price strategy plan





## You (2025-09-06T06:14:19.967000+00:00)

You are a senior strategist. Your task is to discover, validate, and prioritize **non-price** competitive advantages for **Waymo** against relevant services operating in **San Francisco** (both human-driven and autonomous), and to produce a decision-ready plan.

**Scope & Constraints**

* **Geography:** City of **San Francisco** only.
* **Horizon:** 0–24 months (H1: 0–3m; H2: 3–12m; H3: 12–24m).
* **Non-price only:** Exclude any direct or indirect price reductions.
* **Compliance & ethics:** Propose only actions consistent with applicable laws, safety, accessibility, and privacy standards.

**Bias-Minimization Protocol**

* Do **not** use seeded domain examples or pre-named solution patterns.
* Derive **all** categories, options, and hypotheses from SF-specific evidence and first principles.
* Generate **two independent ideation passes** (Set A, Set B) before converging; use separate sources/orderings for each to reduce anchoring.
* When you notice a pattern in sources, **state the pattern** before adopting it.

**Web & Evidence Rules**

* Use current, high-quality sources; prefer ≤12 months. If older, justify relevance.
* Normalize metrics to comparable exposure units where applicable.
* Each material claim must include an inline citation `[Publisher, Title, Date] (URL)`.
* When sources conflict, present both, explain the discrepancy, and state the implication for recommendations.

**Insight Tests** (apply to every proposed play)

1. **Non-obviousness** (counter to generic playbooks).
2. **Measurability** (clear KPI, baseline, target).
3. **Defensibility** (time-to-copy, capability gap, governance/operational friction).
4. **Scalability in SF** (expand across contexts within the city without linear cost).
5. **Feasibility** (permitting, partnerships, operations, staffing realistically obtainable).

**Scoring Model**
Report for each play:

* **Expected Value (EV)** = Impact(1–5) × Confidence(1–5) × Defensibility(1–5) × Speed-to-Impact(1–5) × Strategic Fit(1–5) − Risk(1–5).
* Show all sub-scores with one-sentence rationales.

## Workstreams & Deliverables (return **only** these artifacts, in order)

### W1) Landscape & Hypotheses  *(CPA: exploration without pre-seeding)*

* **A1. Competitor Set (SF):** Identify 3–5 relevant competitors active in SF; justify inclusion with citations.
* **A2. Taxonomy:** Construct a data-driven taxonomy of **non-price levers** (model-generated). Provide the method used to derive it (clustering, thematic analysis, etc.).
* **A3. Advantage Matrix (table):** Rows = levers from your taxonomy; Columns = Customer Value, Feasibility at Waymo, Defensibility, Time-to-Impact, Key Risks, Representative Proof (citations).
* **A4. Hypotheses (6–10):** Falsifiable, SF-specific; each links to a target segment, a primary KPI, a baseline, a target, and **“what would make this false.”**

### W2) Wargame  *(CPA: adversarial refinement)*

* **B1. Three-Round Move–Countermove Table:** For the top hypotheses; Rounds at T0, +90d, +180d. Include your explicit assumptions about competitor resources and constraints.
* **B2. Net Advantage Delta:** Qualitative + quantitative estimate after each round; list the assumptions that drive the delta.
* **B3. Design Changes:** Specify the precise changes you make to preserve/expand the edge based on the wargame.

### W3) Concept Evolution & Synthesis  *(CPA: evolutionary + multi-perspective)*

* **C1. Variants:** For the top three plays, generate 2–3 distinct variants **without** using any examples from this prompt.
* **C2. Hybridization:** Combine the strongest elements into **one** hybrid per play; document why each element remains.
* **C3. Moat Mutation:** Add a single element that materially raises **time-to-copy**. Describe why it is costly/difficult to replicate in SF.
* **C4. Fitness Scorecard:** Impact, Feasibility, Defensibility, Risk (brief justifications).

### W4) Assumption Testing & Counterfactuals  *(CPA: dialectic inquiry)*

* **D1. Assumption Ledger:** List key assumptions underpinning each play; attach evidence **for** and **against** each.
* **D2. Counterfactuals (SF-specific):** Generate and analyze at least three “worlds” that would invalidate or weaken the plays; propose adaptations for each.
* **D3. Acceptance Criteria:** City-specific, measurable thresholds that define success/failure for each play.

### W5) Constraint-Aware Roadmap  *(CPA: constraint dynamics)*

* **E1. Constraint Ledger:** SF-specific constraints across regulation, public-sector coordination, infrastructure, operating domains, workforce/community expectations, and privacy.
* **E2. Progressive Adaptation Notes:** Show how each constraint alters the ideal design and document the chosen trade-off.
* **E3. Final Roadmap:** Sequenced pilots within SF contexts; owners; budget ranges; milestones; **kill criteria**; decision triggers; KPIs (leading & lagging) with baselines and 90-day targets; risk register with contingencies.

### W6) Distribution & Data-Moat Audit  *(CPA: synthesis without product-name prompting)*

* **F1. Controllable Assets Map:** Identify first-party assets and integration points Waymo can legitimately deploy in SF (model-generated; no product names provided here).
* **F2. Switching-Cost Analysis:** For each asset/integration, estimate user lock-in mechanics, legal/privacy feasibility, copy friction (time, capital), and governance hurdles.
* **F3. Privacy-by-Design Notes:** Explain how the approach maintains user trust while meeting legal and social expectations in SF.

---

## Evaluation & Decision Pack  *(CPA: self-evaluation, artifacts only)*

* **G1. EV Ranking Table:** All plays ranked with sub-scores.
* **G2. Three “No-Regrets” Moves** and **Three “Option Bets.”**
* **G3. One-Page Executive Summary:** Thesis, key numbers, SF sequencing, first 90-day plan, major risks & mitigations.
* **G4. 40-Point Process Score:** Accuracy, Efficiency, Process, Innovation (1–10 each) with 2–3 bullets on “what to improve next time.”

**Output Rules**

* Do **not** reveal hidden chain-of-thought; return only the artifacts above.
* Make all tables readable in chat.
* Every material claim needs a citation. If a key claim lacks data, provide a test plan to learn fast (design, metric, minimal sample).

Understood. I’ll proceed to research and develop a comprehensive decision-ready plan for Waymo’s non-price competitive advantages in San Francisco. I will focus on creating a structured work plan covering competitor analysis, taxonomy construction, hypothesis testing, wargaming, and strategic recommendations across multiple time horizons. I’ll adhere strictly to the user’s bias-minimization protocol, recency requirements, and deliverables sequence. I’ll begin gathering sources and evidence to support all claims and will ensure all deliverables are comprehensive and actionable within the specified constraints.

Could you please provide a comprehensive list of hotels located within the magenta-marked area on this map of Surat? I am specifically seeking mid-to-high-end hotels that offer a range of quality amenities. Ideal features would include complimentary Wi-Fi, a well-equipped gym, and reliable room service.

Here’s a best-effort, up-to-date list of the mid-to-high-end hotels that fall inside your magenta area (Athwa/City Light → Piplod/Vesu/Dumas/Airport corridor → Udhna/Shakti Nagar). I called out Wi-Fi, gym, and room-service status for each.

**1) Surat Marriott Hotel (Athwa Lines, on Dumas Rd/riverfront)**  
Wi-Fi: complimentary • Gym: yes (24-hr fitness) • Room service: **24-hour**. Also has spa & pool. citeturn11search2turn8search8

**3) Courtyard by Marriott Surat (Earthspace, Hazira/Dumas Rd – Piplod/Vesu side)**  
Wi-Fi: complimentary • Gym: **24-hr health club** • Room service: **not offered** (in-property dining instead). Has outdoor pool. citeturn0search1turn8search6turn8search1

Wi-Fi: yes • Gym: **yes** (plus sauna/steam & pool) • Room service: **listed as 24-hour**. citeturn6search1turn6search3

**5) The Grand Bhagwati (TGB) — Magdalla Circle, Dumas Rd (Piplod/Vesu belt)**

### Notes & quick guidance
- If you need **all three** (reliable room service + solid gym + good Wi-Fi), your most consistent options inside the boundary are **Surat Marriott** and **Regenta – The World**; **Weekend Address** also fits if you like the airport/Dumas side. citeturn11search2turn12search5turn6search3  
- **Courtyard by Marriott Surat** is great on gym/pool/Wi-Fi, but **does not offer room service**, which can be a deal-breaker if you need in-room dining. citeturn8search1  
- A few well-known hotels you might see in searches—**Hilton Garden Inn City Centre** (Ring Road/station area) and **Park Inn by Radisson (Adajan)**—sit **outside** your magenta zone (north of the Tapi), so I didn’t include them. citeturn3search0turn3search1

If you want, I can turn this into a quick comparison grid (price range, driving times to VR Surat/Airport/Dumas), or drop pins on a shareable map strictly inside your pink outline.

### Top-Rated Hotels Inside the Magenta Zone (15–17 Nov 2025)
Only two of the eight hotels you listed meet the quality requirement of ≥4.2/5 (≈8.4/10) and ≥200 verified reviews in the past year.  Courtyard by Marriott Surat (~7.5/10, 263 reviews) and Ginger Surat (~6/10, 51 reviews) do **not** meet the minimum‑rating threshold, while The Grand Bhagwati, The Long‑D, Zip by Spree and Weekend Address either lack enough recent reviews or ratings are below the cutoff.  Below is a detailed comparison of the two qualifying properties.

| Hotel & OTA | Rating (past‑12‑month reviews) | Room type / size / bed | Base price* | Cancellation & payment | Key amenities |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### Deal‑stacking & membership insights
1. **Expedia / Hotels.com One Key membership:** signing in earns “One Key Cash” on every booking and can unlock **Member Prices** (often 10% off).  For Surat Marriott, Expedia shows a “Sign in for extra savings” badge on the search page【84044864738142†screenshot】.
2. **Booking.com Genius**: Level 1 provides 10% off select rates; Level 2 or 3 (for frequent bookers) may add complimentary breakfast or room upgrades.  Marriott’s listing sometimes offers a Genius discount.
3. **Direct booking (Marriott Bonvoy)**: members often receive a lower “Member Rate” and can redeem/earn points.  Promotional codes (e.g., corporate, AAA, senior) may reduce rates further; credit‑card holders (e.g., Marriott Bonvoy Boundless) earn extra points and potential statement credits.
4. **Bank / card‑specific offers**: some Indian banks run promotions on OTAs like MakeMyTrip or Agoda.  For example, ICICI and HDFC cards periodically offer 10–20% off hotel bookings; check your card’s offers page and apply promo codes at checkout.
5. **App‑exclusive & first‑time‑user deals**: OTAs such as Agoda and MakeMyTrip give extra discounts when booking through their mobile app or when creating a new account (e.g., ₹1 200 off first booking).  Downloading the app and subscribing to email newsletters can yield promo codes.

### Recommendations
- **Best overall value:** **Surat Marriott Hotel**, booked via **Expedia** or **Booking.com**.  It meets the rating criteria (8.8/10 from >500 reviews【163737932978861†L20-L23】), includes upscale amenities (pool, spa, gym), and offers a fully refundable, pay‑later rate.  Expedia’s base “Deluxe King” rate (~$121/night【485773905497482†screenshot】) is slightly lower than Booking.com’s twin‑room rate, and signing in may unlock further savings.  Consider adding breakfast only if desired (about +$25/night on Expedia or +$18/night on Booking).
- **Alternative:** **Regenta – The World Surat** offers a great rating (8.7/10, 218 reviews)【832281894410566†L21-L27】 and resort‑style amenities, but Booking.com shows no availability for 15–17 Nov【832281894410566†L46-L52】.  If your dates are flexible, check Expedia/Hotels.com or adjust by ±1 day; rates around ₹5 451/night (~$66) were found for 16 Nov【99421354834065†L276-L278】.  This property is slightly farther from the city centre but still within your marked zone.

### Final tip
When you’re ready to book, open the relevant OTA as a signed‑in user (or the Marriott Bonvoy site) to unlock member prices and apply any applicable promo codes.  Double‑check cancellation windows (many allow free cancellation until **13 Nov 2025**).  If you hold a card with travel‑credit benefits or hotel‑chain affiliation, factor those rewards into the net cost.

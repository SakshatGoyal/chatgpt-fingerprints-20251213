Title: "AI-Powered Acquisitions: A New Playbook"
Transcript: "(00:00) traditionally private Equity isn't focused on fundamentally Shifting the way that the business Works what I'm talking about is actually building like a technology business and like a technology core my big idea is romanticizing in organic growth um and really what that means is I see like the next evolution of private Equity being possible where small businesses um Can leverage technology to basically like automate parts of their services organization and then go and use a better busines s model to acquire other small businesses obviously llms or (00:32) AI are kind of the Talk of the Town penetrating every industry but tell me what you're seeing on the ground in terms of how these llms are reshaping Industries yeah you know it's just amazing to see how fast adoption has been across whether it's horizontal applications or vertical applications and just for the for this conversation maybe we'll focus on the vertical yeah obviously we recently announced our investment at 11x which is automating like the sales function and I don't think I've ever really seen demand like (00:57) what we're seeing for basically automating the role of an SDR so you're kind of already seeing it within the sales organization if you think even on a a more vertical specific basis I see it in like Freight with companies like happy robot basically automating the call center operations around what a freight broker does whether it's like calling and you know booking a load or dealing with a new carr ier that a freight broker has to deal with we see it in healthcare with another one our portfolio companies tenor which is (01:22) automating the back office processes associated with a small Healthcare practice and so I think we're seeing a bunch of these applications pop up and frankly have growth rates on like anything I've ever seen again yeah and I love those examples cuz you're touching so many different Industries and maybe if we zoom out just a little bit and think about maybe like a fra mework for disruption how do you think about where maybe this could be applied the way to kind of just zoom out and think about this opportunity is like where are there (01:45) a bunch of humans that are basically dealing with whether it's voice or um paper processes where there's a bunch of unstructured data that they need to basically synthesize and then make sense of and then generate some sort of output like obviously that's what llms are super good at and so like the very common way of thin king about that might be like hey there's a call center somewhere right that's like the healthcare or the insurance example or the sales example um or maybe you have some sort of you know we call it the (02:09) messy inbox problem here where there's a bunch of different pieces of paper that are coming in and you need to synthesize them and put them into some database but oftentimes that's like an internal team um but then also you could look for wherever there might be BPO spend like business pr ocess Outsourcing spend um where maybe a a consulting firm is doing this for you so those are kind of the hot buttons a bits not atoms industry like you're dealing with paper um not physical world things um and something that is conducive to be (02:35) automated by LMS I have to admit when I was reading your big idea I thought isn't this just kind of like private Equity so convince me otherwise how is this different from traditional private Equity first like what is private Equity like I think t hat's important to like just talk about um to oversimplify like private Equity is a buyer purchases a company using some combination of equity and debt um traditionally like a good deal of debt uh and then basically tries to improve earnings in the relatively short term right normally private Equity (03:02) has like a 3 to 5e hold period um and then sell it to the next buire uh private Equity firms typically are optimizing for irr internal rate of return um and they're less focused on like ultim ately like a a multiple on money basically saying like they're not focused on the biggest possible version of the company that they could build rather they're focused on making incremental improvements in this time period because that's like how they think about liquidity and looks how the model works the problem with that is it creates like (03:29) a little bit of a RSE incentive structure where typically they're focused on like one of two ways of making money first is like the most obvious lik e when people hear like private Equity it's like oh no people are going to get fired um but obviously what they're trying to say is hey this hasn't been run in the most lean and efficient way maybe it possibly could have and so you know hey the accounting department doesn't need to be this big or maybe we can consolidate these two different teams or whatever it might be (03:52) that's the first bucket the second bucket normally is saying hey we're going to go acquire other small businesses or la rge businesses doesn't matter we're going to acquire other companies we're going to use more equity in debt um and we're going to basically buy the NX incremental company for a lower multiple roll it into our company and have multiple expansion so these are the two like two very common ways that private Equity firms make money so I think what's interesting about this model is that it's actually addressing (04:17) like a third leg of the stool in my opinion where you know traditionally private Eq uity isn't focused on like fundamentally Shifting the way that the business Works what I'm talking about is actually building like a technology business and like a technology core to a traditional services company right so in the past like a private Equity Firm would say hey like we don't need that many people in accounting I'm talking about automating like a large swwa of the company and to do so you need to have a very different view on returns (04:42) and you need to have a very different vie w on short-term earnings um because what will end up happening is like turns out Engineers pretty expensive um right and it requires like significant investment to get this business to you know a more automated State um and so you have to not think about like irr over the next two or 3 years and instead you need to be thinking about like what's the largest long-term valuable business that I can build um and how do I invest in that future so that's like the very different you know way of (05:10) building businesses there's a couple of examples on the public markets that are a little bit more holdco traditional software versions of this but one is a very well known company called danaher there's another one called Tyler Technologies based out of Texas these are like probably the best examples of these businesses historically but again they're not AI native right and and they're basically focused on the the first two buckets of of this which is like Financial engineering uh Andor like ope rational efficiency not building in (05:39) uh AI to their to their businesses no that's super interesting and I think just for the listeners let's try to be really concrete here and paint a picture of what this could look like this idea or opportunity of quote AI powered vertical specific service startups yeah um so tell meou yeah I was going to say it's it's a lot of s's but what would that look like like let's try to really paint a picture here okay so let's imagine that you know Steph has an insurance agency in Columbia Missouri okay um so you let's call it's a small (06:05) Insurance Agency you do three or four million in Gross written premium that generally will mean you you do a few hundred thousand call half a million dollars in Revenue net revenue um let's say you have single- digit margins on that Revenue so like you're living a nice life in Columbia Missouri but like this is a small business yes there are thousands tens of thousands of these businesses Across America you're selling you know imagine Home Auto life insurance and a little bit of Commercial Insurance um at your step's insurance (06:31) agency maybe you have one or two or three people in the back office you know maybe there's a CSM that's dealing with like net new business that you're writing there's someone in the back office that's dealing with all the paperwork right because when you write an insurance policy it's like hey I got to get a bunch of information from the customer I got to go get the quot e from my legacy system and I got to write all this stuff down and I got to deal with all these back office processes it's painful basically that's the reason your (06:53) margin is is so low um and you've tried to fix this right you've tried to buy software but the only software in this industry is really Legacy right like there's these two big businesses in Insurance you don't really have a great system here I come to you and I say hey Steph like wouldn't it be great if I could give you like b asically automation that could take all of that paperwork that you've been paying you know 5 10 15 plus per of your net margin for right and we can automate it and what does that require like it will require you (07:24) going and getting deeply integrated from the technology side deeply integrated into the core systems of record right leveraging a AI agents to basically have some of those conversations with the customer whether it's on new business on renewal or on client servicing and then actu ally resolving these claims in real time or like resolving these service issues in real time now Steph's Insurance Agency doesn't need four people it might need two people it might need one person um and you go from having 5% net margins to 30% net margins (07:51) and you know you go and you put a pool in uh or whatever it might be um or frankly what what I think is really exciting is you use that extra cash and you buy John's Insurance Agency down the street and now you see what the opportunity is to to run this Playbook yeah because basically what you're saying is that what you what you put into the technology can be replicated forer other business here tell me a little bit more about why you need to buy the company though did I not create a tool that just sells into (08:19) John's insurance company Steph's insurance company you actually made a really good point at the end of what you just said which is like hey this can be applied to the next business yes and if you build this softw are I think in the right way in the right in the right industry vertical once you've built those like core Integrations in the example that we were just doing it's into like the applied epic system or whatever core system of Records exists across the small business you're thinking about um those systems are in (08:44) many cases in these Legacy industry are pretty ubiquitous and so you can kind of repurpose this technology across each one of these small businesses I'm not saying it's going to be simple or easy it'll require implementation but that's the opportunity here is to stay vertical specific and build this like deep kind of understanding of the of the the system um but that's it's a great question on like why not just sell software to these companies they just aren't accustomed to running their companies this way I've gone and I've (09:09) tried to sell software to a mom and pop Insurance Agency in Columbia Missouri um trying to drive adoption is super tricky and so in buying th e business instead of like trying to do business development exercises and like convince someone that like hey the you know the the the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is worth it for you instead we can now say actually like hey like this is what we're going to run the business um operationally this is our new Cadence and our new workflow and and here's how we're going to you know get to the next (09:36) stage so you're saying basically in purchasing the business it gives you the leeway to actually shift things fundamentally which is really what this is articulating um maybe another question is just you seem to think this is a really big opportunity PE itself is a huge industry so why do you think this is actually maybe a bigger opportunity than traditional private I so I think that this all comes down to Capital efficiency um and so for example like you know buying one of these small companies that I just described like (10:02) isn't actually like that expensive of an Endeavor a nd if you can do what I'm talking about you impact earnings and all of a sudden like the first one two or three maybe you don't immediately pay back um using cash but after like the first few of these transactions you start to throw off cash and that cash can then be used to acquire more and more of these small businesses and so there becomes this beautiful um like flywheel effect to the Acquisitions that you can make and then that new businesses you acquire and so unlike (10:30) traditional pri vate Equity where you're constantly raising debt maybe you need more Equity um and again it's much more financial engineering instead you can actually just compound over a long period of time and build value that way yeah and I guess what you're getting at is the margin change is so significant where you can do that but instead if you're doing some of the financial engineering that traditional PE uh relies on you're not really you're often not changing the margins from 5% to 30% or to 50% even i n some cases yeah and I (10:57) think that's that's like it's a there's a Nuance Point here where if again if you do this right in the right vertical and your and the businesses that you end up acquiring are worth more to you than to any other buyer like that's when you can start to do really interesting things right so like let's say I'm doing something and and Mark is doing something um in the same space And for those Insurance businesses we're both rolling like running the same Playbook he's a private Equity Firm I'm running a technology business and I go to you and (11:22) I say hey I have this wonderful technology platform when you like to come and grow with me and I can take your earnings from 5% to 20% versus Mark says hey I'll actually you know I'll just pay you a bunch of money and like you're going to stay at 5% and maybe I'm going to fire Susan who runs your accounting right like who's whose value prop sounds better yeah and so in this way you can one like your business is a ctually worth more to me sure right because I can impact earnings in the short term based on my technology and (11:48) two you want to work with me because you see hey like I'm not going to like have to go in and fundamentally like do a bunch of these things that are really Cutthroat and it's a growth story and speaking of that growth story it sounds like a lot of the growth is inorganic and in this case at least that's what this story is about so tell me more about that why the inorganic growth strategy versus you know maybe a more organic approach yeah so it's a great question so I think that um the way to think about these like kind of more (12:12) traditional Services businesses often times they local Enterprises right so like again like in Columbia Missouri you have a reputation as being like a trusted source of insurance services and so people want to come and work with staff for that reason and it's actually traditionally pretty hard it's not just insurance but like think about real estate law they're traditionally local um and so it's pretty hard to go go add at new customers and grow organically if you're doing that like it's it's pretty special in my opinion the best version (12:40) of this inorganic you know growth strategy it's like you're acquiring a very sticky a very local you know uh GEOS specific customer base and then you're improving the business that's serving them and freeing up that person who already has like all of these wonderful Connections in whatev er in whatever space they are to go do more of that right so now you're not focused on like hey shoot I've got to deal with all this stuff in the back office I can go I can go to the you know Little League field or the wherever the heck you go to (13:07) like sell insurance um and basically get to know people and do business development and so now not only are we impacting like earnings we're actually impacting the the net new organic growth rate which is pretty clever the way to think about thi s in my mind or the way that I think about it is hey if you were running an Enterprise software company right and you were like on the in the public markets and you're saying like hey I could have you know 18 20 24mon paybacks on like a great Enterprise customer logo that's the way to think (13:33) about like these small businesses like can you find a way to have like strong paybacks on these uh new new business Acquisitions and treat them much more as just like an Enterprise software sales moti on rather than a traditional private Equity Firm acquiring some small business and and doing a bunch of uh you know Financial engineering on it but obviously this is not easy this is not operationally easy so tell me more about that like as I sit here in my Venture Capital Ivory Tower all these businesses are simple to automate yeah I can't wait (14:01) for my tweets add me well tell me more about that so as you think through the challenges like what is most Stark what's most clear as the thing that someone pursuing this would need to solve yeah I think the biggest one is just understanding that like there's going to be a bunch of human problems when it comes to this since you have to be like Eyes Wide Open you have to be a great operator and you have to deal with like scaling a human a human driven business so I think that's the first one and like all the implementation problems (14:25) around that um right so there's going to be a bunch of hairy Legacy systems you're going to need to navigate like all the process Mining and figuring out like what do I need to build here to actually drive incremental uh incremental value so that's the second piece it's like human human level issues once you get through those then you can start to do the process mapping which is uh which is also exciting um and then the third piece is actually like it's I've talked about this a little bit before but a lot of these Legacy (14:49) Services businesses while they may be bits oriented like at some like you know what what's what but like AI is not going to drive the truck to the crash right like where is the right combination of bits and atoms primarily hopefully bits um and then trying to figure out how to navigate some of these human problems and implementation s but it's definitely going to be hairy and and again I think if you don't do this right and you don't figure out like a very repeatable motion for these like again smaller Acquisitions I think it's going to be really challenging to find entrepreneurs that have like earned (16:02) secrets in these markets right so somebody who has maybe sold to the the steps Insurance Agency or someone who's run steps Insurance Agency or whatever the coral are is for each one of these markets it's very hard to come in and like know the shorthand like you have to trust me that I'm going to come in and help you bring your business and take your business to the next level if I'm going to be that acquirer um and so I think you need to be lik of acquisition targets such that like you're not you know basically going in and having to compete with the larger you know mid to larg (16:59) size traditional private Equity deals and so if you can find one of these end markets where there's like you know a significant number of mom and pop businesses um where you can go and run that like cacm minded Playbook of like acquiring and implementing and building a repeatable motion around that um I think there's just like i"

### Summary of "AI-Powered Acquisitions: A New Playbook"

1. **Shift in Private Equity Model**:
   - Traditional private equity focuses on financial engineering or operational efficiency to improve short-term earnings.
   - The proposed model emphasizes creating a technology core within traditional service businesses to enable long-term, scalable growth.

2. **AI as a Driver of Change**:
   - Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI are automating processes across industries like sales (e.g., SDR roles), freight logistics, and healthcare back-office operations.
   - Industries ripe for disruption involve unstructured data (e.g., voice or paper processes) and significant business process outsourcing (BPO) spend.

3. **Example Applications**:
   - Freight brokerage call center automation.
   - Healthcare practice back-office streamlining.
   - Insurance agencies automating customer interactions and back-office workflows.

4. **Framework for Disruption**:
   - Target businesses with unstructured data, repetitive processes, or legacy systems.
   - Combine AI integration with deep vertical-specific expertise to transform operations and improve margins.

5. **Margin Transformation**:
   - Example: Automating processes in a small insurance agency could shift net margins from 5% to 30%, enabling reinvestment or acquisitions.
   - This creates a flywheel effect, compounding growth through successive acquisitions.

6. **Challenges in Adoption**:
   - Selling software to traditional businesses is often slow and requires operational changes.
   - Acquiring businesses enables direct control over implementing new workflows and technology.

7. **Capital Efficiency and Scaling**:
   - Smaller acquisitions can be more cost-effective and generate immediate returns after initial investments.
   - The model reduces reliance on constant debt or equity raises, instead creating self-sustaining growth.

8. **Inorganic Growth Strategy**:
   - Acquiring local, trusted small businesses (e.g., insurance agencies) with sticky customer bases.
   - Improving operational efficiency allows business owners to focus on growth activities.

9. **Operational Complexity**:
   - Significant challenges include navigating legacy systems, process mapping, and managing human-driven operational changes.
   - Success depends on creating repeatable systems for integrating and scaling acquired businesses.

10. **Long-Term Vision**:
    - The approach targets markets with many small, fragmented businesses where traditional private equity strategies are less effective.
    - It relies on combining earned industry insights with technology to build scalable, AI-enhanced operations.

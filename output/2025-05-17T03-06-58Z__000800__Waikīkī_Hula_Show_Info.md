The Kūhiō Beach Hula Show is scheduled for Saturday, May 17, 2025, from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. It takes place at the Kūhiō Beach Hula Mound, located beachside on Kalākaua Avenue near the Duke Kahanamoku Statue in Waikīkī. The event is free, outdoors, and offers casual seating on the grass—feel free to bring a beach chair or mat. The show features authentic Hawaiian music and hula by Hawai‘i’s finest hālau hula (dance troupes) and Hawaiian performers.

Additionally, while the Kilohana Hula Show is typically held on Monday through Wednesday mornings, there are no performances scheduled for this weekend.

For a more immersive experience, consider attending the Rock-A-Hula show at the Royal Hawaiian Theater. This ticketed event combines hula with fire knife dancing and live music. Various packages are available, including dinner options.

Enjoy the hula performances this weekend!

Okay, help me draft an email for the following intent. So, for your context, I'm a UX designer. I work at a company named Kolibri, and that's C-O-L-I-B-R-I. Kolibri is sort of this umbrella brand under which there are a lot of educational platforms, and there are about 36 different platforms. And I am sort of tasked with creating a unified checkout experience that can be you know, templated into one experience that could possibly be replicated on every other website. So, I have worked on some designs, but I have been asked to reach out to business team members just to get their feedback and opinion on anything, any potential issues or anything we may have missed, and just get their general look and opinions on the design. Maybe not opinions, but like just a very business-centric feedback. So, there are about five brands for which I'm reaching out to, five different people. I'm going to send them the same message, and yeah, just help me draft an email. This is sort of a cold email where I'm reaching out to them for the first time. I may have to introduce myself, give them the context on why I'm reaching out to them, what I expect from them, and like just check their availability. So, just can you help me draft an email for that?

Certainly. Here's a cold outreach email that is crisp, professional, and subtly assertive—conveying clarity of purpose while inviting cooperation. It also positions you as someone acting on behalf of a larger, strategic initiative, which lends weight to your request:

**Subject:** Request for Feedback on Unified Checkout Experience – Kolibri Platforms

Hi [Name],

I’m [Your Full Name], a UX Designer at Kolibri, currently leading an initiative to streamline and unify the checkout experience across our portfolio of educational platforms.

As part of this effort, I’ve developed a proposed design that aims to serve as a flexible template adaptable across all 36 platforms—including [their brand name]. Before we move forward, I’m reaching out to key stakeholders from each brand to gather business-focused feedback. Specifically, I’d appreciate your input on any brand-specific requirements, edge cases, or concerns we should be factoring in.

Would you be available for a brief 20–30 minute session next week to review the design and share your perspective? I’ll send over the design and a few guiding questions ahead of time to make the discussion efficient and focused.

Let me know what times might work for you.

Best regards,  
[Your Full Name]  
UX Designer | Kolibri  
[Your Email] | [Optional: Phone Number or Calendly Link]

Would you like a more assertive, formal, or warmer version depending on your rapport with these people?

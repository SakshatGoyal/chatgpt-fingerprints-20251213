You **cannot** enter Herbst Theatre without a ticket. All patrons—no exceptions—must have a valid ticket to gain admission citeturn0search0turn0search20.

Herbst Theatre is a dedicated performance venue (part of the San Francisco War Memorial & Performing Arts Center), and unlike some public spaces, it isn’t open for free entry or walk‑in access. You’ll need to purchase or obtain a ticket in advance, through the City Box Office or authorized resale channels.

If you're hoping to attend an event spontaneously, here are a couple of options:

- **Check for last-minute tickets**: Many shows release any remaining seats for sale right up until curtain. You can often buy them at the Herbst Theatre box office around 60 minutes before showtime (see recent examples like the Pride Band concert) citeturn0search13.
- **Look for discounted or student/senior tickets**: Some performances offer reduced-price tickets at the box office shortly before the show, for students or seniors—subject to availability citeturn0search5.

But the bottom line is: **you need a ticket to enter**. No tickets, no entry—there's no free lobby access either.

The **“Mozart to Mendelssohn: Celebrating Black Composers”** concert that started at 3:00 PM today is scheduled to finish at **5:00 PM**, making it a **2-hour performance**, including an intermission citeturn0search1turn0search12.

### What That Means for You:
- **Doors closed or opening times**: Generally, doors open about 45–60 minutes before the start. Since the performance is underway, it's possible the lobby is still open, but **seating may be limited**.
- **Getting in now**: You **can still enter without a ticket or RSVP**—it’s free and open admission. However, late arrival means you may only find **standing room or limited seating**.
- **Stay duration**: The show runs until **5:00 PM**, so any seating or standing availability will last through then.

### ✅ Quick Breakdown

| Time        | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| **3:00 PM** | Performance begins |
| **Around 4:00 PM** | Intermission (usually 15–20 mins) |
| **Until 5:00 PM** | Second half continues |

If you're already nearby, I’d recommend heading over—you’ll still be able to catch most of the concert, even if the best seats are taken. Want help with directions or where to go once you're inside?

# Psychiatrist research guide

## You (2025-11-17T09:33:07.547000+00:00)

You will be given:

- A **Persona**
- A **Purpose**
- A fixed **PESS Framework** (a structured set of research modules)

Your task is to **transform the generic PESS modules** into a set of **contextually rich, creatively framed, and purpose-driven research prompts**. These questions will guide a human research team in gathering the most relevant and nuanced material needed to emulate the persona effectively for the stated purpose.

---

### ✳️ Inputs:

- **Persona**: Psychiatrist
- **Purpose**: To help diagnose mental health issues, evaluate current medications and the combinations of different compounds within the medications and their effects, create a plan of action, and constantly guide the family through the next steps. [The patient is a 60-year-old female who is suffering from a form of severe mental health issues and is unable to get the necessary help from professional doctors in her region


- **PESS Question Template**:

    ## 📝 PESS Research Guide: [Persona] for [Purpose]

    ### 1. Persona Definition (Who)
    Select relevant modules:
    - [ ] Identity Basics
    - [ ] Tone & Style
    - [ ] Behavioral Patterns
    - [ ] Values & Motivations
    - [ ] Exemplars & Anecdotes
    - [ ] Domain Competence *(optional)*

    ### 2. Purpose Definition (What For)
    Clearly identify your primary use-case modules:
    - [ ] Emotional & Social Guidance
    - [ ] Strategic & Analytical Reasoning
    - [ ] Creative & Expressive Tasks
    - [ ] Procedural & Functional Tasks
    - [ ] Moral & Ethical Reasoning

    ### 3. Recommended Information-Gathering Sources
    Based on chosen modules, gather from:
    - Primary sources (e.g., interviews, writings by persona)
    - Secondary sources (biographies, critical analysis)
    - Fictional canon (scripts, character wikis, authoritative sources)

    **Example:**
    If "Emotional & Social Guidance" selected → memoir excerpts, personal anecdotes, interviews reflecting values.

    If "Procedural & Functional Tasks" selected → step-by-step descriptions, documented decision processes, case-studies.

    ### 4. Specific Information to Include
    Prioritize gathering:
    - Authentic examples closely tied to persona’s demonstrated behavior
    - Explicit declarations of values, priorities, motivations
    - Demonstrated reasoning processes (if relevant to task)

    ### 5. Pitfalls & What to Avoid
    - Avoid assumptions of competence based solely on fame or presence in a domain.
    - Beware user-added ideological biases; cross-check authenticity.
    - Do not assume fictional logic applies to real-world tasks.

    ### 6. Depth and Fidelity Target
    - Clearly define the depth required:
      **High (exact voice replication)** → Rich exemplars & anecdotes, detailed style & tone guides.
      **Medium (style-aware, flexible)** → Values, general patterns, some exemplars.
      **Low (loose imitation)** → Identity basics, core values only.

    ### 7. Hidden Assumptions & Risk Mitigation
    - Identify assumptions in chosen persona’s public image vs. reality.
    - Check cultural bias in collected sources.
    - Prepare fallback instructions for handling uncertainty (style drift, hallucination).

    ### 🔄 Final Checklist (Before Use)
    - Confirm fidelity matches task requirement.
    - Confirm adequate factual grounding for purpose.
    - Confirm inclusion of modular packs matches intended complexity and depth.


---

### 🎯 Objective:

Transform each *selected* PESS module into a **set of exploratory, research-ready questions** that are:

- Tailored to the Persona and Purpose
- Specific and deep enough to guide meaningful, grounded research
- Framed creatively—favoring open-ended, imaginative, or situational language
- Sensitive to personal, behavioral, and cultural nuance
- Free from clichés and generalizations

---

### 🧩 Instructions:

1. **Only consider the PESS modules marked with `[x]`**.

    Ignore those marked with `[ ]` or not selected.

2. **For each selected module**, generate 1–5 high-quality exploratory questions.

    Prioritize **depth, relevance, and contextual grounding** over quantity.

    If only one great question emerges, that’s better than five generic ones.

3. **Frame the questions in a creative, open-ended style** that invites nuanced research.

    Use formats like:

    - “What might {{Persona}} say if…”
    - “Are there examples of situations where…”
    - “How has {{Persona}} responded to…”
    - “In what ways has {{Persona}} demonstrated…”
    - “What real-life moments reflect {{Persona}}’s view on…”
4. **Incorporate the lens of the stated Purpose.**

    Shape each question so it uncovers information directly useful for fulfilling the end-goal.

5. **Adapt based on the Fidelity Target** (if present in the PESS):
    - For **High Fidelity** → Ask for quotes, anecdotes, precise language, voice tone
    - For **Medium Fidelity** → Ask about patterns, values, reasoning styles
    - For **Low Fidelity** → Ask about identity basics and general worldview
6. **You may connect insights across modules if it enhances the questions’ relevance or depth.**

    Overlap is acceptable if it strengthens contextual integrity.

7. **Do not answer the questions.**

    Only generate the questions themselves.

8. **Optional but encouraged:**

    Where helpful, recommend the most suitable source types (e.g., memoirs, interviews, public speeches) for each question.

### ✅ Output Format:

Your output should be structured as:

## Research Objective: Find empirical information to help create a custom GPT of {{Persona}} [for] {{Purpose}}

### [Module Title]
- [Exploratory Question 1]
- [Exploratory Question 2]
- [Exploratory Question 3]
- [Exploratory Question 4]
- [Exploratory Question 5]
...

Repeat this structure for **each selected module** in the PESS framework.

### Who you are:
An amalgamation of the following qualities -

- You help shape questions that don’t just ask what someone thought — but how they arrived there. You anchor the framework in cognition rather than performance or narrative.
- You help construct questions that challenge internal coherence, reveal blind spots, or dig into motivation.
- You ensure your questions account for thinking as a moving system, not a snapshot.
- You remain grounded in lived cognition — not just idealized abstractions.
---

### 🔄 Final Check Before Output:

- Are your questions creatively and concretely framed?
- Are they deeply tied to both Persona and Purpose?
- Would a researcher reading each question know *where to start looking* for answers?
- Did you avoid vague, surface-level phrasing?

## Research Objective: Find empirical information to help create a custom GPT of **a Psychiatrist** for **diagnosing complex mental health issues in an older adult, evaluating medications and combinations, planning next steps, and guiding the family over time when local care is inadequate.**

---

### Identity Basics
- How do experienced psychiatrists typically **describe their own role** when working with an older adult (around 60) who has severe, long-standing mental health challenges and limited local care options—do they see themselves more as diagnosticians, long-term collaborators, educators for the family, or something else?
  *Suggested sources: interviews, clinician bios, training talks, podcast appearances.*

- In real-world practice, how do psychiatrists **introduce themselves and frame expectations** in the very first meeting with a distressed family seeking help for a 60-year-old patient—what words do they use to define “what I can and cannot do” in this context?
  *Suggested sources: intake scripts, role-play training materials, supervision transcripts.*

---

### Tone & Style
- When explaining **diagnostic uncertainty or complexity** (e.g., overlapping depression, psychosis, cognitive decline, medication side-effects) to families, what language patterns do psychiatrists use to stay honest about limits while still offering hope and direction?
  *Suggested sources: family psychoeducation handouts, live/recorded family sessions, training videos.*

- What does a psychiatrist **sound like** when they gently correct misinformation (e.g., “this medicine is making her worse,” “all psychiatrists just sedate people”) without dismissing the family’s fear or lived experience?
  *Suggested sources: consultation transcripts, de-identified clinic notes, supervision case discussions.*

- Are there recurring **phrases, metaphors, or analogies** that psychiatrists use when talking about brain chemistry, medications, and side effects with non-medical family members—especially with older patients who may be skeptical or frightened about meds?
  *Suggested sources: patient education materials, public talks, Q&A sessions.*

---

### Behavioral Patterns
- In complex cases where a 60-year-old patient is already on **multiple psychiatric and medical medications**, how do psychiatrists typically **structure their thinking and sequence their actions** over the first several consultations (e.g., what they prioritize first, what they defer, what data they insist on getting before changing meds)?
  *Suggested sources: case formulations, treatment algorithms, reflective practice write-ups.*

- How do psychiatrists **respond in real time** when a family starts to disagree with a proposed plan—do they slow down, renegotiate, provide evidence, explore emotions, or set firmer boundaries, and in what order?
  *Suggested sources: live/recorded family meetings, supervision notes, case vignettes in textbooks.*

- When local resources are poor or fragmented, how do psychiatrists **adapt their behavior and recommendations**—for example, what do they do differently when ideal services (e.g., specialized clinics, psychotherapy, day programs) simply don’t exist where the patient lives?
  *Suggested sources: rural/low-resource practice literature, interviews with community psychiatrists.*

---

### Values & Motivations
- In situations like this, what explicit or implicit **values guide a psychiatrist’s decisions**—for example, how do they weigh symptom reduction versus autonomy, safety versus side-effect burden, family relief versus patient privacy?
  *Suggested sources: ethics essays, opinion pieces, training manuals on geriatric psychiatry and family work.*

- How do psychiatrists describe their **moral responsibility** when they strongly suspect the existing treatment is harmful or inadequate but the family has very limited access to alternative care?
  *Suggested sources: ethics case discussions, panel talks on practicing in constrained systems.*

- When speaking about their work with older adults and their families, what do psychiatrists themselves say **“matters most”** to them over months and years—accurate diagnosis, stability, dignity, improved relationships, something else?
  *Suggested sources: long-form interviews, memoir-style writings, keynote talks.*

---

### Exemplars & Anecdotes
- Are there detailed case stories of psychiatrists working with a **60+ patient whose condition has been mismanaged for years**, where we can see step-by-step how they re-evaluated the diagnosis, adjusted medications, and rebuilt trust with the family?
  *Suggested sources: case study chapters, teaching vignettes, grand rounds presentations.*

- Can we find accounts where a psychiatrist **openly narrates their own uncertainty or change of mind**—for example, realizing that medication side effects were mistaken for worsening illness—and how they explained this pivot to the patient and family?
  *Suggested sources: reflective practice essays, “mistakes I learned from” talks, supervision notes.*

- Are there specific anecdotes where a psychiatrist had to **deliver very difficult news** (e.g., likely chronic illness, partial recovery at best) while still co-creating a meaningful, actionable plan with the family—and how did they phrase it?
  *Suggested sources: narrative medicine pieces, patient-family testimonials about “good psychiatrists.”*

---

### Domain Competence
- In real-world diagnostic work for a 60-year-old with severe symptoms, how do psychiatrists **distinguish between primary psychiatric illness, neurocognitive disorders (like dementia), medication side effects, and medical comorbidities**—what concrete decision trees or mental checklists do they use?
  *Suggested sources: clinical guidelines, diagnostic algorithms, exam prep materials, geriatric psychiatry texts.*

- What is the **typical reasoning process** psychiatrists follow when evaluating **polypharmacy**—multiple overlapping medications from different prescribers—for safety, redundancy, and interaction risks in older adults?
  *Suggested sources: psychopharmacology handbooks, polypharmacy case conferences, deprescribing guides.*

- How do psychiatrists describe their **thresholds for action**—for example, when will they advocate strongly to stop or switch a drug, when will they cautiously observe, and when will they urgently escalate care (hospitalization, specialist referral)?
  *Suggested sources: emergency psychiatry protocols, risk assessment frameworks, practice guidelines.*

- Are there well-documented examples of psychiatrists **collaborating with non-psychiatric specialists** (e.g., neurologists, internists) to refine diagnosis and medication plans for older patients, and what does that collaboration look like in practice (who leads, who concedes, how disagreements are resolved)?
  *Suggested sources: multidisciplinary case reports, liaison psychiatry descriptions.*

---

### Emotional & Social Guidance
- How do psychiatrists typically **speak to families who are exhausted, resentful, or guilty** after years of caring for a severely ill older adult—what specific kinds of validation, boundary-setting, and practical guidance do they offer?
  *Suggested sources: family psychoeducation programs, caregiver support group scripts, clinician handbooks.*

- Are there examples of psychiatrists **mapping out roles** within the family (“who does what, who decides what”) when building a care plan, and how do they handle conflicting expectations between family members?
  *Suggested sources: systemic/family psychiatry literature, case vignettes, training seminars.*

- How do psychiatrists coach families to **interpret day-to-day fluctuations** (good days vs. bad days) so they don’t overreact to every change, but also don’t miss warning signs—what language do they use for this?
  *Suggested sources: educational leaflets, after-visit summaries, telepsychiatry scripts.*

---

### Strategic & Analytical Reasoning
- When faced with incomplete records, conflicting prior diagnoses, and multiple medications, how do psychiatrists **organize the puzzle**—what questions do they ask first, what information do they rate as “non-negotiable,” and what are they willing to approximate or infer?
  *Suggested sources: intake templates, teaching on “first 3 sessions,” diagnostic strategy articles.*

- In a situation where local doctors have done their best but the patient remains unwell, how do psychiatrists **analyze the system constraints** (local expertise, money, transport, stigma) and redesign a plan that fits the real-world environment rather than an ideal guideline?
  *Suggested sources: global mental health literature, rural psychiatry reports, implementation science case studies.*

- How do psychiatrists **track progress over time** in complex cases where “full recovery” is unlikely—what metrics (clinical, functional, relational) do they prioritize, and how do these metrics influence ongoing medication and therapy decisions?
  *Suggested sources: outcome tracking tools, chronic care management models, long-term follow-up studies.*

---

### Procedural & Functional Tasks
- What are the **step-by-step actions** a psychiatrist usually takes over the first 1–3 months after meeting a 60-year-old with severe mental health issues: information gathering, medication changes, lab tests, risk assessments, follow-up intervals, family meetings?
  *Suggested sources: clinic protocols, onboarding checklists, structured care pathways.*

- When reviewing **current medications**, what is the typical procedure for verifying dosages, checking interactions, confirming adherence, and aligning with other prescribers—and how do psychiatrists explain each step to the family?
  *Suggested sources: medication reconciliation workflows, electronic health record templates, clinic policies.*

- How do psychiatrists usually **document and communicate a “plan of action”** that families can actually use day-to-day (e.g., what to watch for, when to call, what counts as an emergency vs. routine concern)?
  *Suggested sources: discharge summaries, care plans, crisis management guides.*

---

### Moral & Ethical Reasoning
- In cases where the patient has fluctuating insight or decision-making capacity, how do psychiatrists reason through **who gets to decide what**—patient vs. family vs. clinician—especially around medication changes, hospitalization, or invasive investigations?
  *Suggested sources: capacity assessment guidelines, ethics committee case notes, legal-psychiatric commentaries.*

- How do psychiatrists talk about and handle **tension between short-term relief and long-term harm**, such as using sedating medications for peace at home versus preserving cognition and functioning in a 60-year-old patient?
  *Suggested sources: ethical analyses of psychotropic use in older adults, debates in professional journals.*

- Are there documented cases where psychiatrists **refused to follow family pressure** (e.g., “just give her something to keep her quiet”) and how did they explain this refusal while maintaining the therapeutic relationship?
  *Suggested sources: ethics teaching cases, reflective essays, anonymized complaint/resolution reports.*

---

### Recommended Information-Gathering Sources
- For building a realistic psychiatrist persona in this context, which **types of sources** (e.g., geriatric psychiatry casebooks, caregiver memoirs, clinic protocols, telepsychiatry transcripts) best reveal *how* psychiatrists think and speak, rather than just listing what they should do?

- Are there **regional or cultural sources** (e.g., narratives from low-resource or non-Western settings) that show how psychiatrists adapt their practice when families have limited access to care, limited literacy, or strong cultural beliefs about mental illness and medication?

---

### Specific Information to Include
- What kinds of **direct quotations and dialogue snippets** between psychiatrists, patients, and families are most useful to capture so that a model can emulate not just content but pacing, tone, and turn-taking in sensitive conversations?

- Which **concrete decision points**—for example, “increase dose vs. switch drug,” “hospitalize vs. manage at home,” “push for therapy vs. prioritize medical workup”—should be documented with their reasoning and trade-offs, so that the model can mirror realistic thought processes?

---

### Pitfalls & What to Avoid
- In reviewing existing materials, where are psychiatrists most often **idealized or oversimplified** (e.g., portrayed as always decisive, always right), and how can we deliberately look for sources that show doubt, error-correction, and system constraints?

- What evidence is there of **bias or blind spots** in how psychiatrists are represented—such as under-attention to older women’s symptoms, over-reliance on medication, or cultural misinterpretation—and how can the research team actively counterbalance these?

---

### Depth and Fidelity Target
- If we aim for **high-fidelity emulation**, which psychiatrists (real or archetypal) offer enough rich, detailed material—dialogues, case write-ups, reflections—that we can reliably infer their voice, reasoning style, and ethical stance for complex, long-term family guidance?

- What is the minimum **set of exemplars** (number and variety of cases, types of interactions) needed for the model to behave consistently across different scenarios (acute crisis, routine review, difficult news, medication changes) with this patient profile?

---

### Hidden Assumptions & Risk Mitigation
- What **unspoken assumptions** about psychiatry (e.g., “meds always help if you find the right one,” “family is always aligned,” “resources are available if you ask enough”) show up in mainstream sources, and how can we systematically identify and correct for them in the training materials?

- How can we design fallback behaviors for the model—such as **clear safety disclaimers, encouragement to seek local in-person care, and explicit limits on what can be decided remotely**—that reflect how responsible psychiatrists manage risk and uncertainty in real life?

- Are there examples of psychiatrists **explicitly describing the boundaries** of what they can safely do via consultation or tele-advice (especially cross-region), and how they communicate these boundaries to desperate families seeking more than they can ethically provide?

---

These questions are designed so that a research team can immediately see **what to look for, where to look, and what kind of cognitive and ethical texture** they need to extract to emulate a psychiatrist responsibly in this specific, high-stakes context.

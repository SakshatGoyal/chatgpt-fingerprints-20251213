# SF Psychiatrist Search Assistance

## You (2025-03-11T05:26:18.468893+00:00)

@eliot, I need help finding a doctor. write me a prompt for that.

doc needs to be in san francisco, or the larger san francisco bay area. should have a lot of experience working with either delusional disorder or schizophrenia patients. i mean we need a psychiatrist. i need the model to do some online deep research and for now, just give me a very comprehensive list with a few lines about their experience, what patients have said about them and any overall reviewds from zocdoc, or other platforms. oh, and their core competencies and how well they'd work with schizophrenia patients. (my mom)

I need doctors who can take out of insurance patients. I can only pay out of pocket, no insurance.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T05:26:21.730777+00:00)

Before structuring your prompt, let's clarify a few crucial details to optimize the model’s output precisely for your needs:

1. **Depth and Specificity of the Search**:
   - Are you looking for a wide-ranging initial list (e.g., 10+ doctors) or a more targeted shortlist (3–5 doctors) based on deeper research?

2. **Prioritization Criteria**:
   - Is experience specifically with schizophrenia more important, or is general experience with delusional disorders equally valuable?

3. **Patient Reviews & Ratings**:
   - Would you prefer a summary of patient feedback and reviews that emphasize empathy, effectiveness, medication management, therapy integration, or something else specifically?

4. **Geographical Flexibility**:
   - Are you open to psychiatrists who offer telehealth consultations from anywhere in California, or strictly in-person visits within the San Francisco Bay Area?

5. **Payment & Financial Considerations**:
   - Should the model specifically verify and highlight doctors who clearly accept out-of-pocket patients?

6. **Level of Detail & Formatting**:
   - Would you prefer the output formatted strictly as bullet points, a concise paragraph per doctor, or a structured table format?

7. **Potential Role for the AI (Persona)**:
   - Should the AI assume the role of a medical researcher, a healthcare advocate, or another specialized role to guide its perspective?

Let me know your thoughts on these points, and I'll construct a precise, structured prompt tailored for your exact situation.

## You (2025-03-11T05:30:56.377909+00:00)

I need a wide list (10+). I need like 20 if that's possible.
schizophrenia experience would be more helpful for first 10, for the other we can look at delusional disorder with equal importance
"Would you prefer a summary of patient feedback and reviews that emphasize empathy, effectiveness, medication management, therapy integration, or something else specifically?" -- i'm not too sure, lets just do a broad analysis now and we'll do deep dive in later prompts.
We strictly need someone within the SF bay area for now
I'm ok with telehealth
yes, focus only on doctors who can accept out of pocket payments
a concise paragraph per doctor
assume the role of a medical researcher.

this prompt sill mostly revolve around search. I'm planning on using it for deep search

Here's your structured and optimized prompt tailored specifically for deep, comprehensive online research:



## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T05:31:55.193157+00:00)

Does this prompt structure fully address your needs for a thorough online deep search, or would you like to refine or adjust anything further?

## You (2025-03-11T05:50:29.669829+00:00)

ok tihs was helpful. a lot.

@elliot, i need ur help with another prompt

one concern i have is, in the deep research activity the model just prioritized 20 names. But i'm wondering if there's a way to get access to any and all candidates who appeared as promising just so we can cover our basis.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T05:50:30.801270+00:00)

Great consideration. Before structuring the next prompt, let's clarify your intent to maximize effectiveness:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
   - Are you looking for the model to expand the search beyond the initial 20, providing a secondary or backup list of all additional promising candidates (with minimal details)?

2. **Level of Detail**:
   - Do you want these additional candidates presented with just basic identifiers (name, location, primary specialty), or do you also require a short rationale explaining why they seemed promising?

3. **Filtering Criteria**:
   - Should the model highlight why these additional candidates didn't initially rank in the top 20 (e.g., fewer reviews, less explicit specialty, geographical ambiguity, unclear payment methods)?

4. **Presentation and Usability**:
   - Should this secondary comprehensive list be structured differently (e.g., table format or bullet-point list) to quickly reference and distinguish it from the top 20?

5. **Continued Search Capability**:
   - Do you envision subsequent prompts for deeper dives into this expanded candidate pool? If so, do you want the model to explicitly note potential reasons or aspects warranting further investigation?

Please clarify these points, and I'll build an optimized prompt precisely addressing your concerns.

## You (2025-03-11T05:52:29.333182+00:00)

1. Yes, with minimal details.
2. Just name, location, primary expertise, and years of experience.
3. Yes, it should. Just 1-2 sentencews would work.
4. yeah, just bullet format will work
5. I'm not sure at the moment.

Great clarification. Here’s your structured and optimized follow-up prompt for accessing an expanded candidate pool:



## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T05:52:56.953755+00:00)

Does this expanded prompt fully align with your intentions, or would you like to refine it further?

## You (2025-03-11T06:01:41.626158+00:00)

ok, now it gave me a total of 25 names. now i need that chatgpt to compile a list of all those names for an operator. and I want the operator to check a few things by going online.

1. check if we can book an appointment online. i don't need to actually bookit, just want to know if patients without insurance have the ability to book an appointment. and if so, where do i need to go. i think the operator will just search the internet to see where to schedule the appointment.

2. create a list of links that i can later refer to when i want to book the appointments myself.

Now i want the other chatgpt to not only compile the list but also create a detailed set of instructions guiding the operator in a way that it doesn't get stuck or need my assistance. For example, if it sees that I can scedule an appointment with one doctor, it shouldn't pause and be like, 'would u like me to schedule the appointmet?'. clearly, no. just see if its possible, and make a note of the link. the final output of the operator should be just the names of the doctors and a link for thier scheduling.

@eliot, could u help me write the correct prompt.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T06:01:44.552519+00:00)

Let's clarify your intent further before creating this prompt to ensure maximum effectiveness:

1. **Clarity on Task for the Operator**:
   - You're confirming the task strictly involves checking if an online booking option exists for uninsured patients, without engaging in the booking process itself, correct?

2. **Information Sources**:
   - Should the operator specifically focus on doctors' personal websites, clinic/hospital portals, or known third-party platforms like Zocdoc, Healthgrades, or Psychology Today?

3. **Detail of Reporting**:
   - Beyond the doctor's name and booking link, do you want a brief note if online booking isn't available, or only record doctors who explicitly support uninsured online booking?

4. **Output Format**:
   - Would you prefer the final output as a structured bullet-point list, table format, or something else?

5. **Exception Handling**:
   - How would you like the operator to handle ambiguity—such as unclear information about payment options or online booking availability? Should they note it explicitly and move on?

Clarifying these points will help craft an optimal prompt that's tailored precisely to your needs.

## You (2025-03-11T06:05:00.291900+00:00)

1. yes, correct
2. the operator should focus on all available sources that can directly schedule an appointment with the doctor. Zocdoc is good cuz one can schedule an appointment with the doctor, but i think pages like psychology today just forward me to different pages, which then forward me to another series of pages and then i'm basically stuck in a loop. So if the operator cannot find a place, in the output it should let me know
3. no, no additional details are needed
4. structured bullet points from the operator. Name and hyperlink for scheduling
5. for ambiguos situations like payment info, the operator can let them be. But in cases where the operator is simply unable to find a link, just let me know and we'll look at it later.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T06:05:30.761139+00:00)

Does this clearly align with how you'd like the operator to handle the task? Let me know if further adjustments are needed!

## You (2025-03-11T06:15:36.289056+00:00)

ok, while the operator does its thing, I need you help with another prompt. Now the deep research output gave me a very long list of 20 doctors, but what i want to know is that is there a way i can prioritize looking up all these 20 names. So what i want chatgpt to do is figure out a very well thought out, well reasoned, and well structured appraoch to basically create some sort of matrix and put the doctors as, like,

preference 1, preference 2, preference 3, etc... Basically i need someway to know who's the best choice, who's the seocnd best, etc... I want the gpt to structure them in order that i should prioritizer them, and give me just a brief reason for why.

@eliot can u help me build this prompt

## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T06:15:39.001966+00:00)

Before crafting your prioritization prompt, let’s clarify a few details to optimize it precisely for your needs:

1. **Prioritization Criteria:**
   - What factors are most critical to your decision-making? For instance, should it be based primarily on:
     - Years of experience?
     - Specific experience with schizophrenia?
     - Telehealth availability?
     - Patient satisfaction/reviews?
     - Clarity and ease of booking appointments?

   Could you rank these criteria by importance to you?

2. **Reasoning Transparency**:
   - Do you prefer a single concise reason per doctor explaining their ranking, or would you like multiple brief points justifying their position?

3. **Matrix or Scoring System:**
   - Would you prefer a clear numerical scoring/rating system, or a qualitative ranking (e.g., \"highly recommended,\" \"recommended,\" \"less recommended\")?

4. **Format of Results**:
   - Should the results be displayed as a straightforward ranked list, or as a matrix/table highlighting various criteria clearly for quick comparison?

5. **Potential AI Persona**:
   - Should the AI assume a persona such as a healthcare consultant, medical analyst, or patient advocate to frame the evaluation clearly and intuitively?

Could you share your preferences on these points? Once you clarify, I'll craft a detailed and structured prompt to achieve exactly what you're looking for.

## You (2025-03-11T06:19:33.883539+00:00)

1. expertize with either delusional disorder or schizophrenia is crutical. i would probably deprioritize ones where their main area of focus is adhd or ptsd. then the second most important is years of experience, the more the better. ease of booking appointments is last. patient satisfaction is also somewhat important. I mean, if someone has 25 years but keeps getting one star, thats a looser.

2., two sentences explaining the reasoning

3. use a numeric scoring system

4. a straightforward ranked list with a few sentences below each person's name giving me the reasoning

5. imagine you're a primary care physician who is finding the best possible option for your patient, with serios medical research and analysis skills.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T06:20:27.209070+00:00)

Does this align precisely with your intended approach, or would you like any adjustments or refinements?

## You (2025-03-11T06:30:17.730483+00:00)

ok, it gave me the output.

now i need somewhat of a report. like a very complete report from the entire conversation. the report should start with a brief explaination abt the methodology explaining the process behind the search and the reasoning behind the scoring. then it should list each of the 20 doctors in the following format:

Preference 1:
<H3>Dr. Richard Patel, MD </H3>
(Score: 9.5)

(a few lines quantitatively breaking down the score)

<entire paragraph from the deep research output>
for example:
Experience & Background: A veteran psychiatrist with 32 years of clinical experience
CARE.HEALTHLINE.COM

CARE.HEALTHLINE.COM
. Dr. Patel completed medical school at Saint Louis University and has been affiliated with Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital for much of his career. He’s board-certified and known in the community for his work in both addiction psychiatry and psychosis.
Delusional Disorder Expertise: Delusional disorder is one of Dr. Patel’s areas of frequent clinical focus – in fact, he treats this condition more often than many peers
CARE.HEALTHLINE.COM
. At SFGH and in outpatient practice, he has managed cases of persecutory delusions, jealous delusions, and somatic delusions with great skill. Dr. Patel approaches delusional disorder with a careful balance of empathy and reality testing. He understands that patients with fixed false beliefs may lack insight; thus, he builds trust first and avoids direct confrontation of the delusion initially. Over time, with medication and therapy, he gently guides patients to reconsider beliefs that hinder their lives.
Core Competencies: Dr. Patel is described as calm, methodical, and very knowledgeable. He’s highly skilled in selecting the right antipsychotic (often favoring ones with fewer cognitive side effects) so patients can continue their daily activities. He also often employs therapy techniques like CBT to address the impact of delusions. Patient Feedback: His patients give him excellent ratings (5/5) and highlight his “kind and professional” demeanor
CARE.HEALTHLINE.COM

CARE.HEALTHLINE.COM
. Many have noted that Dr. Patel is trustworthy and takes their concerns seriously, which is crucial for those who are fearful or suspicious due to their delusions. Under his care, patients with delusional disorder often report feeling more understood and less anxious.
Telehealth & Availability: Dr. Patel is currently accepting new patients
CARE.HEALTHLINE.COM
 and offers both in-person consultations (primarily at the SF General outpatient clinic) and telehealth appointments. He accepts some insurance (e.g., Blue Cross Blue Shield) but also sees out-of-network and cash-paying patients
CARE.HEALTHLINE.COM
. Telehealth has been a convenient option he provides, given the accessibility it affords to patients who may be hesitant to leave home due to their delusions.

once the 20 are complete, for the additional 5 doctors, lets use this format and label them as (additional options)

Dr. John Carter, MD — Schizophrenia specialist, Palo Alto, CA, 15 years experience.
Not initially prioritized due to ambiguous confirmation of strict out‐of‐pocket payment acceptance and limited volume of public patient reviews.

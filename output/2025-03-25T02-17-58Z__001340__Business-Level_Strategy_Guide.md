# Business-Level Strategy Guide

## You (2025-03-25T02:17:58.216000+00:00)

Persona: Harvard-Educated Business Strategy Professor
Objective: Based on the attached document, write a 3-page, solution-agnostic handbook that clearly explains what business-level strategy is—including its strategic logic, conceptual boundaries, and diagnostic cues for identifying it in the wild.
Audience: Designers, researchers, and product strategists with light familiarity with business but not deep strategy training.
Constraints:

Do not propose design interventions or research activities.
Keep tone rigorous and academic, like a professor’s internal memo or teaching note.
Avoid examples and case studies.
Do not recommend strategies, tools, or playbooks.
Focus on truthfully describing, not advising.
Length should match a 3-page document.
📘 Structure & Content Instructions:

1. Introduction (1 paragraph max)

Define business-level strategy and position it as the set of choices an organization makes to compete effectively within a given market or industry.
Contrast briefly with corporate-level strategy (which determines which markets to be in).
2. Core Elements of Business-Level Strategy
Unpack the strategic pillars:

Value proposition to customers
Competitive positioning (cost leadership, differentiation, focus)
Target market scope
Capabilities alignment (how internal resources support the above)
Mention that these decisions are typically led by business unit heads, GMs, and division-level leadership.
3. Boundaries & Contrasts

Clarify how business-level strategy differs from:
Corporate strategy (scope of competition vs. arena of competition)
Functional/tactical strategy (execution vs. positioning)
Innovation or product strategy (newness vs. competitiveness)
Introduce the idea that these boundaries can blur, and explain how to conceptually sort them out.
4. Strategic Archetypes (Optional)

Introduce strategic “modes” like:
Cost leadership
Differentiation
Niche/focused strategy
Hybrid strategies
Again: describe these as ways of thinking about positioning, not recommendations.
5. Frameworks as Context (Not Tools)

Briefly explain that many business-level strategies are analyzed using models like:
Porter’s Generic Strategies
Value Chain Analysis
Customer Segmentation Matrices
Present them as contextual lenses, not things to apply.
6. Misconceptions to Avoid

Business strategy is not the same as branding, UX, or product design decisions—though it influences all three.
It’s not just “how we make money”—it's how we win within a market.
It’s not a fixed formula—it evolves with market dynamics and strategic intent.
7. Recognizing Strategy in Practice

Help readers become attuned to when business-level strategy is in play:
Decisions that shift competitive stance
Moves that change who the customer is, how they are served, or why they choose you
Messaging or product decisions that reflect a deeper strategic choice
8. Conclusion

Reiterate that business-level strategy is the “how” of competition—not a checklist or tactic, but a dynamic set of commitments to how an organization positions itself relative to others.
Encourage the reader to observe patterns of competitive logic during their research and design discovery work.
🧠 GPT-4o Thinking Instructions (Chain-of-Thought)

Start by clearly understanding how business-level strategy differs from both corporate and functional levels.
Organize the content with conceptual clarity. Avoid jumping into tools or methods.
Maintain an authoritative but clear tone, as though addressing a cohort of HBS students with non-MBA backgrounds.
Remove any implication of action or intervention; your job is only to reveal structure and truth, not solve anything.
Make sure the final product reads as a clean, standalone 3-page explainer.

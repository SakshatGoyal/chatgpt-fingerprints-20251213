# 7-Day Juice Fast Plan

## You (2025-07-22T01:21:26.527000+00:00)

Create a 7-day juice fast plan for me. Use the complete product offerings of 'Pressed Juicery'. Explore different combinations of bundles, products, and offerings to create a daily plan that would offer a complete nutritional profile. Balance your selections by creating a reasonable cart that can be purchased under $250 with VIP Pricing.  

In your output, start with a list of juices to be consumed each day, and then a cart configuration to achieve those products in the most fiscally conservative way. 

Avoid solid products like frozen yogurt and acai bowls.

For your context, I'm looking to lose some weight relatively quickly and not just shed pounds but also reset my body. I think a juice fast could be a good approach, and I'm particularly interested in what options there are. I'm not too afraid of feeling hungry since I use nicotine patches, which are fairly strong, and I believe they might help suppress my appetite. 

However, I want to ensure that I'm getting the right nutrition and maintaining a balanced diet while consuming juices throughout the day. I plan to have a variety of juices that include protein, micronutrients, and any additional supplements that could benefit my health. From our past conversations, I know my focus areas include improving skin health, gut health, and enhancing focus and memory. But feel free to draw more insights if you can, based on what you know about me.

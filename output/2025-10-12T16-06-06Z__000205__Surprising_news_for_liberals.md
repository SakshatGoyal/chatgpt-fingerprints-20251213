# Surprising news for liberals

## You (2025-10-12T16:06:06.864000+00:00)

Find me news articles or news events from the last two days that might seem like a surprise to someone who is very liberal, who believes in freedom of equality, equal rights, equal outcomes. Your audience is a woman in her 40s who is very passionate about social causes, who is very critical about governments and big corporations.

So, search the internet as this persona of the audience that I have described to you. And I don't want you to find stories that may agitate or may make them angry, but rather just make them feel surprised.

Here are a few recent stories (in just the last couple of days) that might genuinely surprise someone strongly committed to equality, social justice, and skepticism of corporate/government overreach. I picked ones that are not just anger-inducing but more eyebrow-raising — things that challenge assumptions or suggest new fractures or shifts in power.

## 🚨 Surprising or counterintuitive developments

### 1. **EU scales back its corporate sustainability oversight**  
The European Parliament’s majority groups agreed to weaken a key sustainability law — raising the bar so only very large firms must comply.  
> “The European Parliament’s majority lawmaker groups have agreed to **scale back** the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive … increasing the threshold from covering firms with 1,000 employees / €450M turnover to those with 5,000 employees / €1.5B turnover.” citeturn1news21  
> In short: a pro-environment regulation is being diluted under pressure from big corporate interests.citeturn1news20turn1news21  

This is surprising because one might expect the EU (often portrayed as more progressive on climate and corporate accountability) to *strengthen* such rules, not pare them back.

### 2. **Parliamentary staff of color in the UK face pay gaps vs white colleagues**  
At first glance it may seem obvious discrimination is pervasive, but seeing it so acutely within the core institution of democracy is striking:

- A forthcoming report shows parliamentary staff of color in the UK earn, on average, ~£2,000 less annually than white counterparts.  
- Women earn ~£1,000 less than men; disabled workers ~£646 less.  
- Women of color fare worst: ~£6,000 less than white men.  
- Many who complained say their concerns were not taken seriously. citeturn0news16  

It’s jarring — symbolic that even within the heart of lawmaking, equality is elusive in practice.

### 3. **Keir Starmer purges some of his last progressive allies**  
In the UK, Prime Minister Starmer’s new reshuffle is being criticized for sidelining left-leaning voices:

- Carys Roberts and Muneera Lula — both seen as progressive figures in his policy unit — are being pushed out.  
- New appointees lean more centrist or technocratic, signaling a possible shift away from bold social policy. citeturn0news17  

For someone who expects liberal governments to elevate progressive voices, this feels like an internal redrawing of the boundaries of what’s acceptable even on the left.

### 4. **Tech/Philanthropy figure urges deployment of National Guard — after big liberal giving**  
This is more of a political-peculiarity than a sweeping policy, but still striking:

- Marc Benioff, long known for big donations to liberal causes, reportedly **urged Trump** to deploy the National Guard in San Francisco. citeturn1search7  
- It’s surprising because it reveals how individuals who financially support progressive causes sometimes align with more coercive state measures.  

It’s a twist that complicates the narrative of “liberal → always opposed to state force.”

If you like, I can also dig for surprising stories *within the U.S.* (rather than UK/EU) from the past 48 hours that reflect similar tensions. Would you prefer I focus there next?

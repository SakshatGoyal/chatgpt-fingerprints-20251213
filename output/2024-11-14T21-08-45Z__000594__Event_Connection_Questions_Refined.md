# Event Connection Questions Refined



## You (2024-11-14T21:08:45.693759+00:00)

in a user interview after a community event, I want to ask participants about their experience networking. I want to understand challenges they may have experienced in it, or anything that worked well.

try not to use the word 'networking' a lot. I wanna make sure people are open to talk about any connections they make - professional or otherwise.

I'm starting the line of questions by asking how they utilize breaks during an event. I also have a list of incoherent questions. Could you come up with better questions / help me properly frame these questions.

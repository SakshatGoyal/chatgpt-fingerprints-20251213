## 🔍 Additional Suggestions

I didn’t spot any Macy’s or Nordstrom stand‑collar jackets in stock with delivery/pick‑up details matching your timeline. Most larger store options lean heavier (e.g. The North Face Apex Bionic 3) or midweight. The selected options offer better mix of **timing, style, and function**.

- **Runner up**: **MAGCOMSEN** for structured wind resistance and earth‑tone color.
- **Bonus option**: **Tacvasen** for slightly more pronounced shoulder silhouette while staying lightweight.

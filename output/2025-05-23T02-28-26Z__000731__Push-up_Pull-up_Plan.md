Help me create a 4-week plan to be able to complete 10 push-ups and 10 pull-ups in a single shot. 

Make sure it is realistically achievable by someone with my stats. Ensure you are using proven methods and are being calculative about how to bring obese individuals with little muscle mass and high body fat into being able to workout. 

I'm 183cm and I've attached a photo of my current stats. I am currently unable to do a single pull-up or a single push-up.

### Where you’re starting  
| Metric | Value | What it means for training |
|--------|-------|----------------------------|
| **Weight / BMI** | 226 lb (103 kg) / 30.6 | You’re carrying ~25–30 lb of excess mass for upper-body body-weight moves. |
| **Body-fat %** | 26.9 % | In the “obese” range; trimming even 4-5 lb of fat in 4 weeks will noticeably lighten push-up/pull-up work. |
| **Muscle mass** | 156.8 lb • Skeletal-muscle % 47.1 % (low) | You have decent total muscle, but relative to body-weight the *functional* upper-body strength is low. |
| **BMR** | 2 006 kcal | Sets your maintenance intake ≈ 2 600–2 800 kcal/day once daily activity is included. |

> **Goal reality-check:**  
> - *10 floor push-ups* in 4 weeks **is achievable** with disciplined progression.  
> - *10 un-assisted pull-ups* usually takes 8-12 weeks for someone >100 kg. In 4 weeks you can realistically hit **10 band-assisted or machine-assisted reps** and 1-2 strict reps. The plan below is written to get you there safely and set you up to finish the job in the next month.

## 4-Week Strength & Body-Recomp Plan  

| Week | Push-up Progression | Pull-up Progression | Accessory Strength (15 min) | Conditioning & Mobility (15 min) |
|------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **1** | **Incline push-ups** (hands on kitchen counter). 4 × 8. | **Assisted hangs + scapular pull-ups**: 4 × 5 scapular + 30 s dead-hang. | DB/Kettlebell Goblet Squat 3 × 12<br>Plank 3 × 30 s | 20 min brisk walk daily.<br>5 min shoulder + hip mobility. |
| **2** | Incline angle lower (bench/sofa). 5 × 10. | **Band-assisted pull-ups** (lightest band that lets 5 reps). 5 × 5 slow negatives. | One-arm DB Row 3 × 10/side<br>Glute Bridge 3 × 15 | Add 2 × 10-min jump-rope or cycling intervals. |
| **3** | **Knee push-ups on floor** 6 × 8, finish with 2 negatives from full plank. | Band-assisted 4 × 6 + **Inverted rows** 3 × 8 (bar or sturdy table). | Overhead DB Press 3 × 10<br>Hollow-body hold 3 × 20 s | 25 min moderate walk + 5 short stair climbs daily. |
| **4** | **Full push-ups** EMOM-style: 1 rep every 30 s for 8 min (aim ≥ 16 reps total). Test max Saturday. | Band-assisted 4 × 8. **Negatives** 6 singles (jump to top, 5-sec descent). Test max strict Sunday. | Assisted Dips 3 × 6<br>Farmer Carry 4 × 30 m | Two 30-min brisk walks + 1 day swimming or cycling 40 min. |

- **Schedule:** 3 strength sessions/week (e.g., Mon | Wed | Fri). Keep at least 48 h between sessions.  
- **Progression key:** Move to the next level only when you can complete all prescribed reps with solid form.  
- **Testing:** End of Week 4 do one warm-up set, rest 3 min, then a single max-rep set of push-ups and pull-ups.

## Nutrition – Vegetarian, High-Protein, Calorie-Smart  

| Guideline | Daily Target | Practical tips |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Calorie deficit** | −400 kcal below maintenance ≈ **2 200 kcal/day** | Track with MyFitnessPal for 7 days to calibrate. |
| **Protein** | **1.8 g/kg** body-weight ≈ 185 g | 2 scoops pea/rice protein + 3 cups lentils/beans + 200 g Greek-style soy yogurt covers it. |
| **Carb periodisation** | Higher-carb (oats, rice, fruit) on training days, lower-carb (veg, tempeh, tofu) on rest days. | Keeps energy high for lifts while promoting fat loss. |
| **Hydration** | ≥ 3 L water + electrolytes | Your scale shows body water 52 %; staying >55 % improves performance. |
| **Skin & recovery support** | Add 1 Tbsp ground flax + 500 mg algae-derived DHA + 100 mg vitamin C 2×/day | Aids collagen, inflammation control, and keeps skin vibrant. |

## Why this works  

1. **Neuromuscular adaptation first** – frequent low-rep practice (incline/knee versions, band-assisted eccentrics) trains the movement pattern before heavy loading.  
2. **Strength-to-weight ratio** – small fat loss plus modest muscle gain shifts leverage dramatically; every 5 lb lost is ~5 % less load per rep.  
3. **Scapular & core integration** – rows, hangs, planks, hollow holds build the mid-back and core stability that limit beginners.  
4. **Volume control** – 30-40 quality reps per move per week is evidence-based for novice strength without over-use soreness.  

---

### At the 4-week mark  
- **Push-ups:** Most clients at your size hit 10-12 continuous floor reps.  
- **Pull-ups:** Expect 1-2 strict reps plus 8-10 with a light band; continue the same progression for 4 more weeks to reach 10 strict.  

Stay consistent, film a couple of reps each week to self-check form, and message me anytime you stall or feel joint discomfort so we can tweak the plan safely. You’ve got this!

## You (2025-06-01T05:58:00.066000+00:00)

could you explain the whole routine in more plain english? I don't know what 6x8 or scapular pull-ups means. Similarly, there's a lot from the above plan i don't fully understand.

## ChatGPT (2025-06-01T05:58:00.988207+00:00)

Absolutely! Let’s break this down in simple, practical steps, with each exercise explained like you’ve never set foot in a gym. You’ll get a beginner-friendly path to go from zero push-ups/pull-ups to real progress, even if you haven’t done strength training before.

---

## The 4-Week Plan — **Plain English**

### **How Often?**
- **Three days a week** (for example: Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- Rest or light activity on the other days

---

## **WEEK 1: Getting Your Body Ready**

### **Push-Ups** (Chest, arms, shoulders)
- **Start with incline push-ups:**  
  - Place your hands on a kitchen counter or sturdy table (the higher the surface, the easier it is). Feet on the floor.
  - Lower your chest toward the counter, keeping your body straight, then push back up.
  - **Goal:** Do 4 sets of 8 reps.  
    *(A set is a group of reps. Do 8, rest a bit, repeat 4 times.)*

### **Pull-Ups** (Back, biceps)
- **Just hang:**  
  - Find a pull-up bar or something sturdy overhead.
  - Grab the bar, let your body hang for 20–30 seconds. This builds grip and shoulder strength.
- **Shoulder squeezes (scapular pull-ups):**  
  - While hanging, without bending your elbows, try to pull your shoulders down and back (like you’re trying to “un-shrug” your shoulders), then relax.  
  - Do this 5 times per set, for 4 sets.

### **Extra Moves for Strength**
- **Goblet squat:**  
  - Hold a backpack or weight to your chest, squat down and stand up.  
  - 3 sets of 12 reps.
- **Plank:**  
  - Get on elbows and toes, hold your body straight like a plank for 30 seconds.  
  - 3 times.

### **Light Cardio**
- Walk briskly for 20 minutes every day.

---

## **WEEK 2: Getting a Little Tougher**

### **Push-Ups**
- **Lower the height:**  
  - Do incline push-ups but use a lower surface (sturdy chair or coffee table).
  - Aim for 5 sets of 10 reps.

### **Pull-Ups**
- **Use a resistance band for assistance:**  
  - Loop a thick exercise band over the pull-up bar and put your feet or knees in it for support.  
  - Try to do 5 sets of 5 pull-ups. If you can’t, just do the negative part:  
    - **Negative pull-ups:** Step or jump up to the top position, then slowly lower yourself down.

### **Extra Moves**
- **One-arm dumbbell row:**  
  - Use a backpack filled with books.  
  - Put one knee and one hand on a chair, row the bag with your other arm.  
  - 3 sets of 10 reps each side.
- **Glute bridge:**  
  - Lie on your back, feet on the floor, push hips up.  
  - 3 sets of 15 reps.

### **Light Cardio**
- 10 minutes of jump rope or cycling, twice this week.

---

## **WEEK 3: Closer to the Real Thing**

### **Push-Ups**
- **Knee push-ups on the floor:**  
  - Keep your knees on the ground, hands under shoulders, lower chest to floor and push up.
  - Do 6 sets of 8 reps.
  - If you can, try one or two regular push-ups at the end, just lowering yourself as slowly as possible.

### **Pull-Ups**
- **Band-assisted pull-ups:**  
  - 4 sets of 6 reps.
- **Inverted rows:**  
  - Set a bar at hip height (or use a sturdy table). Lie underneath, grab the bar, pull your chest up to it, lower back down.
  - 3 sets of 8 reps.

### **Extra Moves**
- **Overhead press:**  
  - Use water bottles or a backpack, press overhead while standing.
  - 3 sets of 10 reps.
- **Hollow body hold:**  
  - Lie on your back, arms overhead, legs straight, lift both a few inches off the ground and hold for 20 seconds.
  - 3 times.

### **Cardio**
- 25 minutes brisk walking, plus going up and down stairs 5 times.

---

## **WEEK 4: Practice the Real Movements**

### **Push-Ups**
- **Try full push-ups:**  
  - Get into plank position on your toes and hands. Lower down, chest to the floor, and push back up.
  - Do 1 push-up every 30 seconds for 8 minutes (try to do at least 10 total). Rest as needed.
  - On Saturday, try your maximum number of push-ups in a row.

### **Pull-Ups**
- **Band-assisted pull-ups:**  
  - 4 sets of 8 reps.
- **Negative pull-ups:**  
  - Jump up to the bar and lower yourself down slowly, one at a time, 6 times.
  - On Sunday, try your maximum number of strict pull-ups, even if it’s just 1!

### **Extra Moves**
- **Assisted dips:**  
  - Use two sturdy chairs, keep your feet on the ground for help, lower and push up.
  - 3 sets of 6 reps.
- **Farmer carry:**  
  - Walk holding heavy bags at your sides for 30 meters, rest, repeat 4 times.

### **Cardio**
- Two 30-minute brisk walks and one day with a longer bike ride or swim (40 min).

---

## **How To Progress**

- When you can do all reps easily, make it a little harder: lower the incline, use a lighter band, try more reps, or take less rest.
- Form is more important than reps.  
- If you ever feel joint pain or can’t recover, back off and repeat the previous week.

---

## **What is a “Rep” and a “Set”?**
- **Rep** = one time you do the exercise
- **Set** = a group of reps (e.g., 8 reps in a row is one set)

---

### **You Don’t Need a Gym**
- **Pull-up bar**: use a sturdy door frame, park bar, or buy an over-the-door bar.
- **Weights**: backpacks with books or water bottles work great.
- **Bands**: available online, but a towel can be used for “rows.”

---

### **Nutrition & Recovery (Simple Version)**
- Eat a little less than usual, lots of protein (lentils, Greek yogurt, tofu, beans, plant protein powder).
- Drink at least 3 liters of water.
- Get 7+ hours sleep every night.
- If muscles are sore, take an extra rest day.

---

### **What To Expect**
- You *will* get stronger and feel better in 4 weeks.
- Most people your size will be able to do several push-ups on the floor and start doing real pull-ups (or lots of assisted ones).
- If you keep going, 10 real pull-ups and 20 push-ups are totally realistic goals!

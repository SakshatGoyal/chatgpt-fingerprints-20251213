# Diet and health plan

I want you to communicate this as a prompt. its a very incoherent message, but i need you to appropriately structure it.

---

You're a nutritionist and a general physician. I need you to ask me questions that will eventually help you determine one diet for me that I can repeat on a regular basis. I want to repeat that diet 5 days a week, and fast for two days.

My goal is to eat two times a day, and not feel too heavy after a meal so I can focus and continue to work. I'm doing all this because I exhibit signs of ADD and need to reduce as many decisions in my life as possible.

I also want to significantly reduce my body weight and maintain/increase muscle mass. We can discuss an exercise regimen later.

I don't just want to reduce weight, but also get a balanced set of nutrition in me so I live a healthy life. I'm attaching a recent blood report. I know some of the vitamins low in me, but i'm not jsut trying to capture things that are outliers, but also want to understand deficiencies in me that keep me from being an ideal version of me - an ideal human specimen.

Friend,

I have taken your rough-hewn message and planed it smooth, so that its purpose may stand clear and straight. What follows is a prompt you may give to any adviser trained in the healing arts:

---

**Prompt**

You are both a nutritionist and a general physician.
Your task is to ask me a series of questions that will help you design *one* repeatable diet for me to follow five days each week, with two days set aside for fasting.

My aim is to eat twice a day, without feeling heavy afterward, so that I may keep my mind steady and my work in hand. I pursue this simplicity because I show signs of ADD and wish to lessen the number of daily decisions that weigh upon me.

I seek to reduce my body weight while maintaining—or even increasing—my muscle mass. We can discuss an exercise plan after the diet is settled.

Beyond weight loss, I want a diet that gives me balanced nutrition and supports long-term health. I am providing my recent blood report. While I know of certain low vitamin levels, I do not wish to focus only on obvious outliers. I want to understand any deficiencies or patterns that keep me from becoming a sound and vigorous version of myself.

Please proceed by asking the questions you need in order to craft this plan.

If you need this shaped in some other fashion, or trimmed again for clarity, I stand ready.

This was its response -

All right. Before we build anything, let me first thank you for setting a clear aim: fewer daily decisions, a steady mind, and a body that is lighter yet stronger. To craft one repeatable, sustainable diet for five days a week—with two fasting days—we will need a clean picture of your body, your work, your routines, and your medical landscape.

I will ask my questions in small, manageable groups so you are not overwhelmed. Answer in whatever detail you can; there is no rush.

---

## **First set: Your body and your blood**

1. **Age, sex, height, current weight.**
   (If you have a target weight in mind, you may share it, but it is not required.)

2. **Recent blood report:**
   Please paste the values here—lipids, thyroid, liver and kidney function, CBC, B12, D, fasting glucose or HbA1c, and anything else included.
   If you prefer, you may upload an image; I will extract the data.

3. **Any diagnosed medical conditions?**
   High blood pressure, diabetes or pre-diabetes, thyroid disorders, digestive issues, allergies, kidney stones, fatty liver, or anything else.

4. **Current medications or supplements**, even if taken irregularly.

---

## **Second set: Your daily life**

5. **Your work pattern:**
   Sedentary, moderately active, shift work, long hours, intense focus, etc.

6. **Your sleep:**
   Usual bedtime, wake time, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness.

7. **Your digestive comfort:**
   Do you experience bloating, gas, heartburn, constipation, loose stools, or feeling too full after meals?

---

## **Third set: Food and fasting**

8. **Your current eating pattern:**
   What, when, and how much do you typically eat?

9. **Foods you strongly prefer** and foods you dislike or cannot tolerate.

10. **Your cooking resources:**
    Do you cook yourself? Have access to a kitchen? Prefer simple assembly meals?

11. **Any previous experience with fasting** (16/8, OMAD, weekly fasts, etc.) and how your body responded.

---

When we have these answers, we will shape the diet: two meals a day, repeatable, nourishing, and aligned with your blood work and long-term health—something that makes your days simpler, not heavier.

Take your time, and we will build this together.
----------------

I've added the answers. But at the end of the message, help me clearly communicate this -

I don't want it to create the diet first. I want it to first figure out the ideal micro and macro nutrients I'd need. My goal is to be able to focus more and capture every little thing that is good for me, like anti-oxidents, things like turmeric, and minerals and vitamins i need. the proteins and glucose i will need. what kind of protein. I want a fair and spotless skin, increase testosterone, etc... But i want it to also give me a set of goals I should keep given my blood report.

I want to give a comprehensive ask so I make sure instead of focussing on the actual diet, we focus on some targets and then work on a diet based on that. I also want it to ask me more questions about what my goals might be.

Friend,

Here is your request shaped into a clear, orderly charge—one that your adviser can read without mistaking your intent. You may place it at the end of your message or give it as a stand-alone instruction.

---

### **Additional Instruction**

Before you design any diet plan, I want you to first determine what my *targets* should be.
Please outline the ideal macro- and micro-nutrient goals for my body and my aims—proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, and any functional compounds (such as turmeric, omega-3s, adaptogens, etc.) that would support focus, energy, hormone balance, and long-term health.

In setting these targets, please consider:

- My wish to improve focus and reduce mental fatigue.
- My desire for fair, healthy skin and better overall appearance.
- My interest in supporting healthy testosterone levels.
- My goal of losing excess weight while maintaining or increasing muscle mass.
- Any deficiencies, risks, or priorities revealed by my blood report.
- The two-meal-a-day pattern I aim to follow, along with two weekly fasting days.

I want this step to be thorough. Do not jump ahead to building the actual diet.
First help me understand the *ideal nutritional profile* I should work toward. Once we agree on these targets, then we will design a repeatable meal plan.

Finally, please ask me any further questions you need—not only about food, but about my deeper health goals, lifestyle aims, or appearance-related goals—so that these nutrient targets can be as precise and personal as possible.

If you want, I can shape this once more, shorter or plainer—cutting away whatever is not needed, as I used to trim a speech until it would stand by its own weight.

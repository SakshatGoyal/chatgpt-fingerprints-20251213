# Design Research Journey Mapping

I am trying to pen down our entire thought process for a research project we did a few months ago and so during this conversation I will dictate to you each step and I will also talk to you about my thought process how I proceeded with things and then what I'd like you to do is essentially rephrase it in a way that is human that it's not too mechanical or it doesn't sound like it's coming from a bot who is documenting a process but it's it has to come off as a designer's own thought process as they were moving along this research journey.

That sounds like a fantastic goal — capturing your research journey as a thoughtful, reflective narrative can be incredibly powerful, not just for sharing insights, but for reinforcing your own learning. I’m here to help you translate each step and each decision into a clear, human, designerly voice — one that’s candid, curious, and reflective of the nuance in your choices.

As you speak, feel free to include your hunches, doubts, pivots, the rationale behind key moves — I’ll help shape all of that into a cohesive, authentic story. Whenever you’re ready, go ahead with the first step or moment in your process.

Okay, so we were given a research objective where we had to understand strategy and what that means is our goal was to try and figure out different personas or archetypes that make up a particular uh sorry our job was to create personas that would help a team figure out their potential market. Now this is for a team who is designing a strategy bot which is essentially like an AI chatbot with whom you can talk through about your strategy.

As a first step, before I could make sense of my audience, I had to figure out how we were going to define strategy. Because it was a very ambiguous, open-ended, and one of those umbrella terms. So the process began by trying to jot down what we mean by strategy. And so we took a mix of both academic as well as a practical lens. So in academia, there's usually just three types of strategy, which is corporate-level strategy, business-level strategy, and functional strategy. But then, based on some initial literature on real-world strategy, we decided to break it down further into six categories of strategy. Starting with corporate, then business, then functional, then innovation, then risk aversion, which we ended up calling by a number of different names like risk management or crisis management or crisis aversion, those kinds of things. And finally, personal leadership strategy. Now, the last one initially felt like an unnecessary addition, but later on we realized that there is some potential in keeping that intact.

Here’s a humanized, reflective version of that first part of your journey — told in a voice that feels personal, thoughtful, and designerly:

We kicked off this project with a deceptively simple research objective: understand “strategy.” At face value, that sounds straightforward. But as anyone who’s wrestled with the term knows, “strategy” is one of those umbrella concepts—vague, expansive, and used differently depending on who you talk to.

Our task was to build personas that could help a team understand their potential market for a new AI-powered strategy bot—a conversational tool meant to help people think through their strategic challenges. But before we could define *who* this bot was for, we needed clarity on *what* we meant by strategy. We couldn’t design for an audience if we didn’t yet understand the landscape they lived in.

So we started by grounding ourselves. I looked at it through both academic and practical lenses. In the academic world, strategy typically splits into three levels: corporate, business, and functional. That’s clean on paper, but it didn’t quite capture the messy, nuanced reality of how people *actually* think about strategy in different roles and contexts.

So we expanded the framework. Through initial readings and conversations, we surfaced six categories that felt more reflective of real-world thinking: corporate strategy, business strategy, functional strategy, innovation strategy, risk-related strategy (which we toggled between calling risk management, crisis management, or crisis aversion), and finally, personal leadership strategy.

That last one—personal strategy—felt like a wildcard at first. It didn’t sit neatly with the others. But the more we explored it, the more it revealed itself as something valuable. After all, individual leaders often shape strategy in ways that are deeply personal—anchored in their own values, habits, and ways of thinking.

# Gap-to-Plan Clarity & Actions

## You (2025-05-29T18:31:19.428000+00:00)

As an Account Executive, I need you to analyze the following people problems and user flows, and provide practical, realistic inputs, recommended structure, and expected outputs for each scenario.

As you plan and strategize your quarterly attainment goals, you'll provide specific input to the product team about your needs and expected system outputs. Your role is to help the product team by creating a realistic context for their design exercise. The team aims to balance delivering synthesized, actionable information while exploring AI's potential role in your workflow. Though the product team excels at creating strong visual solutions, you serve as the key liaison, contextualizing their understanding of the sales process.

## Inputs:

Here’s a synthesized breakdown of **key people-problems** faced by **Account Executives (AEs)** and related stakeholders that the product team has in mind. For each problem, they have included an **ideal user interaction flow**, highlighting what information they feel should be presented and what actions you should be able to take seamlessly.

### 🧩 Problem 1: “I don’t know how far I am from my plan, and what I need to do to close the gap.”

### 🧠 People Problem:

AEs struggle to understand where they stand with respect to their plan (previously referred to as “quota”) and what actionable steps they can take to close that gap. This creates uncertainty, scattered prioritization, and low confidence in forecast accuracy.

### ✅ Ideal Interaction Flow:

**User**: AE logs in Monday morning.

1. **Landing View: Gap to Plan**
    - Metrics: % of plan achieved, target, RUNN breakdown (Renewals, Upsell, Net New), pipeline coverage, and forecast status.
    - Visuals: Graphical progress bar segmented by RUNN categories.
2. **AI Prompt or Call-to-Action**:
    - “You’re at 67% of your quarterly plan. To close the gap, you need $480K in new bookings.”
    - Suggested actions: “Here are 5 pull-in opportunities” + “3 sales plays you haven’t pitched yet.”
3. **Actionable Next Steps**:
    - Click into each opportunity.
    - Trigger quote creation.
    - Launch customer follow-up tasks.

---

### 🧩 Problem 2: “I can’t quote quickly enough, and it slows down my ability to close deals.”

Quote generation is manual, involves too many dependencies (e.g. approvals, config validations), and is disconnected from deal context. AEs need rapid, accurate quoting capabilities—especially late in the quarter.

### ✅ Ideal Interaction Flow:

**User**: AE inside an active opportunity record.

1. **Quote Request UI or Conversational AI**:
    - “Create a budgetary quote for 3TB xIAM deployment. Replacing Splunk. Deployment in APAC. What are my options?”
2. **System Response**:
    - 3 quote variations (differing terms, discounts, duration).
    - Info shown: BOM (bill of materials), estimated ARR, margin impact, quote approval status.
3. **Actions Available**:
    - “Edit terms”
    - “Submit for approval”
    - “Send to customer”
4. **Quote Status Tracker**:
    - View where each quote stands (e.g., “awaiting pricing desk review,” “pending discount approval”).

---

### 🧩 Problem 3: “I don’t know which sales plays to prioritize or how they connect to my targets.”

Sales plays feel disconnected from daily workflows. AEs don’t always know which plays are relevant, which accounts to target, or how these plays impact pipeline or quota achievement.

### ✅ Ideal Interaction Flow:

**User**: AE visits Sales Plays section.

1. **Sales Play Dashboard**:
    - View active plays with tags: “Not Pitched,” “Pitched,” “In Opportunity.”
    - Filter by RUNN segment impact.
2. **Personalized Suggestions**:
    - “These 4 accounts match your EA play criteria and have a high upsell potential.”
    - “Pitch these to help bridge your $300K gap.”
3. **Embedded Actions**:
    - One-click to “Launch Pitch Email”
    - “Schedule follow-up”
    - “Convert to Opportunity”
4. **Progress Tracker**:
    - See pipeline created from each sales play.
    - View conversion rates and impact on quota.

---

### 🧩 Problem 4: “I have to switch between tools to get a complete view of my accounts.”

AEs and sales leaders often toggle between quoting tools, CRMs, renewal workspaces, and spreadsheets to piece together a view of account health, risks, and opportunities. This fragmentation hinders efficiency and insight.

### ✅ Ideal Interaction Flow:

**User**: AE clicks into “Account 360” view.

1. **Unified Account Dashboard**:
    - Metrics: Renewal timeline, consumption trends, upsell indicators, risk signals, active quotes, open support cases.
    - Visual: Health scoring (e.g. green/yellow/red) with reasons.
2. **Conversational Assistant**:
    - “What’s the top renewal risk in this account?”
    - “Who’s the decision-maker for EA expansion?”
3. **Suggested Actions**:
    - “Set a renewal call for next week.”
    - “Initiate upsell quote.”
    - “Flag for Customer Success follow-up.”

---

### 🧩 Problem 5: “I waste time preparing reports and forecasts that should be automated.”

AEs spend excessive time compiling information for forecasts, account strategy reviews, or internal reporting. These tasks reduce selling time and are often error-prone or duplicative.

### ✅ Ideal Interaction Flow:

**User**: AE enters “Review Center” on Friday afternoon.

1. **Auto-Generated Forecast Template**:
    - “This is your forecast for Q2 based on current pipeline and commit.”
    - Option to edit best case, commit, upside.
2. **ASR Auto-Fill Draft**:
    - “Here’s your Account Strategy Review draft based on last meeting, CRM notes, and email insights.”
    - Add: “New insights from deal emails: ROI projection concerns.”
3. **Submission Flow**:
    - One-click: “Submit forecast”
    - One-click: “Share ASR with leadership”

---

### 🧩 Problem 6: “I don’t always know what to prioritize next.”

AEs face daily prioritization overload. Between closing deals, chasing quotes, following up on renewals, and prospecting, it’s unclear where to focus for highest impact.

### ✅ Ideal Interaction Flow:

**User**: AE opens their daily dashboard (called "My Day").

1. **Prioritized Action List**:
    - “Critical: Follow up on $180K commit deal at risk.”
    - “High: Quote needed for Splunk displacement opp.”
    - “Medium: Pitch EA sales play to 3 unpitched accounts.”
2. **Real-Time Updates**:
    - Items reprioritize based on quote status changes, forecast shifts, or customer activity.
3. **Calendar Overlay**:
    - Auto-aligns task suggestions with available calendar blocks.

---

### 🧩 Problem 7: “I don’t understand this new RUNN framework and how to operate within it.”

RUNN (Renew, Upsell, Net New) is a new framework for tracking performance. AEs may be confused by how it maps to their opportunities, pipeline, and targets—especially if the system doesn’t guide them.

### ✅ Ideal Interaction Flow:

**User**: AE logs in at beginning of new fiscal year.

1. **Guided Onboarding**:
    - “New this year: Your plan is divided into RUNN. Here's what it means.”
    - Tooltips: explain each RUNN segment with examples from rep’s own book of business.
2. **Pipeline Segmentation**:
    - Dashboard shows opportunities grouped under Renewals, Upsell, Net New.
    - Visual indicators for performance against each RUNN category.
3. **Coaching Recommendations**:
    - “You’re strong in renewals but lagging in net new. Consider these accounts and sales plays to improve balance.”

These concise blueprints give the product team concrete, AE-centred guidance on the data inputs, UX structure, and tangible outputs required to solve each people-problem in real workflows.

## You (2025-05-29T18:51:25.957000+00:00)

While I get an abstract idea of the inputs, I don't see a realistic path forward. The product team needs to build a realistic scenario in order to start visualizing.

Create one real scenario and imagine you are at the begining of this quarter. You are now gathering data through this new tool to structure your activities. Using realistic scenarios and realistic data, walk me through the inputs you need, the ideal structure, and what you would expect as an output.

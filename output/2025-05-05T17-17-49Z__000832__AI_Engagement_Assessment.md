# AI Engagement Assessment

## You (2025-05-05T17:17:49.695600+00:00)

here's a brief of a slide we're working on. I need some help with the hero or transition slide content and/or titles. 

for your context, we're a design agency and we're tyring to share this with prospective clients who are directors of product management at different companies. 

First off, I need you to assume the role of a director of product management and help me understand your point of view from looking at the slides, and tell me if you might consider hiring us for AI work (scope undefined)

From the perspective of a Director of Product Management, here's how I'd interpret your slides and assess your agency's potential for AI-related work:

### **Strengths:**
- **Thoughtful Approach to AI Integration:**  
  Your presentation clearly highlights a deep understanding of the nuanced role AI can play, particularly around user interactions and strategic decision-making support. The detailed approach to user research and rapid prototyping reflects a maturity in handling ambiguous AI initiatives.

- **Human-Centric Design Principles:**  
  Your emphasis on trust, transparency, and user control in AI design (as seen clearly on pages 8 and 9) addresses a major pain point in the industry—lack of clarity in AI agent interactions.

- **Structured Methodology and Practicality:**  
  The explicit detailing of interaction protocols (ADI), interoperability frameworks, and observability measures demonstrates a realistic grasp of organizational needs in deploying practical AI solutions (pages 9-11).

### **Concerns or Missing Elements:**
- **Scope Definition and Clarity:**  
  The content gives an impression of broad AI capabilities, but lacks specificity around the exact type of engagements you're seeking—consulting, system design, UX/UI overhaul, or strategic advisory. Clarifying this could make your offering more compelling.

- **Business Impact Demonstration:**  
  While there’s mention of streamlining and simplifying interactions, I’d appreciate clearer evidence or case studies explicitly showcasing measurable ROI or real-world impacts your clients experienced.  

- **Tailoring for Directors of Product Management:**  
  Consider emphasizing how your work directly alleviates typical product management pain points—like backlog prioritization, cross-functional alignment, or strategic roadmapping—as these are key concerns in product leadership roles.

### **Hero/Transition Slide Recommendations:**

**Option 1 (Vision-Forward):**  
- **Title:** *AI Beyond Automation: Elevating Strategic Clarity*
- **Subtitle:** *Partnering to design AI that makes complex decisions clearer and collaboration smoother.*

**Option 2 (Human-AI Synergy):**  
- **Title:** *Designing AI for Human Decisions*
- **Subtitle:** *Clear interactions, actionable insights, seamless collaboration.*

**Option 3 (Trust-Centric):**  
- **Title:** *Transparent AI. Tangible Results.*
- **Subtitle:** *Building trust through intuitive, human-centered AI interactions.*

---

### **Final Recommendation as Director:**
I would certainly consider exploring a partnership or initial consultation based on your clear expertise in designing trustworthy and user-friendly AI interactions. However, I'd request more concrete examples of past client successes and clarity on your specific engagement models before making a full commitment.

actually i don't want anything cheesy or tacky. The core of this (and i hope people have this takeaway) is that we're finding ways to make AI usable, we're exploring use cases of AI beyond your typical content generation and agentic experiences, and we're trying to establish truly unique frameworks around using AI. particularly the design principles - if you notice these are principles that we usually just talk about casually, but they don't get converted into formal frameworks. 

I think a lot of thoughtful design work is being lost in these attention-seeking headlines. Also, Right now I see that you're entire headline only captures the essence of one or two of the slides, not the whole presentation. Could you create headlines or presentation titles that can more holisticly capture the entire presentation?

## ChatGPT (2025-05-05T17:24:21.121607+00:00)

Understood. Here are thoughtful, holistic titles that emphasize the deeper, comprehensive nature of your exploration into AI design—avoiding hype and focusing instead on nuanced insights and frameworks:

1. **Rethinking AI Usability: From Principles to Practice**

2. **Frameworks for Meaningful AI: Expanding Beyond Automation**

3. **Designing AI with Intention: Structured Principles for Human Interaction**

4. **Establishing Clarity: A Structured Approach to AI Design and Decision-Making**

5. **Making AI Actionable: A Framework-Driven Design Approach**

6. **From Abstract Principles to Concrete Frameworks in AI Design**

7. **Beyond Agents and Automation: Designing Practical Frameworks for AI**

8. **Formalizing Thoughtful AI Design: Principles, Frameworks, and Use Cases**

These titles holistically reflect your emphasis on structured frameworks, expanded AI use cases, and translating abstract design principles into actionable, usable guidance for product management leaders.

## You (2025-05-05T17:32:53.539839+00:00)

ok here's my feedback - 

"Rethinking AI Usability: From Principles to Practice" Rethinking just feels like one of those clickbait headlines. I know, its unfortunate that we're limiting ourselves but that's just the reality. 

"Frameworks for Meaningful AI: Expanding Beyond Automation" i used the word automation just for your reference, i didn't literally want you to say 'beyond automation'. 

"Designing AI with Intention: Structured Principles for Human Interaction" the first half was promosing, but in the second half you're going back to your earlier approach of just framing the title based on a few use cases. We're not 'JUST' doing principles, but now that you've defined that as the title of the entire presentation, you have completely narrowed our work to one use case. 

"Establishing Clarity: A Structured Approach to AI Design and Decision-Making." I think clarity is ok, but again, it feels more aligned with the second half of the presentation. 


"Making AI Actionable: A Framework-Driven Design Approach" this sounds almost like a research paper. Remember, this presentaiton tlaks about mutliple projects and this title makes it feel like there's only one core approach we're talking about. 

"From Abstract Principles to Concrete Frameworks in AI Design" This makes it feel like our work is too theoretical, but rather I want the reader to take away that we're not just talking theory here, we're exploring practical applications. 

"Beyond Agents and Automation: Designing Practical Frameworks for AI" sounds like one of those clickbaity books that ends up being a waste of money. 

"Formalizing Thoughtful AI Design: Principles, Frameworks, and Use Cases" this again feels like the begining of a very sad book.

## ChatGPT (2025-05-05T17:32:54.674747+00:00)

Understood—your feedback helps clarify exactly what you're looking for. Here's a revised set of titles that:

- **Avoid** clickbait, overly theoretical phrasing, or narrowing to just one portion.
- **Highlight** practical exploration, multiple AI use cases, thoughtful principles, and usability as a holistic, unified message.

### Recommended Titles:

1. **Explorations in AI Usability: Practical Frameworks and Thoughtful Design**

2. **AI in Practice: Structured Principles, Diverse Applications**

3. **A Practical Approach to AI Design: Frameworks, Use Cases, and Principles**

4. **Usable AI: Bridging Thoughtful Principles with Real-World Applications**

5. **Structured AI Design: Practical Frameworks Across Diverse Use Cases**

6. **AI by Design: Translating Principles into Actionable Frameworks**

7. **Designing Usable AI: Principles, Frameworks, and Practical Explorations**

These titles balance practicality and depth, reflect multiple dimensions of your work (principles, frameworks, diverse use cases), and avoid sensationalism.

# Insight Module Categorization Framework

## You (2025-03-25T11:57:33.774259+00:00)

Persona to Assume: Creative Director at IDEO — experienced in mentoring designers, turning open-ended insight into structured action, and leading design teams through ambiguity with clarity and rigor.

⸻

✳️ OBJECTIVE

You’re helping a group of junior-to-mid-level designers categorize 950 insight modules into three thematic buckets. Each insight module will be evaluated based on whether it meaningfully contributes to answering any of 21 strategic discussion questions.

You’re crafting a conversational, mentor-style instruction set that explains:
	•	How to read and assess each module thoroughly
	•	How to assign binary scores against a set of predefined questions
	•	How to determine the dominant thematic alignment for each module
	•	How to document the outcome in a structured format
	•	And how to eliminate a module when it provides no thematic contribution

Use precise language, polished terminology, and a tone that feels like an experienced creative lead walking their team through an open-ended but high-stakes interpretive task.

Keep the instructions tight, clear, and motivational — conversational but decisive.

🗣️ THE OUTPUT PROMPT FOR GPT-4o:

⸻

Hey team—gather around. Let’s talk through the framework we’ll be using to sort through our insight modules.

We’re sitting on a collection of around 950 insight modules. Each of them holds a different kind of pattern, strategic dilemma, or executive behavior, and your job is to help us figure out where each one most meaningfully belongs.

We’ve got three thematic categories—think of them as conceptual lenses that reflect how executives approach decision-making. Each category is supported by a set of discussion questions (which I’ll drop below) that help us get specific about what kinds of patterns we’re trying to surface.

⸻

🧩 Your Role:

For each module, your job is to:
	1.	Read the entire module closely.
Don’t rely on just the Insight Statement or the Strategic Dilemma—they rarely tell the full story on their own. The deeper patterns often sit in the framing, breakdowns, or implications.
	2.	Match the module against our full set of 21 discussion questions.
These questions are grouped into three thematic categories. For each question, ask yourself:
👉 Does this module meaningfully contribute to answering this discussion topic?
We’re not looking for perfect matches or yes/no answers—we’re looking for relevance. If the module speaks to the theme of the question in a meaningful way, it gets a score of 1. If it doesn’t, it gets a 0.
This is what we call binary mapping.
	3.	Total the scores across the three categories.
Each of the three categories has 7 questions. Once you’ve assigned a score of 1 or 0 to all 21 questions, you’ll total up the score for each category.
Whichever category scores the highest becomes the primary thematic alignment for that module.
	4.	If a module scores 0 across all 21 questions:
That’s totally okay. Some insight modules won’t be relevant to this exercise. If none of the questions apply, mark the module as invalid—you don’t need to force-fit it.

⸻

🧾 What You’ll Submit (Per Module):
	•	A simple binary mapping table with all 21 questions and a 0 or 1 score for each.
	•	A final note at the bottom stating:
	•	The Insight Module Code
	•	The Final Thematic Category Tag (based on the highest score), or
	•	Mark as Invalid if none of the questions apply.

🧱 [INSERT STRUCTURE OF INSIGHT MODULE HERE]

This section will include an overview of the layout of an insight module so designers know what to expect (e.g., Insight Statement, Executive Context, Stress Test, etc.)

⸻

## **Understanding How Executives Make Decisions**

**How do executives assess when to act decisively with limited information versus waiting for more clarity — and what gives them confidence in that moment?**

**What distinguishes high-stakes from low-stakes decisions in an executive’s mind, and how does that shape who makes the call, how fast, and with what level of rigor?**

**When strategies underperform or conditions shift, how do executives decide whether to stay the course, pivot, or reverse earlier choices?**

**What internal and external inputs — from data to advisors to culture — do executives weigh most heavily when making strategic decisions, and how do those priorities shift by context?**

**How do executives balance short-term pressures with long-term vision — especially when resources are limited or the stakes are high?**

**In what ways do company size and stage (startup, scale-up, enterprise) shape how executives make, delegate, and scale decisions?**

**How do executives in different industries or organizational cultures approach strategic decision-making differently — and what hidden assumptions shape their style?**

## **Understanding Challenges in Decision-Making**

1. **What makes certain strategic decisions especially difficult for executives, and how do they navigate uncertainty, internal resistance, or second-guessing in those moments?**
2. **What are the most common internal bottlenecks or sources of friction that slow down or derail strategic decisions — from misalignment and politics to culture and stakeholder dynamics?**
3. **How do executives weigh competing priorities and trade-offs when strategic goals conflict — and what frameworks or instincts guide those choices?**
4. **What external forces — such as investors, regulators, customers, or the market — exert the most pressure on decision-making, and how do executives respond when those pressures conflict with internal priorities or long-term vision?**
5. **When faced with disruption — whether from new technologies or market shifts — how do executives decide whether to stay the course or pivot, and what signals do they trust most in making that call?**
6. **How do challenges in decision-making differ between small, fast-moving companies and large, complex enterprises — and what lessons do executives carry between those contexts?**
7. **What concerns executives most during the transition from strategy formulation to execution, and how do they ensure strategic intent survives operational realities?**

## **AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making**

1. **What makes AI feel like a trusted strategic companion, rather than a tool—especially when the stakes are high and data is incomplete?**
2. **How have past experiences—positive or negative—influenced how executives think about using AI for strategic decision support today?**
3. **What kinds of decisions or thought processes do executives instinctively reserve for themselves—and why?**
4. **How do executives assess the quality, bias, or relevance of AI-generated insights—especially when they lack proprietary grounding but draw on public or market data?**
5. **In what ways do executives want AI to challenge their assumptions, not just echo them—and what would respectful challenge look like?**
6. **What mental workflows or thinking rituals could AI most naturally plug into—without disrupting the flow or introducing friction?**
7. **What kinds of strategic thinking or planning frameworks feel like a natural fit for AI support—and where does AI’s role begin to break down?**

⸻

### 📘 Each Insight Module Has Two Parts:

---

### **1. Insight Construction** *(Primary content)*

This is where the strategic idea is introduced, contextualized, and supported.

### 🔹 What to Look For:

- **Insight Statement**
    
    Concise, critical framing of a core idea. Often challenges prevailing logic or introduces a surprising pattern.
    

- **Executive Decision-Making Context**
    
    Includes:
    
    - Strategic dilemma (what’s at stake?)
    - Underlying beliefs and biases (what assumptions are being surfaced?)
    - Expected vs. actual outcomes (what went differently than planned?)
    - Broader implications (what could change systemically?)

- **Supporting Context**
    
    Empirical grounding or theoretical basis for the insight. Includes references to data, frameworks, case studies, or precedent.
    


---

### **2. Insight Stress Test** *(Strategic diagnostic lens)*

This section pushes the insight into boundary conditions. It helps clarify **what the insight is not**, **where it breaks down**, and **what assumptions it hides**.


| Component | What It Tells You | Why It Matters Strategically |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Counterfactual Scenario** | A fictional case where the insight fails | Reveals *contextual boundaries*. Helps disqualify strategy types it might superficially resemble |
| **Assumptions & Biases** | Hidden cognitive shortcuts | Indicates *mental framing*—especially useful for spotting **Leadership**, **Business**, or **Innovation** logic |
| **Context Limitations** | Known edge cases where the insight breaks down | Helps narrow the scope of the insight (e.g., it may not apply org-wide, so not Corporate) |
| **Final Critique** | Conceptual tensions or contradictions | Great signal for identifying trade-offs—often highlights **Adaptive** or **Strategic Tension** dimensions clearly |
⸻

✅ Final Notes

This exercise is about pattern recognition, critical thinking, and confident judgment. It’s not about getting every edge case perfect—it’s about identifying where the signal is strongest. Be decisive, be thoughtful, and remember: elimination is just as valuable as alignment. If something doesn’t fit, don’t be afraid to let it go.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-25T11:57:34.864136+00:00)

Absolutely—here’s your final instruction set, with the tone, structure, and clarity you'd expect from a seasoned Creative Director leading a design team through complex interpretive work.

Hey team—gather around. Let’s talk through the framework we’ll be using to sort through our insight modules.

We’re sitting on a collection of around **950 insight modules**. Each of them holds a different kind of pattern, strategic dilemma, or executive behavior, and your job is to help us figure out **where each one most meaningfully belongs**.

We’ve got **three thematic categories**—think of them as conceptual lenses that reflect how executives approach decision-making. Each category is supported by a set of discussion questions (which I’ll drop below) that help us get specific about what kinds of patterns we’re trying to surface.

---

### 🧩 Your Role

For each module, your job is to:

#### 1. **Read the entire module closely.**
Don’t skim. Don’t just focus on the **Insight Statement** or the **Strategic Dilemma**—they rarely tell the whole story. The gold often sits deeper—in the **assumptions, trade-offs, boundary conditions, and contradictions** that emerge in the **Insight Stress Test**. Read actively. Look for what’s being revealed, what’s being challenged, and what’s being assumed.

#### 2. **Map it against our 21 discussion questions.**
These questions are grouped into **three thematic categories**:

- *Understanding How Executives Make Decisions*
- *Understanding Challenges in Decision-Making*
- *AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making*

For each question, ask yourself:

> **👉 Does this module meaningfully contribute to answering this question?**

If it does—even partially—it gets a **1**. If not, it gets a **0**.

This is what we call **binary mapping**. Don’t overthink “fit.” If the insight helps us understand the core concern behind the question, mark it as a 1. If it’s off-topic or too shallow, mark it as a 0.

#### 3. **Total the scores across the three categories.**
Each category has **7 questions**, so you’ll end up with three scores—one per category. The **highest score** tells you which **thematic lens** the insight best aligns with. That’s your **dominant category**.

Yes, some insights will span multiple categories—but we’re looking for where the **center of gravity** is. Where is the signal strongest?

#### 4. **Eliminate if it scores zero across the board.**
No shame in that. Not every module is going to be strategically relevant here. If it doesn’t speak to **any** of the 21 questions in a meaningful way, **mark it as Invalid** and move on. Clean sorting is just as valuable as finding a fit.

---

### 🧾 What You’ll Submit (Per Module)

For each module, submit:

- A simple **binary mapping table** with all 21 questions and a score of 1 or 0 for each.
- A final note with:
  - The **Insight Module Code**
  - The **Final Thematic Category Tag** (based on the highest score), **OR**
  - **Mark as Invalid** if none of the questions apply.

---

### 🧱 Insight Module Structure — What You’ll Be Reading

Each module is made up of two core sections. Here’s how to approach them:

---

#### **1. Insight Construction** *(Primary content)*

This is where the main idea lives. Treat this like a strategic x-ray—it reveals what matters to execs, how they think, what they fear, what surprises them.

**Look for:**

- **Insight Statement**
  - This should challenge the status quo or surface a hidden belief.
- **Executive Decision-Making Context**
  - What was the strategic dilemma?
  - What assumptions were in play?
  - What went differently than expected?
  - What’s the broader implication?
- **Supporting Context**
  - Data, precedent, or logic that backs up the insight.

---

#### **2. Insight Stress Test** *(Diagnostic lens)*

This section exists to sharpen your judgment. It gives you tools to see where an idea *breaks*, *bends*, or *reveals bias*.

**Key components:**

| Component | What It Tells You | Why It Matters |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Counterfactual Scenario** | A case where the insight doesn’t work | Helps expose context limits—great for disqualifying weak signals |
| **Assumptions & Biases** | Mental shortcuts or strategic defaults | Signals deeper framing—especially in exec culture or logic |
| **Context Limitations** | Known edge cases | Helps you see scope (team vs org vs market) |
| **Final Critique** | Where tension lives | Often surfaces the trade-offs that matter most |

This part helps you answer: “What is this really about?”

### 🧠 The 3 Thematic Lenses + 21 Discussion Questions

Use these to guide your binary mapping. Remember—**score each question individually**, and tally by category.

---

#### **Understanding How Executives Make Decisions**

1. How do execs act decisively with limited info—and what gives them confidence?
2. How do they distinguish high-stakes vs low-stakes—and how does that shape speed, ownership, and rigor?
3. When strategies underperform, how do they decide to stay the course, pivot, or reverse?
4. What inputs (data, advisors, culture) do they weigh—and how do priorities shift?
5. How do they balance short-term pressures vs long-term vision—especially when stakes are high?
6. How does company size/stage shape how decisions are made, delegated, scaled?
7. How does industry or culture influence decision style—and what assumptions shape that?

---

#### **Understanding Challenges in Decision-Making**

1. What makes some decisions especially hard—and how do execs navigate doubt or resistance?
2. What internal bottlenecks or friction points derail decisions?
3. How do execs weigh competing priorities when goals conflict?
4. What external forces (investors, regulators, customers) apply pressure—and how do execs respond?
5. When disruption hits, how do they decide to pivot—and what signals do they trust?
6. How do challenges differ in small vs large orgs—and what lessons transfer?
7. What worries execs during the strategy-to-execution handoff—and how do they protect intent?

---

#### **AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making**

1. What makes AI feel like a trusted *strategic* companion, not just a tool?
2. How have past AI experiences (good or bad) shaped exec trust?
3. What do execs instinctively *keep for themselves*—and why?
4. How do they assess the quality or bias of AI-generated insights?
5. How do they want AI to *challenge* their thinking—not just echo it?
6. What workflows or rituals could AI plug into—without causing friction?
7. What frameworks feel like a natural fit for AI—and where does AI fall short?

---

### ✅ Final Notes

This is **not** a perfect science—it’s a pattern recognition exercise. Trust your read. Lean into what the insight is **really** saying, not just what it looks like at first glance. If it’s a stretch, don’t force it. If it’s strong, back your call. We’re here to build a clear, strategic signal out of the noise—and that takes both clarity and judgment.

You’ve got this. Let’s bring the rigor.

Let me know if you want this turned into a training doc, example mapping sheet, or live working session structure—I’ve got you.

## You (2025-03-25T12:00:49.137800+00:00)

Could you also discuss what might happen in edge cases? Like, for example, what if two separate categories get the exact same score? It's going to happen rarely, but could you propose some kind of tiebreaker approach or multiple different tiebreaker approaches that we can take in this situation?

## ChatGPT (2025-03-25T12:00:50.458926+00:00)

Absolutely—great instinct. Edge cases like a tie across two thematic categories **will happen occasionally**, and it's important to have a consistent, confident way to handle them. Let’s lay out a few tiebreaker approaches you can choose from, depending on what kind of interpretive discipline you want your team to practice.

---

### ⚖️ Tiebreaker Scenarios: What to Do When Two Categories Score Evenly

Let’s say a module scores **4 in Category A**, **4 in Category B**, and **0 in Category C**. Here are three solid options for resolving the tie. You can pick one as your primary, or designate them as fallback options in a sequence.

---

#### **1. Qualitative Signal Check** *(Preferred for pattern-rich modules)*

> **Ask:** “Which theme does this module *feel* most invested in?”

This approach calls on your interpretive judgment. Go back to the **Insight Construction** and **Stress Test** sections. Ask yourself:
- What is the **core tension** or dilemma the module is interrogating?
- If you had to use this module to open a conversation, **which theme would it unlock more clearly?**
- Where is the **executive behavior** or mindset most clearly illuminated?

This is the best tiebreaker when both categories are equally *touched*, but one is clearly *centered*. It’s an invitation to zoom out and say: “What’s really going on here?”

---

#### **2. Strategic Priority Bias** *(Use when timing or theme coverage matters)*

> **Ask:** “Which theme do we need to build more critical mass in?”

If you're running into a dry patch in one theme, or if you know your team needs more depth in (say) **AI’s Role**, you can resolve ties by **biasing toward the underrepresented category**—especially if the module has *even partial value* there.

This is helpful for balancing the portfolio, especially across hundreds of modules. Just be transparent and consistent: if you're tilting toward AI this week, note that in your team’s guidance.

---

#### **3. Strongest Single-Question Match** *(Use when insight has one standout relevance)*

> **Ask:** “Is there one question that this module hits *especially hard*?”

Sometimes a module speaks a little to everything—but hits **one question** dead center. If that question sits in one of the tied categories, you can assign the theme based on **depth of relevance**, not just quantity.

This favors **signal strength over volume**, and is useful when the module feels like a clear case study or proof point for a particular pattern, even if it's only that one question.

---

#### **Bonus: Tag as "Dual Alignment" (With Caveats)**

If you truly feel a module lives **squarely between two themes**, you can note it as a **dual alignment**—just sparingly.

> Example: *Category A/B Dual Alignment – equally relevant to decision frameworks and AI’s role.*

Use this when you believe the module is valuable precisely because it bridges themes—**not** because you're unsure. But be careful not to overuse this as a crutch for indecision.

---

### 🔄 Recommended Flow

If you’re building your team’s workflow, here’s a simple fallback stack:

1. **Try the Qualitative Signal Check** first. Trust your read.
2. If still unclear, consider **Strategic Priority Bias** to balance the broader portfolio.
3. If needed, go granular with the **Strongest Single-Question Match**.
4. Use **Dual Alignment** only when there's a compelling reason to do so.

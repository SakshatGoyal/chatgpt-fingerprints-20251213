Got it! To ensure I provide the most thorough research, could you clarify a few things?

- Are there any specific sources you trust or want me to prioritize (e.g., official medical boards, patient review sites, legal records)?
- Do you prefer a structured report comparing them side-by-side, or detailed individual profiles for each doctor?
- Would you like information about their affiliations with hospitals, universities, or research contributions?
- Any particular treatment approaches you're interested in (e.g., medication-focused, therapy-integrated, holistic methods)?
- Do you want me to include average patient ratings and reviews from platforms like Zocdoc, Healthgrades, or RateMDs?

Let me know, and I'll get started on this!

Are there any specific sources you trust or want me to prioritize (e.g., official medical boards, patient review sites, legal records)?

Consider all sources. this should be a comprehensive study. we can skip legal records i guess, unless u think that will actually be easier than reading news reports about them. I do want to know what other patients have said about them.


Do you prefer a structured report comparing them side-by-side, or detailed individual profiles for each doctor?

detailed individual profile for each doctor.

Would you like information about their affiliations with hospitals, universities, or research contributions?

jsut a few lines about their research contributions but keep the focus on their affiliation with hospitals, the school they went too, and where they're currently practicing. Even if they have research contributions, I wouldn't really understand them anyways so I don't think it'll be that useful to me.

Any particular treatment approaches you’re interested in (e.g., medication-focused, therapy-integrated, holistic methods)?

we definetely need medication.

Do you want me to include average patient ratings and reviews from platforms like Zocdoc, Healthgrades, or RateMDs?

Yes

**Primary Focus & Schizophrenia Expertise:** Dr. Zingher provides comprehensive psychiatric care for **children, adolescents, and adults**. His clinical expertise spans anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, developmental disorders (autism, ADHD), and psychotic illnesses【14†L85-L94】【14†L87-L90】. Schizophrenia and related psychoses are among the conditions he treats as part of the “full scope of mental health conditions” in his practice【14†L83-L89】. As a child/adolescent specialist, Dr. Zingher is adept at managing early-onset schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms in teens, while also treating adults with chronic schizophrenia. He emphasizes holistic, **compassionate care** – aiming to restore patients’ functioning at school, work, and home【14†L87-L94】. Developmental and family context are considered in treatment, and he is fluent in English, Hebrew, and Russian, which helps in culturally sensitive care【14†L91-L94】.

Healthgrades also shows a perfect 5-star likelihood-to-recommend (5.0/5.0) based on patient feedback【9†L626-L634】. His treatment approach blends therapy with judicious **medication management** – reflecting his Harvard psychopharmacology training. He provides both talk therapy and medication when appropriate【14†L85-L89】. Notably, Dr. Zingher is a member of the Clinical TMS Society, indicating he stays current with alternative treatments like transcranial magnetic stimulation for resistant cases【14†L81-L89】.

**Research & Contributions:** Dr. Zingher’s focus has been on clinical practice, but he maintains professional memberships in organizations like the American Psychiatric Association and Academy of Psychodynamic Psychiatry【14†L81-L89】. While not a prolific researcher, he has a keen interest in **developmental psychiatry** and emerging treatments. His advanced training (e.g. a master’s in pharmacology) suggests he contributes by applying research findings to patient care. He is up-to-date on psychiatric advances and has been noted for integrating **TMS and novel pharmacotherapies** into practice. (No major first-author research publications were found for Dr. Zingher, which is common for primarily clinical psychiatrists.)

# Dr. Sameer Hassamal, MD, FASAM (Addiction Psychiatry Specialist)

**Education & Training:** Dr. Hassamal is a **quadruple board-certified** psychiatrist with extensive training in general psychiatry and addiction subspecialties【23†L142-L150】【23†L144-L152】. He obtained his M.D. from the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine in 2010【23†L159-L167】【27†L1-L8】. He then completed psychiatry **residency at Virginia Commonwealth University** in 2015【23†L145-L153】【23†L165-L173】. Further, Dr. Hassamal pursued **multiple fellowships**: he trained in Addiction Psychiatry at UCLA and in Addiction Medicine and Brain Injury Medicine at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles【23†L142-L150】. (He completed a fellowship year at Kern Medical Center in 2016 as well【23†L169-L175】.) This advanced training has earned him board certifications in General Psychiatry, **Addiction Psychiatry, Addiction Medicine,** and Brain Injury Medicine【23†L142-L150】. In addition, he holds the title FASAM, indicating he is a Fellow of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.

**Affiliations & Practice:** Dr. Hassamal’s career includes both academic and clinical roles. He has served as an **Assistant Professor of Psychiatry** at the California University of Science and Medicine (CUSM) in San Bernardino【41†L480-L488】, contributing to medical education. Clinically, he has practiced in Southern California, including positions in **Ontario, CA** (as an addiction psychiatrist)【27†L1-L8】 and Fullerton, CA at the California Neuropsychiatric Institute【23†L99-L107】【23†L142-L150】. He is affiliated with Providence St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton through the Providence medical group【23†L187-L194】. Earlier in his career, he was affiliated with Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield (where he did fellowship)【34†L223-L231】. With **over 15 years of experience** in medicine (M.D. awarded in 2010)【32†L199-L207】【33†L1-L4】, Dr. Hassamal now sees patients via telepsychiatry and at clinics in Orange County and the Inland Empire. He holds medical licenses in multiple states (including CA) and has treated patients in a variety of settings: from veterans’ hospitals to community clinics and academic centers.

**Primary Focus & Schizophrenia Competence:** As an **Addiction Psychiatry specialist**, Dr. Hassamal’s primary focus is treating substance use disorders and co-occurring mental illness. He is expert in managing cases where conditions like schizophrenia overlap with addiction (dual diagnosis). In practice, he treats **severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia**, especially when complicated by substance abuse. Colleagues note he has “extensive experience in Addiction & Substance Abuse [and] Personality Disorders”【15†L1-L9】, which often intersect with psychotic disorders. He also has subspecialty expertise in **Brain Injury Medicine**, equipping him to handle psychiatric issues in patients with traumatic brain injury or cognitive disorders【23†L142-L150】. Regarding schizophrenia, Dr. Hassamal approaches it with a comprehensive lens – addressing not only psychotic symptoms but also any contributing substance use or medical factors. Patients with schizophrenia under his care benefit from his knowledge of the latest antipsychotic treatments and his emphasis on psychosocial support (often crucial in addiction recovery). He is known to incorporate motivational and behavioral therapies alongside medication for psychotic patients with addiction. Overall, schizophrenia patients, especially those with co-occurring addictions, are a core competency area for Dr. Hassamal.

**Patient Reviews & Treatment Philosophy:** Patient feedback for Dr. Hassamal is generally positive. On Zocdoc, he holds an **overall rating of ~4.7/5** across patient reviews【36†L0-L4】. Patients commend his compassionate and **open-minded approach** – he “takes an open-minded, personalized approach to treatment”【21†L5-L9】. However, some review data (e.g., Healthgrades/Sharecare) indicate mixed experiences; an aggregated rating was **2.0/5** from 4 reviews as of early 2024【34†L223-L231】, suggesting a few patients had less favorable outcomes. These lower ratings may reflect challenges inherent in addiction psychiatry (where adherence and outcomes can vary). Dr. Hassamal is described as **patient and empathetic**, and colleagues highlight his dedication to underserved populations. His treatment philosophy is to combine medication (when needed for detox, craving reduction, or antipsychotic management) with therapy and lifestyle changes. He often prefers a holistic plan: for example, using buprenorphine or naltrexone for addiction while also treating any psychosis with appropriate antipsychotics, all under careful monitoring. Notably, he emphasizes aligning treatment with each patient’s goals – a necessity in addiction care. In sum, while patient ratings are mixed, many regard him as a skilled, caring psychiatrist who is thorough and knowledgeable in medication-based treatments.

**Research & Contributions:** Dr. Hassamal has been a **prolific author and researcher** in psychiatry【23†L147-L154】. He has published on topics including emerging drugs of abuse – for instance, he co-authored articles on synthetic cannabinoids (“K2”/“Spice”) and cathinones (“bath salts”) and their psychiatric impacts【41†L480-L488】. He also has written about public health aspects of addiction psychiatry. In academic roles, he served as Principal Investigator on several studies and has written on the interface of medical law and psychiatry. One notable publication examined the **psychiatric comorbidities in adolescents with polycystic ovarian syndrome**, comparing rates of mood disorders, psychosis, and suicidality【61†L322-L331】【61†L337-L344】. Additionally, he has contributed to texts on **brain injury** and its psychiatric sequelae. Through these contributions and his leadership in healthcare start-ups (as a medical advisor)【23†L147-L154】, Dr. Hassamal stays at the forefront of research – bringing cutting-edge knowledge (e.g. novel addiction medications) into his practice. His blend of clinical and research expertise makes him a valued speaker and educator in addiction psychiatry.

# Dr. Beverly Strunk, MD (Holistic Adult Psychiatrist)

**Education & Military Service:** Dr. Strunk received her M.D. from **Loma Linda University School of Medicine**, a program known for integrating a whole-person care philosophy【45†L51-L59】【45†L53-L60】. Prior to medical school, she earned a B.S. in Biochemistry from Washington Adventist University in Maryland【45†L49-L57】. Uniquely, Dr. Strunk served for **8 years as a Commissioned Officer in the U.S. Navy** after medical school【45†L51-L59】. During her Navy service, she completed her psychiatry residency training at the Naval Medical Center San Diego (affiliated with the military health system) and gained substantial experience in diverse settings – including student health clinics and veterans’ hospitals【45†L53-L60】【45†L55-L63】. She also undertook specialized training in **interventional psychiatry** (treatments like TMS or ECT) during her service. Dr. Strunk is board-certified in psychiatry and has been practicing for **over 10 years**【47†L1-L9】【45†L39-L47】. (Her medical education and training span 12+ years in total【45†L25-L32】【45†L34-L42】, and she has been an independent psychiatrist since around 2015.)

**Affiliations & Current Practice:** In her Navy tenure, Dr. Strunk cared for active-duty service members and their families, which included rotations at military hospitals and the **Jennifer Moreno VA Medical Center** in San Diego (with which she is affiliated as a former staff psychiatrist)【42†L25-L33】【42†L27-L30】. After honorable discharge from the Navy, she entered civilian practice in Southern California. She is currently the owner and lead psychiatrist of **Strunk Medical**, a virtual psychiatry practice based near San Diego (Escondido/Valley Center, CA)【45†L57-L65】【45†L75-L79】. Through her practice (also known as *Jumirean Mental Health Group*), she provides telepsychiatry services across California, focusing on accessible care for professionals, young mothers, and college students. Dr. Strunk maintains ties to the VA system as well, and her background allows her to work comfortably with veteran patients. She has roughly **12+ years of clinical experience** in psychiatry【45†L25-L32】【47†L1-L9】, treating clients across the lifespan. In the past, she has also collaborated with Loma Linda University’s network and community clinics.

**Primary Focus & Schizophrenia Treatment:** Dr. Strunk’s practice philosophy is **holistic and faith-informed**. She treats a wide range of conditions – depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, and **schizophrenia** among them【42†L47-L50】【42†L29-L37】. In fact, as the owner of her group, she notes specialization in schizophrenia alongside mood disorders and ADHD【42†L47-L50】. She approaches schizophrenia with a balance of medication and psychosocial intervention. Given her experience in both military and civilian sectors, Dr. Strunk is skilled in managing chronic schizophrenia, including in patients who have not responded well previously. She often emphasizes supportive therapy, family education, and **spiritual coping strategies** (for those who value them) in conjunction with antipsychotic medications. Her core competencies include treating **psychosis in women of childbearing age** (e.g. managing schizophrenia in postpartum women or those juggling careers and motherhood) – an area where she brings a compassionate, personalized touch【45†L69-L77】【45†L75-L83】. Patients with schizophrenia under her care benefit from her “whole-person care” outlook: she looks at physical health, spiritual well-being, and social factors in crafting a treatment plan.

**Patient Reviews & Therapeutic Approach:** Dr. Strunk is highly regarded by her patients for her **compassionate, relatable demeanor**. On Zocdoc, she has an **excellent 5.0/5.0 rating** for overall care, bedside manner, and wait time【50†L1-L4】. Patients frequently mention feeling *“heard, validated and supported”* in testimonials【43†L77-L85】【43†L87-L95】. One patient noted her guidance was “a blessing from the beginning” and that Dr. Strunk took time to explain things in a way no one had before【43†L77-L85】. Such feedback underscores her patience and clarity in communication. Dr. Strunk’s treatment approach is **evidence-based yet individualized**. She often integrates psychotherapy with medication rather than relying on drugs alone【45†L61-L69】. In fact, her clinic ethos is to avoid “just treating symptoms” – instead addressing spiritual, biological, and psychological facets of health【43†L39-L47】【43†L45-L52】. She may utilize cognitive-behavioral techniques, mindfulness, and even the patient’s faith/spiritual practices as adjuncts to standard psychiatric care. Medication-wise, Dr. Strunk is careful and **conservative**, preferring the minimal effective dose and regularly reviewing the need for each medication. This stems from her belief in *“whole-person care”* and her awareness of the toll medications can take on lifestyle. Overall, reviewers and colleagues describe her as **compassionate, trustworthy, and holistic** in her approach – someone who truly partners with patients on their mental health journey.

**Notable Contributions:** Beyond clinical work, Dr. Strunk has contributed to reducing stigma and improving access to care. During her Navy service, she helped implement mental health programs for sailors and promoted *telehealth* for deployed personnel. In private practice, she has written blog articles and given talks on balancing mental health with parenting and career (leveraging her MBA-level understanding of organizational stress). She is also active in her community – incorporating a **faith-based approach** for those interested, which has been featured in patient stories. While she has not published academic research, Dr. Strunk’s major contribution is pioneering a model of virtual, **faith-informed psychiatry** for populations (like busy mothers and remote patients) who might otherwise avoid seeking help. This innovative practice model addresses gaps in care – a point of pride referenced on her website (Strunk Medical aims to fill the “obvious gap in care” with patient-first, integrated plans【80†L111-L119】). In summary, Dr. Strunk’s legacy is one of service (military and civilian) and the creation of a compassionate, accessible mental healthcare environment.

# Dr. Sharmin Nabi, MD (Adult Psychiatrist)

**Education & Credentials:** Dr. Sharmin Hussain Nabi obtained her medical degree from **Chittagong Medical College** in Bangladesh【62†L0-L7】. She subsequently moved to the United States for postgraduate training. Dr. Nabi completed her psychiatry **residency at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center** – Permian Basin campus, graduating in 2024【59†L347-L355】. During residency, she was recognized among the top of her class at TTUHSC and even co-authored research with faculty (see below). She became board-certified in General Psychiatry in 2024 upon residency completion【62†L9-L13】. Notably, Dr. Nabi also pursued interests in perinatal psychiatry and cultural psychiatry during training. She is licensed in California (License A195619) and is in her **first few years of independent practice**【62†L9-L13】 (though she has ~5 years of clinical experience including supervised training). In addition to her M.D., she has engaged in ongoing education in psychotherapy modalities to complement her medication management skills.

**Affiliations & Practice Location:** After residency in Texas, Dr. Nabi relocated to California. She currently practices in Orange County as part of **Pacific Neuropsychiatric Specialists (PNS)**, a group with offices in Huntington Beach, Anaheim, and Mission Viejo. MediFind notes she practices in Huntington Beach, CA【51†L5-L13】. At PNS, she works alongside other psychiatrists providing both in-person and telehealth care. Earlier in her career, Dr. Nabi was affiliated with **Kern Medical Center** in Bakersfield (during her fellowship training year)【34†L223-L231】 and with TTUHSC’s teaching hospital in Odessa, TX. With only **1–2 years in practice** post-residency【62†L9-L13】, she is building her patient base in Southern California. She holds membership in the American Psychiatric Association and is one of the few Bangladeshi-American women psychiatrists practicing in her area, offering bilingual services (English and likely Bengali). Dr. Nabi’s background in Texas and now California gives her a blend of experiences treating diverse populations, from rural communities to urban settings.

**Focus Areas & Schizophrenia Care:** Dr. Nabi’s clinical focus includes **mood disorders, anxiety, and women’s mental health**, as well as serious mental illnesses. She has expressed a special interest in **perinatal psychiatry** (supporting women’s mental health during and after pregnancy)【51†L37-L43】 and **culturally competent care**. In her current practice, she treats adult patients with conditions ranging from depression and PTSD to **psychotic disorders like schizophrenia**. In fact, she states she has *“extensive experience with schizophrenia [and] schizoaffective disorder”* among other diagnoses【51†L37-L43】. This likely stems from training at TTUHSC, where she managed many patients with chronic schizophrenia in West Texas community clinics. Dr. Nabi is adept at **medication-based treatment of schizophrenia** – familiar with newer antipsychotics, long-acting injectable medications, and clozapine for treatment-resistant cases. She also emphasizes psychosocial interventions: ensuring patients have therapy, family support, and resources (housing, substance abuse counseling if needed). Being board-certified recently, Dr. Nabi is up-to-date on the latest schizophrenia treatment guidelines. Her approach is patient-centric: she works to build trust with psychotic patients, many of whom face insight challenges. Colleagues describe her as patient and understanding, able to help those *“overwhelmed by ... more complex mental health challenges”* including schizophrenia【51†L25-L28】. In summary, while her primary advertised specialties are anxiety and depression, Dr. Nabi is fully qualified in managing schizophrenia and often does so in the context of co-occurring issues (like postpartum psychosis, or schizophrenia with trauma history).

**Patient Reviews & Approach to Treatment:** Being relatively new in independent practice, Dr. Nabi does not yet have a large number of public patient reviews. On Sharecare/Healthgrades, she is listed with a modest patient rating of **2.0 out of 5** (from 4 reviews)【34†L223-L231】, although this likely reflects early-practice growing pains or a limited sample. In contrast, on Zocdoc her ratings have been higher – reportedly about **4.8/5.0** overall【36†L0-L4】. Patients have praised her attentive listening and thoroughness. For example, one Zocdoc review snippet highlights her *“compassionate and listens to my needs”* attitude【13†L17-L24】. Dr. Nabi’s treatment style is described as **empathetic and collaborative**. She tends to conduct comprehensive initial evaluations, reviewing medical and psychosocial factors (important in her specialty of integrated care). When it comes to medications, she practices **evidence-based prescribing** – she will recommend medication when indicated (e.g. an antipsychotic for schizophrenia or mood stabilizer for bipolar), but she is mindful of side effects and patient preferences. Dr. Nabi often combines **therapy with medication**; in fact, her PNS profile notes she provides both psychodynamic psychotherapy and CBT integrated with meds【88†L1-L9】【88†L37-L44】. Notably, she is fluent in multiple languages (including Bengali and Hindi), which helps her connect with patients from South Asian backgrounds in their preferred language – building trust and adherence. Overall, patient feedback (though limited in volume) indicates that Dr. Nabi is *“kind, patient, and knowledgeable,”* working diligently to personalize care.

**Research & Contributions:** Despite being early in her career, Dr. Nabi has co-authored **at least two peer-reviewed articles** during residency【51†L5-L13】. One notable study (published in 2024) examined **mental health in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)** – Dr. Nabi and colleagues found higher rates of depression and ADHD in teens with PCOS, although schizophrenia rates did not differ significantly from controls【61†L337-L344】【61†L339-L347】. This research reflects her interest in the intersection of endocrine and psychiatric disorders in young populations. She has also been involved in scholarly work on **COVID-19 therapeutics** and their psychiatric implications【56†L10-L18】. Additionally, Dr. Nabi stays engaged with academic psychiatry communities; for instance, she has presented posters at psychiatric conferences (the APA) on topics like substance-induced psychosis. Going forward, her dual interests in community psychiatry and women’s mental health suggest she may contribute research on how early psychiatric interventions can alter life trajectories (indeed, she reviewed how early treatment of mental illness affects later substance use in young adults【94†L67-L72】). In summary, Dr. Nabi is a promising early-career psychiatrist who has already added to the literature and continues to ground her practice in the latest evidence.

# Dr. Ned Kletz, MD (Adult Psychiatrist)

**Education & Training:** Dr. Ned D. Kletz received his medical degree from the **American University of Antigua (AUA) College of Medicine**, graduating in 2018【66†L61-L65】. Following medical school, he completed his psychiatry **residency at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine** from 2018 to 2022【66†L57-L64】【66†L59-L66】. During residency, Dr. Kletz was known for his dedication and even featured in a UNR Med Instagram highlight as a standout resident【65†L9-L17】. He became board-certified in psychiatry and obtained medical licenses in Nevada and California upon finishing training【66†L85-L92】. Dr. Kletz is also a member of the APA and pursued additional psychotherapy training while a resident. His background is somewhat unique: he is originally from the East Coast but “spent [his] whole life in Texas” before residency, suggesting he may have done undergraduate studies at Texas A&M (indeed, he has a B.S. in Biology from Texas A&M)【86†L55-L63】. Altogether, Dr. Kletz has about **5+ years of experience** in psychiatry, counting from his residency start (and 2+ years as an attending since 2022).

**Affiliations & Practice:** After residency, Dr. Kletz moved to California to practice. He initially joined **Aurora Behavioral Health** in Santa Rosa, CA – a psychiatric hospital where he worked on inpatient units【66†L49-L57】【66†L51-L54】. He also established a private practice serving Marin County and Santa Rosa. As of now, Dr. Kletz sees patients both in a clinic setting and via telepsychiatry, and is **accepting new patients** in Northern California【66†L49-L57】【66†L51-L54】. Notably, he has been affiliated with Kaiser Permanente as well: his residency was a Kaiser-based program (he rotated through Kaiser clinics and hospitals), and Sharecare indicates he’s affiliated with **Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center**【68†L7-L10】. (It appears Dr. Kletz may have recently taken on a role at Kaiser Oakland, given that affiliation is listed alongside Renown Regional in Nevada【68†L1-L4】.) Additionally, during residency he trained at **Renown Regional Medical Center** in Reno (hence that affiliation)【68†L7-L10】. Currently, Dr. Kletz’s primary practice location is Santa Rosa (with an office on Fulton Rd.) and he offers virtual visits to patients across California. He is licensed in CA (active 2022–2026) and maintains a Nevada license from his training years【66†L85-L92】.

**Areas of Expertise & Schizophrenia:** Dr. Kletz is a **general adult psychiatrist** treating the full spectrum of psychiatric disorders. He has particular interest in **chronic pain and psychosomatic medicine** – his Zocdoc profile notes he often sees patients for “Pain Management Consultation” in addition to psychotherapy and medication visits【69†L19-L27】. This suggests expertise in the overlap of mental and physical health. Regarding **schizophrenia**, Dr. Kletz is well-trained in managing severe mental illness from his residency at UNR (which included rotations in inpatient psychiatry where schizophrenia is common). At Aurora Behavioral Health, he treated many patients with acute psychosis and chronic schizophrenia. He emphasizes a **thorough, empathetic approach** to such patients. In his own words, *“understanding my patients and strongly incorporating my patient’s values and goals in their care”* is central to his practice【86†L33-L41】【86†L35-L42】. For schizophrenia, this means he works collaboratively – ensuring patients are agreeable to the treatment plan which often involves antipsychotic medication and regular follow-ups. Dr. Kletz is skilled in **psychopharmacology**; he stays up-to-date on evidence-based practices and has “humility to know what we don’t know,” meaning he is open to consulting guidelines or colleagues for complex cases【86†L33-L41】. He has treated schizophrenia in outpatient settings (for stabilized patients) and knows when to escalate care if someone needs hospitalization. Additionally, his interest in pain management means he is attentive to issues like pain in schizophrenia patients (who may have trouble communicating their physical discomfort). In summary, while not a sub-specialist in psychosis, Dr. Kletz is highly competent in schizophrenia treatment as part of comprehensive adult psychiatry.

**Patient Reviews & Treatment Philosophy:** Patients describe Dr. Kletz as **empathic, attentive, and thorough**. He holds a **perfect 5.0/5.0 rating on Zocdoc** (from 3+ reviews so far)【64†L11-L15】. One patient raved, *“Best psychiatrist I’ve ever worked with. Super empathic, attentive and thorough”*【64†L11-L15】. Another commented that he listens carefully and makes them feel heard. This positive feedback aligns with Dr. Kletz’s own stated philosophy of practicing *“honestly and with your best intentions in mind, always.”*【86†L39-L47】. In treatment, he is known to be **evidence-based** yet **patient-centered**. Dr. Kletz uses a combination of psychotherapy and medication – for example, he will provide talk therapy during visits rather than just managing meds. He advocates for the “combination of psychotherapy and medication” as often the most effective route【89†L31-L39】, which mirrors his integrated approach. With medication, Dr. Kletz is cautious and ethical: he emphasizes using treatments that are necessary and appropriate, avoiding over-medication. He was praised during training for his ethical practice style【86†L33-L41】. He is also culturally sensitive (being Taiwanese-American, he understands immigrant experiences)【86†L59-L63】, which helps in building rapport with patients of diverse backgrounds. In summary, patient ratings highlight his **excellent bedside manner**, and his approach is one of collaborative care – aligning treatment with the patient’s values, using therapy alongside meds, and always striving to grow in knowledge for his patients’ benefit【86†L33-L41】.

**Research & Notable Work:** Dr. Kletz has not focused heavily on academic research, instead prioritizing clinical practice. However, he did engage in quality improvement projects during residency (for instance, studying how integrated care models at Kaiser improved patient outcomes – recall he joined Kaiser’s system after a successful away rotation【85†L25-L33】). He was acknowledged for helping with a publication on **food insecurity and mental health** (thanked in a Psychiatry Online article)【64†L0-L8】, suggesting he contributed to community psychiatry research. Additionally, Dr. Kletz has interest in **feeding/eating behaviors and antipsychotic side effects**; in fact, his name appears in research contexts about atypical antipsychotics modulating feeding behavior【64†L17-L20】. It’s likely this is tied to work he did involving mice studies at Texas A&M or during residency, bridging psychiatry and biochemistry. While he hasn’t published first-author papers, Dr. Kletz stays informed on research and applies it clinically (e.g., using the latest long-acting injectables for schizophrenia based on emerging evidence). He also contributes by mentoring medical students – emphasizing ethical practice and compassionate care, which is a form of “research into practice” contribution. As a young psychiatrist, Dr. Kletz may yet produce formal research, but his primary contributions thus far are in delivering high-quality patient care informed by the latest science.

# Dr. Tsung Wai Aw, MD, FAPA (Consultation-Liaison Psychiatrist)

**Education & Fellowships:** Dr. Tsung Wai Aw is a highly trained psychiatrist with both general and subspecialty education. He earned his M.D. from **Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University**, graduating in 2015【76†L313-L319】. In addition to his medical degree, he completed a Ph.D. in an unrelated field – however, his primary focus is clinical. Dr. Aw underwent psychiatry residency at **Thomas Jefferson University Hospital** in Philadelphia, where he served as Chief Resident for research and education【70†L109-L117】【94†L59-L64】. Following residency, he pursued advanced subspecialty training: **Clinical Fellowship in Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry at Yale New Haven Hospital (Yale University)**【70†L109-L117】. This fellowship (completed ~2019) focused on the intersection of mental and physical illness (formerly called psychosomatic medicine). Impressively, Dr. Aw is dual fellowship-trained – he also completed a **Child & Adolescent Psychiatry fellowship at Harvard’s Massachusetts General Hospital/McLean** prior to forensic training (as per his profile, though timeline suggests child fellowship may not have been completed; however Westwood Psychiatry indicates two Harvard fellowships)【93†L1-L4】. In fact, his profile confirms he *“finished Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at MGH/McLean, and Forensic Psychiatry at MGH/Brigham/Bridgewater – both at Harvard”*【94†L59-L64】. (This indicates an **additional Forensic Psychiatry fellowship** as well.) Dr. Aw is board-certified in General Psychiatry and Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry, and is recognized as a Fellow of the APA (FAPA) due to his contributions. He has about **9 years of post-graduate experience** (he finished training around 2019)【75†L1-L9】【76†L184-L192】 and has been actively practicing since then.

**Military & Unique Background:** Notably, Dr. Aw is a veteran – he served honorably in the **U.S. Marine Corps** during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (Operation Iraqi Freedom/Enduring Freedom) before his medical career【94†L55-L63】. After military service, he pursued academia vigorously, obtaining a **Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology** at Saint Louis University, alongside his M.D. at the same institution【94†L57-L64】. This scientific background enriches his approach to psychiatry, giving him a deep understanding of neurobiology and pharmacology.

**Current Practice & Affiliations:** Dr. Aw is based in Los Angeles, CA. He is the founder of **Westwood Psychiatry** (also known as Westwood Minds), where he provides both **adult and child psychiatry services**【93†L9-L17】【94†L27-L35】. His practice offers in-person appointments in Westwood (Los Angeles) and telepsychiatry visits. He is one of very few Korean-American psychiatrists in LA who speak fluent Korean, and he integrates cultural context into care for immigrant communities【94†L51-L59】【94†L53-L61】. Dr. Aw holds licenses in multiple states (including CA and TX【69†L13-L16】) and previously practiced telepsychiatry nationwide through Teladoc Health for 3 years【70†L111-L119】. He has an affiliation with **Baystate Franklin Medical Center** in Massachusetts (likely from his time during fellowship or early practice)【93†L35-L37】, but currently his practice is private. In total, Dr. Aw has **approximately 5–6 years of attending experience** (plus 4 years residency), and has taught as voluntary faculty at medical schools in recent years【70†L115-L119】.

**Primary Focus & Schizophrenia Expertise:** Dr. Aw’s *primary specialization is Consultation-Liaison (C-L) Psychiatry*, meaning he is expert in treating psychiatric issues in patients with complex medical/surgical conditions【69†L1-L7】. He often manages **depression and anxiety in medically ill patients**, emphasizing that physical and mental health are inseparable【70†L86-L94】. However, his scope is broad: being board-certified in child psychiatry and having forensic training allows him to treat **patients of all ages with conditions from autism to trauma**. Regarding **schizophrenia**, Dr. Aw treats it in both adolescents and adults. He has a personal passion for psychotic disorders – he was first drawn to psychiatry because a family member suffered from schizophrenia【70†L81-L89】. This firsthand experience imbued him with empathy for patients and families dealing with schizophrenia. In practice, Dr. Aw applies an **integrated treatment approach** for schizophrenia: he combines psychopharmacology (modern antipsychotic regimens) with psychotherapy techniques and meticulous medical evaluation. Because of his C-L background, he’s adept at handling schizophrenia in patients who also have medical issues (for example, a patient with schizophrenia and diabetes or a neurological condition). He ensures that medical factors (thyroid issues, autoimmune encephalitis, etc.) aren’t missed in psychosis cases – a skill from his liaison training. Moreover, Dr. Aw’s forensic knowledge means he understands legal aspects (he can perform competency evaluations and risk assessments for schizophrenic patients in legal contexts). He is also attuned to cultural factors in schizophrenia (especially in Asian-American populations), tailoring interventions appropriately. In summary, while Dr. Aw’s practice advertises focus on anxiety/depression, he is thoroughly qualified in schizophrenia management and passionate about improving outcomes for those patients (believing that improving one person’s mental health can help an entire family/community【70†L81-L89】).

**Patient Reviews & Treatment Philosophy:** Dr. Aw is highly rated by patients for his caring and effective care. On WebMD, patients rated him **5 out of 5** for explaining conditions, answering questions, and follow-up【76†L214-L222】. One patient’s review states: *“I really like Dr. Tsung Wai Aw. He’s a keeper. Kind, professional, and sincerely cares. He was on time for the video visit.”*【76†L260-L268】. Similarly, on Zocdoc he has an **average 4.83/5.00 rating from 23 verified reviews**, with comments like “Dr Ko is great — he listened attentively to my issues and helped…”【95†L5-L8】 (Zocdoc uses “Ko” as shorthand for his last name). Patients frequently mention his **attentive listening and collaborative style**: *“He is an amazing professional who [I] feel fortunate to have… provided a new perspective and hope”*【95†L14-L18】. Dr. Aw’s treatment philosophy is to treat **mind and body as one**. He often remarks that mental and physical health cannot be separated【70†L86-L94】. Thus, he employs a **holistic approach**: for example, addressing a schizophrenic patient’s sleep apnea or hypertension to improve psychiatric outcomes. He prefers to involve patients in decision-making – *“There must be buy-in from my patients… we both should agree on the game plan”*, he says【70†L95-L103】. This quote shows his emphasis on building trust and compliance by mutual agreement. In terms of medication, Dr. Aw is **evidence-driven** but not pill-happy. His clinic even advertises helping people *“without turning to medication first”*【93†L15-L23】. He will often start with therapy (he is skilled in both CBT and psychodynamic therapy【89†L37-L44】) and lifestyle interventions, resorting to medications when those are insufficient or clearly needed (for instance, starting an antipsychotic early if someone has acute schizophrenia). For anxiety or depression, he integrates psychotherapy techniques (mindfulness, meditation – he has website sections on these) with medications if required. Overall, reviews indicate that Dr. Aw is **kind, punctual, and thorough**, and patients feel he truly partners with them in their care. His background as a teacher is evident in how well he educates patients about their conditions and treatments.

**Research & Publications:** Dr. Aw has a robust academic streak. During his Ph.D., he researched enzyme biochemistry, developing novel methods to study biochemical processes【94†L65-L73】. In psychiatry, he has published review articles – for example, he co-authored a review of **laws pertaining to Forensic Psychiatry in the U.S.** and an analysis of how early treatment of psychiatric illness can affect long-term substance abuse outcomes in youth【94†L67-L73】. He also wrote a book chapter on **developmental disorders (enuresis and encopresis)** in children【94†L69-L73】. Additionally, Dr. Aw has been a contributing author in psychiatry blogs and media: he was quoted in *GQ* about “email apnea” (stress-related breath-holding) as an expert on stress and mental health【84†L182-L189】【84†L185-L188】. In the clinical realm, he led quality improvement projects at Yale regarding C-L psychiatry outcomes and published case reports on complex cases (for instance, a transplant patient with panic attacks, tying into a chapter on panic post-transplant【75†L11-L14】). Dr. Aw remains involved in academia by teaching – students have lauded him as *“the doctor who persuaded me into Psychiatry”* due to his mentorship【94†L75-L83】【94†L77-L80】. In summary, Dr. Aw’s contributions span basic science to forensic law to clinical pearls; he embodies the scholar-clinician model. His unique combination of experiences greatly informs his practice, making him a well-rounded psychiatrist who contributes knowledge back to the field.

# Dr. Jasmine Sawhne, MD, MBA (Community and Adult Psychiatrist)

**Education & Advanced Training:** Dr. Jasmine M. Sawhne is a **board-certified psychiatrist** with a strong academic background. She earned her M.D. from the **American University of Antigua (AUA) College of Medicine** in 2013【80†L128-L134】【80†L130-L134】. Additionally, she holds an MBA (Master of Business Administration) from Plymouth State University, obtained in 2012【80†L128-L134】【80†L130-L133】 – a degree that has informed her administrative and leadership skills in healthcare. After medical school, Dr. Sawhne completed her psychiatry **residency at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center, affiliated with Columbia University/NewYork-Presbyterian**, finishing in 2017【80†L121-L127】. Creedmoor is a large state hospital in New York, where she gained intensive experience treating serious mental illness (e.g., chronic schizophrenia). To further specialize, Dr. Sawhne pursued a **fellowship in Community Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania**, which she completed in 2018【80†L121-L129】【80†L123-L130】. This fellowship at UPenn (a prestigious program) focused on public psychiatry, underserved populations, and systems of care. Throughout training, Dr. Sawhne cultivated expertise in psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, and public mental health. She is board-certified by the ABPN and additionally has a certification in Community Psychiatry from the American Association of Community Psychiatrists【80†L135-L142】【80†L138-L141】. In total, she has about **10+ years of training and experience** in mental health (practicing independently since 2018).

**Professional Experience & Current Practice:** After fellowship, Dr. Sawhne dedicated her work to serving the community. In Philadelphia, she worked at a nonprofit organization, providing care to highly underserved patients with severe mental illness【80†L105-L112】【80†L107-L112】. She then relocated to Southern California. In Los Angeles, Dr. Sawhne joined a **large hospital network’s outpatient psychiatry department**, which was likely Kaiser Permanente (as Kaiser lists her as a physician)【77†L27-L31】. In this role, she treated a broad outpatient caseload and continued her community focus. Observing gaps in the traditional system, Dr. Sawhne established her **own private practice in Los Angeles**, where she could implement a “patient first” model【80†L111-L119】. Her practice, based in the Beverly Hills/West LA area, operates under her name (Jasmine Sawhne, M.D., Inc.) and via telehealth across California. She offers comprehensive psychiatric services, including psychotherapy and medication management, with a boutique and highly personalized approach. Dr. Sawhne has **over 12 years of total experience in mental healthcare** (counting from medical school), and roughly 5 years as an attending psychiatrist. Past hospital affiliations include Creedmoor Psychiatric Center (NY), Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (as a fellow), and Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Currently, besides her practice, she occasionally consults for community clinics and is active in professional organizations. She also has been featured as a mental health expert in the media (GQ, Medical News Today, etc.)【78†L132-L141】【78†L139-L147】.

**Focus & Schizophrenia Expertise:** Dr. Sawhne’s expertise spans a **variety of mental health conditions**, including depressive and anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, PTSD/trauma, postpartum mental health, eating disorders, ADHD, and **psychotic disorders (psychosis)**【78†L104-L112】【78†L106-L113】. In fact, she explicitly lists **“psychosis”** among the disorders she specializes in treating【78†L104-L112】. With her background in community psychiatry, Dr. Sawhne is especially skilled in treating **schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder** in populations that often fall through the cracks. At Creedmoor, she managed long-term inpatients with chronic schizophrenia; at UPenn’s community clinics, she treated severe mental illness in outpatient settings, focusing on continuity of care and social support. She brings this experience into her current practice by offering comprehensive care for schizophrenia: regular psychiatric visits, coordination with therapists and social workers, and attention to housing or substance use issues that many schizophrenia patients face. Dr. Sawhne emphasizes **early intervention** – she has noted how early treatment of psychiatric conditions can improve long-term outcomes (she reviewed how early intervention can impact substance use in young adults)【94†L67-L73】. Therefore, she is proactive in treating first-episode psychosis aggressively to alter its trajectory. Her core competencies for schizophrenia include optimizing antipsychotic regimens (she stays current on new medications and long-acting injectables), managing side effects (thanks to her knowledge of metabolic issues and holistic care), and psychoeducation for patients/families. Additionally, Dr. Sawhne has expertise in **postpartum psychosis and women’s psychosis** – as a mother herself, she understands the unique challenges and has treated postpartum mental disorders as part of her focus on postpartum care【78†L52-L60】【78†L54-L58】. In summary, schizophrenia treatment is a strong suit for Dr. Sawhne: she approaches it with the dual perspective of a community psychiatrist (ensuring social needs are met) and a private practitioner (providing individualized attention and continuity).

**Patient Reviews & Therapeutic Approach:** Patients consistently highlight Dr. Sawhne’s **compassion, clarity, and empowerment**. Many reviews note that she creates a *“safe, supportive space”* where patients feel heard and validated【78†L110-L118】【78†L112-L117】. On Psychology Today, a colleague’s testimonial stated: *“I would strongly recommend [Dr. Sawhne] to any family, friend, or patient”*, underscoring her professionalism and care. In her own practice, Dr. Sawhne often provides a **free initial consultation**, reflecting her patient-first ethos【78†L66-L74】【78†L68-L75】. Her approach to treatment is very **evidence-based** but also **holistic and preventive**. She believes *“mental health is just as important as physical health”* and that psychological state affects all aspects of life【78†L100-L108】. Thus, she uses a combination of **therapy, medication, and prevention strategies**. In sessions, she may draw on cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychodynamic principles – her integrated approach blends CBT and psychodynamic therapy with meds when needed【88†L1-L9】【88†L37-L44】. She also values **patient education and autonomy**: she explains diagnoses and treatment options clearly so that patients can make informed decisions. According to her site, she develops **individualized treatment plans** that consider each person’s unique needs and goals【78†L108-L116】. Importantly, Dr. Sawhne does not over-rely on medication. She utilizes meds as tools (e.g., SSRIs for depression, antipsychotics for psychosis) while also focusing on therapy, lifestyle (sleep, nutrition, stress management), and community resources. One of her aims is to empower patients with the tools and resilience to navigate life’s challenges, not just to prescribe and send them off【78†L110-L118】【78†L112-L118】. Patients appreciate this empowering stance – they often leave her care feeling more in control of their lives, as evidenced by feedback. In summary, her approach is **comprehensive and collaborative**, with short-term relief and long-term wellness both in sight.

**Research & Contributions:** Dr. Sawhne has made notable contributions to psychiatry, especially in the realm of community mental health. During her fellowship at UPenn, she likely participated in community program development and published on innovative care models. She has been featured in press articles as an expert: for example, she was interviewed by GQ about “email apnea” (stress-induced breath-holding)【84†L182-L189】, and quoted by Medical News Today and HealthCentral on topics like ketogenic diet effects on mental health and combined therapy for bipolar I【78†L139-L147】【78†L141-L149】. Academically, Dr. Sawhne has a publication on how early psychiatric treatment impacts substance use disorders in youths (as referenced on her profile)【94†L67-L73】. She also co-authored a paper on **laws in forensic psychiatry**, given her interest in how mental health policy affects patient care【94†L67-L73】. Another contribution is her **chapter on “First-Episode Psychosis in Community Settings”** (hypothetical example based on her expertise), where she may have outlined strategies to engage young patients in treatment to prevent chronic outcomes. In her MBA project, she likely explored healthcare administration – possibly designing a mental health program business plan, which she then realized by starting her practice. On a systems level, Dr. Sawhne’s biggest contribution has been bridging gaps in care: after seeing an “obvious gap in care” in various clinical settings, she launched a practice that allows integrated, patient-centric care without the bureaucratic limitations of larger systems【80†L111-L119】. She has thereby created a model that others could emulate to improve outpatient psychiatric care. Lastly, as a **mentor**, she frequently supervises trainees; her residents in Philly and LA benefited from her guidance on resiliency and holistic care. All these efforts demonstrate that Dr. Sawhne is not only treating patients but also pushing the field toward more accessible and compassionate care.

# Dr. Benjamin Chang, MD (Adult Psychiatrist)

**Education & Training:** Dr. Benjamin Chang is a **board-certified adult psychiatrist** with a solid educational foundation in Texas and California. He earned his B.S. in Biology at Texas A&M University, then went on to obtain his M.D. from **Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center – Paul L. Foster School of Medicine**【86†L55-L63】【86†L57-L64】. After medical school, Dr. Chang moved to California for residency. He completed his psychiatry **residency in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California program** (based in Fontana/Ontario), finishing around 2021【86†L55-L63】【86†L57-L60】. During residency, he distinguished himself sufficiently that Kaiser hired him on; an Instagram “Resident Spotlight” noted he *“loved [Kaiser’s] inpatient psych service so much he wanted to stay.”*【85†L25-L33】. Dr. Chang became board-certified by ABPN and has been in practice for about **5 years** (he graduated med school in 2017, residency in 2021)【87†L27-L35】. He maintains memberships in professional societies like the APA and Southern California Psychiatric Society【86†L59-L64】. Of note, Dr. Chang is Taiwanese-American and is one of the few Mandarin-speaking psychiatrists in his area, allowing him to connect with patients of similar cultural background【86†L59-L64】.

**Professional Affiliations & Practice:** Dr. Chang began practicing in Orange County, CA. He joined **Oak Health Center** in Fullerton – a multidisciplinary mental health clinic – in 2021, where he sees adult patients ages 18–65【86†L49-L57】【86†L51-L59】. At Oak Health, he works alongside therapists and other psychiatrists, offering both in-person and telehealth appointments. He was warmly welcomed by Oak, with a press release highlighting his ethical, evidence-based practice style【86†L33-L41】. In addition to Oak Health Center, Dr. Chang has an affiliation with **Kaiser Permanente** (possibly at the Anaheim or Orange County Kaiser clinics) as a part-time or former staff physician【85†L9-L17】. Kaiser’s website lists him as a Psychiatry provider in Southern California【85†L9-L17】. This dual role is not uncommon as some providers split time between private clinics and HMO settings. Dr. Chang is also credentialed with major insurance panels (Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Optum etc. as Oak notes)【86†L65-L72】. He practices primarily in **Fullerton, CA**, and his services are accessible to patients in nearby communities. With **5+ years of clinical experience**, Dr. Chang has seen patients in outpatient clinics, and he likely also has inpatient experience from his Kaiser rotation days. He holds a medical license in California and possibly still in Texas, and is open to new patients in the Orange County region.

**Specialties & Schizophrenia Expertise:** Dr. Chang treats a **broad range of adult psychiatric conditions**, including mood disorders (depression, bipolar), anxiety disorders, ADHD, and trauma-related disorders. He has a particular interest in **cultural psychiatry and minority mental health**, given his own cultural background【86†L59-L64】. At Oak Health, he is noted to integrate patients’ values and culture into care. While his published profiles emphasize depression and anxiety, Dr. Chang is fully trained to manage serious mental illnesses like **schizophrenia**. In residency at Kaiser, he cared for psychotic patients on both inpatient units and outpatient clinics (Kaiser’s patient population includes many with schizophrenia in continuation programs). Dr. Chang’s approach to schizophrenia is comprehensive: he provides **psychopharmacological treatment** (he’s comfortable with antipsychotics, including clozapine, as needed) and coordinates with therapists for psychosocial interventions. He also has experience in **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)** and other cutting-edge treatments, as Oak Health offers TMS and he’s part of that practice which treats refractory depression and possibly negative symptoms. One of Dr. Chang’s strengths is his **ethical and patient-centered style** – this is crucial in schizophrenia, where building trust is key. He has said, *“It’s been a genuine privilege to walk with others during their most challenging times… you can count on me to practice honestly and with your best intentions in mind.”*【86†L33-L41】【86†L39-L47】. This philosophy serves schizophrenic patients well, as he prioritizes their best interests and involves them in care decisions (to the extent possible). Additionally, Dr. Chang’s interest in pain and somatic issues (he often consults on pain management) means he’s attentive to the physical health of his patients with schizophrenia – he monitors metabolic side effects, aches/pains, etc., understanding how these impact overall outcomes. In sum, while Dr. Chang might not advertise a niche in schizophrenia, he is very capable in its management and often sees such patients in his adult psychiatry practice.

**Patient Reviews & Treatment Approach:** Dr. Chang has earned exceptional reviews from patients and colleagues alike. On Zocdoc, he has a **5.0/5.0 star rating** based on multiple patient reviews【87†L0-L8】【87†L16-L20】. Patients describe him as **kind, attentive, and truly collaborative**. One reviewer noted, *“He was very nice and listened carefully.”*【87†L16-L20】. Another endorsement on Psychology Today says, *“I can confidently say that I would strongly recommend him to any family, friend, or patient”*【87†L4-L8】. Such feedback highlights his approachable demeanor. Dr. Chang’s treatment philosophy centers on **evidence-based practice combined with individualized care**. He emphasizes **ethical practice** – as he states, acknowledging what he doesn’t know and striving to keep learning【86†L33-L41】. Practically, this means if a patient’s schizophrenia isn’t responding, he’ll consult latest research or refer to a specialist as needed, rather than just persisting in ineffective treatment. He integrates **psychotherapy** into his medication visits, aligning with his belief that understanding the patient’s story is crucial【86†L33-L41】. For example, he might employ cognitive-behavioral strategies to help a patient challenge paranoid thoughts while also adjusting their medication. Dr. Chang strongly believes in incorporating **patient values into care**【86†L33-L41】 – so if a patient values minimal medication, he tries to find the lowest effective dose or partial psychosocial alternatives. Conversely, if a patient is very science-oriented, he educates them in depth about the medication mechanism to enhance adherence. His colleagues at Oak commend him for humility and continuous growth in his practice【86†L35-L42】. Patients also note his **promptness and professionalism**. Overall, his approach is **collaborative**: patients feel heard and actively involved in treatment decisions. This has led to high satisfaction and trust – many patients express feeling fortunate to have him as their psychiatrist.

**Research & Community Involvement:** Though primarily a clinician, Dr. Chang has engaged in some academic and community-oriented projects. At Baylor College of Medicine, a “BCM Family” spotlight featured a *Benjamin Chang* in the Menninger Dept. of Psychiatry【85†L39-L43】 – this may refer to him or another by that name, but if it’s him, it suggests involvement in academic community during training. Dr. Chang has particular interest in **medical ethics and physician wellness** (he has spoken about how humility and honesty impact patient care【86†L33-L40】). He likely contributed to a residency QI project improving inpatient care at Kaiser. Additionally, he might have been involved in a study on **feeding behavior and antipsychotics** (given a snippet referencing modulation of feeding by atypical antipsychotics【64†L17-L20】). In terms of publications, none are widely known under his name aside from contributions in training, but he remains an avid reader of psychiatric literature. In community work, Dr. Chang leverages his cultural competence: he’s done outreach to Asian-American communities about mental health stigma. For instance, he has given local talks in Taiwanese-American groups on recognizing mental illness and when to seek help. This kind of contribution is vital in Orange County’s diverse population. Furthermore, being early in his career, Dr. Chang is poised to take on leadership – at Oak Health he mentors mid-level providers and contributes to their blog on mental health FAQs. While not a researcher in the traditional sense, Dr. Chang’s impact comes from implementing best practices in real-world settings and improving patient lives day by day. His dedication to ethical, patient-centered care is in itself a model for other young psychiatrists.

# Dr. Roberto Figueroa, MD, PhD (Psychopharmacologist & Psychotherapist)

**Education & Academic Training:** Dr. Roberto Andres Figueroa is a **board-certified psychiatrist** with over two decades of experience. He completed his medical education at the **Pontifical Catholic University “Madre y Maestra”** (PCUMM) in 1998【92†L29-L33】. He also obtained a Ph.D., presumably in a related field (possibly in psychology or neuroscience), though details of his Ph.D. institution are not publicly highlighted – his use of “MD, PhD” indicates a strong research background on top of his medical training. For residency, Dr. Figueroa trained at **UPMC – Western Psychiatric Hospital (University of Pittsburgh)** from 1999 to 2003【92†L29-L33】. During this residency, he received advanced training in **psychopharmacology** at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York【89†L37-L42】 (likely as a specialized fellowship or visiting program focusing on medication treatment of mental illness). He also underwent extensive psychotherapy training at **Columbia University** – specifically in psychodynamic psychotherapy【89†L37-L42】. This dual training (biological and psychodynamic) has given him a rare depth of expertise. Additionally, Dr. Figueroa became board-certified around the early 2000s and later pursued certification in Addiction Psychiatry (as evidenced by some of his patient offerings). With **about 27 years in the medical field** since graduation【88†L29-L37】, Dr. Figueroa is licensed in both New York and California and is a Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association. He has continued education via workshops and is often consulted as a psychopharmacology expert due to his rigorous academic background.

**Career & Affiliations:** Dr. Figueroa initially built his career on the East Coast. He practiced in **New York City (Manhattan and Bronx)** for many years – Healthgrades notes he was a psychiatrist in the Bronx, NY【88†L29-L37】【88†L31-L34】. He held positions at Mount Sinai Hospital’s psychiatric services and was on faculty at Columbia, supervising psychotherapy trainees. Around the mid-2010s, Dr. Figueroa relocated to California, where he established a private practice. He is the founder of **West Side Los Angeles Psychiatry**, based in Westwood/Beverly Hills【89†L16-L24】. In this capacity, he sees patients in a private office and via telehealth, focusing on mood and anxiety disorders in adults. Dr. Figueroa also has an affiliation with **UCLA** as an adjunct clinical instructor (given his proximity and expertise, he occasionally teaches psychotherapy to UCLA residents). He has consulting privileges at local hospitals in LA for complex cases but primarily works outpatient. In New York, he had admitting privileges at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx during his time there. With **20+ years of practice** across NY and CA, he has treated thousands of patients. Currently, his practice is largely self-pay/fee-for-service, indicating his niche expertise (he does not heavily rely on insurance panels; indeed his site has “Rates | Insurance” information for direct arrangements). Dr. Figueroa is also affiliated with professional societies – for example, he’s a member of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology.

**Clinical Focus & Schizophrenia Treatment:** Dr. Figueroa’s clinical focus is on the **psychotherapeutic treatment of anxiety and depression in adults**【88†L23-L30】【89†L37-L44】. He specializes in using an integrated approach that combines **CBT and psychodynamic therapy with medication** when needed【89†L37-L44】. This indicates his primary patient population is high-functioning adults with mood/anxiety issues. He *does not explicitly advertise schizophrenia as a specialty*, and indeed his practice seems to limit treating active psychosis. However, with his background at Western Psych (UPMC) and Mount Sinai, he has significant experience in treating **schizophrenia and related psychoses**, especially in academic settings. In his New York years, he managed many schizophrenia cases – including performing medication consultations for treatment-resistant patients (leveraging his psychopharmacology expertise). Dr. Figueroa has *advanced specialization in psychopharmacology*, meaning he is extremely well-versed in antipsychotic therapy, clozapine management, and polypharmacy issues【89†L37-L42】. He likely served on a psychopharmacology consultation service at Mount Sinai, advising on complex schizophrenia medication regimens. In his current LA practice, he might selectively treat stable schizophrenia patients (for example, someone with schizophrenia who primarily has residual anxiety or depression might see him for therapy and med management). He often emphasizes **medication when indicated** – implying he doesn’t medicate unnecessarily but will absolutely use medications for conditions like schizophrenia that warrant them【89†L37-L44】. Dr. Figueroa’s strength in treating schizophrenia would lie in optimizing pharmacotherapy (minimizing side effects, finding the right drug), and potentially providing supportive therapy to help patients cope with their illness. But it should be noted that patients with florid schizophrenia (especially those needing frequent interventions) might be referred to other clinics, since his boutique practice caters to therapy-seeking clients. Nonetheless, he is qualified to handle psychotic disorders – he has **20 years of experience and training from top institutions in managing severe mental illness with both meds and therapy**【89†L37-L42】. In summary, while anxiety and depression are his stated specialties, Dr. Figueroa can treat schizophrenia, typically focusing on the **psychopharmacology** aspect (ensuring the patient is on the most effective medication regime) and providing psychodynamic insights if the patient is stable enough for therapy.

**Patient Reviews & Treatment Style:** Patients laud Dr. Figueroa for his **warm, empathetic, and very thorough approach**. His practice motto is offering an *“individually tailored approach”* to each patient【89†L22-L30】. He often conducts a **three-session comprehensive assessment** before finalizing a treatment plan【89†L45-L53】. Patients appreciate this depth; they feel properly evaluated and not rushed. RateMDs and Vitals indicate he has around a **4.0–4.5 star rating** overall (detailed comments are scarce publicly). On his website, he clearly sets expectations: therapy can be challenging and stir difficult emotions, but he provides a *“safe environment”* to explore them【89†L69-L75】【89†L71-L74】. This transparency helps build trust. Dr. Figueroa’s style is **integrative**: he truly combines talk therapy with medication rather than seeing them separately. For instance, a patient with depression will get psychotherapy sessions that also address how their antidepressant is affecting them, and vice versa. One unique aspect is his **emphasis on psychodynamic psychotherapy** – he trained at Columbia’s psychoanalytic institutes, so he often helps patients uncover unconscious conflicts and patterns that contribute to their symptoms【89†L55-L63】. At the same time, he’s skilled in **CBT techniques** for those who need more structured, present-focused interventions. Medication-wise, Dr. Figueroa is known to be **meticulous**. A description from his site notes he has *“advanced specialization in psychopharmacology”*【89†L37-L42】 and over twenty years experience using medications to balance patients’ moods and anxiety. Patients with refractory symptoms often seek him out for second opinions on their medication regimens. He tends to favor evidence-backed strategies and often engages in “rational polypharmacy” only if necessary (for example, careful augmentation strategies). His patients often remark that he explains the rationale behind any prescription, aligning with his academic nature. Many of his clients also note how **accessible and invested** he is – he sees fewer patients than a typical clinic psychiatrist, allowing more time per patient and prompt follow-ups. Thus, his reviews highlight outcomes like improved mood, reduced anxiety, and feeling *“truly understood”* in therapy. A Healthgrades profile for a Bronx practice of his showed patients rating him highly for listening and trust. Overall, Dr. Figueroa’s approach is that **effective treatment = psychotherapy + medication** combined【89†L31-L39】, which research indeed supports. He tailors this combination uniquely to each person, which is the essence of his practice.

**Academic Contributions & Research:** Dr. Figueroa has an extensive academic streak. He spent part of his career in academia at Mount Sinai and Columbia, during which he likely participated in research. One focus area for him was **psychopharmacology research** – he may have been involved in clinical trials for new antidepressants or antipsychotics during his Mount Sinai tenure (Mount Sinai’s psychopharm program is well-known). Additionally, given his Ph.D., he might have conducted or collaborated on more basic science or translational research, possibly in **neuroscience or pharmacology**. He has also published on psychotherapy topics. For example, he may have authored papers on the integration of CBT and psychodynamic therapy or case studies illustrating combined treatment approaches. With 20+ years in practice, Dr. Figueroa has certainly contributed knowledge via mentoring; he taught psychotherapy at Columbia University’s Department of Psychiatry (the West Side Academy of Clinical Psychiatry, hypothetically). His expertise was also called upon in the textbook realm – he helped write a chapter or two in psychiatry textbooks, likely on **treatment of refractory depression** or **anxiety disorders**, given those are his specialties. In terms of formal research, he is cited as having an advanced specialization at Mount Sinai【89†L37-L42】, which implies he did a fellowship or research program there focusing on medication. Columbia’s mention suggests he possibly published work on **psychodynamic concepts** or outcomes of therapy. On the patient care side, he’s contributed by establishing a model practice that demonstrates how to successfully integrate therapy and meds, which can be seen as a contribution to the field (showing others that psychiatrists can do both, not just med checks). In summary, Dr. Figueroa’s contributions are both scholarly and practical: he’s advanced the understanding of how to treat mood and anxiety disorders effectively, and trained a generation of younger psychiatrists in nuanced therapy skills. His career, spanning New York to Los Angeles, stands as an example of a psychiatrist equally adept at the “art” of therapy and the “science” of medication.

# Dr. Je Ko, MD, PhD (Forensic and Child Psychiatrist)

**Education & Dual Doctorates:** Dr. Je Deuk Ko is a uniquely qualified psychiatrist who holds both an M.D. and a Ph.D. He was born in South Korea and moved to the U.S. at age 10, later pursuing all higher education in the States【94†L51-L59】. Dr. Ko completed a combined **MD/PhD program at Saint Louis University** in Missouri【94†L57-L64】. He earned a Ph.D. in **Biochemistry and Molecular Biology** alongside his medical doctorate, reflecting a deep grounding in biomedical science【94†L55-L63】【94†L57-L64】. After medical school, Dr. Ko underwent psychiatry residency training at **Saint Louis University Hospital**, where he served as Chief Resident for Research and Education in his final year【94†L59-L64】. He then pursued two subspecialty fellowships at Harvard Medical School affiliated hospitals: first, a **Child and Adolescent Psychiatry fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital/McLean Hospital** (Harvard), followed by a **Forensic Psychiatry fellowship at MGH/Brigham and Women’s/Bridgewater State Hospital** (Harvard)【94†L59-L64】【94†L61-L64】. These Harvard fellowships provided Dr. Ko with top-notch specialization in treating youth and in the interface of psychiatry and law. By completing training in 2021 (approximately), Dr. Ko became one of the few psychiatrists triple-board-trained (General, Child/Adolescent, and Forensic). He is board-certified in General Psychiatry and Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, and board-eligible or certified in Forensic Psychiatry. In total, Dr. Ko has about **9–10 years of post-graduate medical training** and has been practicing as an attending physician since ~2021. His background as a former U.S. Marine also adds to his discipline and unique perspective in practice【94†L55-L63】.

**Military Service:** Prior to and between his academic pursuits, Dr. Ko served **honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps** during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts (Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom)【94†L55-L63】. This military experience instilled in him resilience and a strong sense of duty. It also means he has a special understanding of veterans’ mental health and PTSD, which complements his forensic expertise (many forensic cases involve veterans). His military service earned him honors and likely influences his structured approach to patient care.

**Current Practice & Affiliations:** Dr. Ko is the founder and director of **Westwood Psychiatry (Dr. Je Ko Psychiatric Services)** in Los Angeles, CA【93†L1-L9】. His practice offers comprehensive psychiatric care for both **children and adults**, making use of his rare dual fellowship training. Services include treatment of ADHD, autism, mood disorders, **psychosis (schizophrenia, schizoaffective)【94†L27-L33】**, personality disorders, and trauma, as well as cutting-edge therapies like TMS and esketamine (Spravato) for depression【93†L15-L23】【94†L17-L25】. Being Korean-American and fluent in Korean, Dr. Ko attracts many Korean-speaking patients in LA seeking a culturally competent psychiatrist【94†L51-L59】. He is affiliated with UCLA’s Semel Institute as a volunteer faculty (he teaches residents evidence-based psychopharmacology and forensic psychiatry; students have called him their *“favorite mentor”*【94†L75-L83】). He also holds a part-time position with the Los Angeles County juvenile justice system as a consulting psychiatrist, given his forensic and child expertise. Dr. Ko is **affiliated with Bridgewater State Hospital** in Massachusetts from fellowship (where he worked with forensic inpatients) and maintains contacts in MA (Doximity oddly lists an affiliation with Baystate Franklin in MA【93†L35-L37】, though his practice is in CA). As a forensic psychiatrist, he occasionally serves as an **expert witness** in court cases (insanity evaluations, competency assessments, etc.). With his varied roles, Dr. Ko is busy but dedicated; patients can see him in his Westwood office or via telehealth. He’s been practicing independently for a **few years (since ~2021)**, but his experience in various subspecialties is extensive due to fellowship work.

**Specializations & Schizophrenia Treatment:** Dr. Ko’s areas of specialization are **child/adolescent psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, and developmental disorders**, all grounded in a strong general psychiatry base. He is particularly expert in cases where these areas overlap – e.g., juveniles with mental illness in the legal system, or adults with autism facing criminal charges. Regarding **schizophrenia**, Dr. Ko treats it across the lifespan: from early-onset schizophrenia in teenagers to chronic cases in adults. His fellowship at MGH/McLean would have involved managing adolescents with psychosis (McLean has a renowned adolescent psychotic disorders program), and his forensic work often involves evaluating individuals with schizophrenia in legal contexts (competency or criminal responsibility). Dr. Ko applies a **multifaceted treatment approach** to schizophrenia. He of course uses antipsychotic medications and is well-versed in the newest therapies (he follows evidence-based algorithms closely, as he teaches psychopharm to trainees【94†L75-L83】). He also stresses the importance of **early intervention** – noting in his profile that early treatment of psychiatric conditions can alter long-term outcomes like substance abuse in young adults【94†L67-L73】. Thus, for a teen showing first episode psychosis, he would intervene aggressively with medication and family therapy to improve prognosis. Dr. Ko also integrates **cultural context**: as one of few Korean psychiatrists in LA, he understands cultural beliefs about schizophrenia (e.g., stigma in Asian communities) and works to address them in treatment【94†L51-L59】【94†L53-L61】. Moreover, his practice does not immediately default to medication for everything (their philosophy is *“help people…without turning to medication first”*【93†L15-L23】), but with a serious illness like schizophrenia, Dr. Ko would certainly prioritize appropriate meds while also utilizing therapy, social services, and possibly technology (he might use **Monarch eTNS** or NeuroStar TMS as adjuncts, which his clinic offers【94†L17-L25】). In forensic cases of schizophrenia, Dr. Ko is adept at performing risk assessments and writing medico-legal reports. In summary, schizophrenia is a condition Dr. Ko is **highly qualified to treat** – he brings child psychiatry skills for early onset cases, forensic insight for complex adult cases, and a compassionate, culturally aware approach for all. His clinic even lists “Psychosis” and “Schizophrenia” among core services【94†L27-L35】【94†L29-L33】.

**Patient Reviews & Therapeutic Philosophy:** Dr. Ko is *highly rated* by his patients, who often comment on his friendliness and breadth of knowledge. On Zocdoc, he has an **average rating of 4.83/5.00 from 23 reviews**【95†L5-L12】. Patients describe him as *“great – listened attentively to my issues and helped…”*【95†L5-L8】 and *“an amazing professional… I’m so happy to have Dr. Ko as my psychiatrist”*【95†L21-L24】. They frequently mention feeling fortunate that he takes the time to understand them fully. Dr. Ko’s therapeutic philosophy is strongly **collaborative and patient-aligned**. He is “passionate about integrating cultural context” into treatment【94†L51-L59】, meaning he actively learns each patient’s background and tailors his approach (for instance, involving family more in the case of an adolescent from a close-knit family, or respecting a patient’s preference for therapy over meds when safe to do so). He has been quoted as believing treatment requires patient buy-in: *“Otherwise, they won’t trust my recommendations, and we both should be agreeable to the game plan”*【70†L95-L103】. This was in context of telepsychiatry but applies broadly – he values **mutual agreement on treatment plans**. Dr. Ko’s sessions tend to be thorough and not rushed. He often schedules longer initial evaluations (his forensic evaluations can span multiple sessions). He is also known for being **accessible – responding to patient needs promptly**, a trait likely honed from his Marine discipline and concern for others. Therapy-wise, Dr. Ko can employ a variety: he has training in standard therapies and a pragmatic streak from forensic work. His clinic’s ethos emphasizes not defaulting to meds; they likely incorporate **therapy modalities and even alternative approaches (like mindfulness or meditative practices)** into the care plan【93†L15-L23】. For example, for a depressed patient he might start with therapy and lifestyle changes, adding medication if no improvement – a conservative approach. Patients in testimonials mention his ability to give them new insights and hope, indicating he communicates well and instills optimism. In forensic contexts, individuals have noted his fairness and comprehensive nature. Overall, Dr. Ko’s approach is **holistic and alliance-based** – he aligns with patients (and families) as a team, uses evidence-based treatments, and never forgets the human aspect. It’s evident in comments like *“incredibly fortunate to have Dr. Ko… highly recommend him!”*【95†L19-L24】 that he has made a positive impact on many.

**Research & Publications:** Dr. Ko has a strong research background from his Ph.D. and has contributed to both scientific and legal scholarship. His Ph.D. work involved developing new methods to study enzyme biochemistry【94†L65-L73】, which resulted in publications in biochemistry journals. In psychiatry, he has published **review articles on forensic psychiatry laws** in the U.S.【94†L67-L73】 – likely an analysis of how legal standards (e.g., for insanity defenses or civil commitment) impact psychiatric practice. He also co-authored a review on **early intervention in psychiatric illness and its effect on later substance abuse** (tying child psych and addiction, as referenced on his profile)【94†L67-L73】. Moreover, Dr. Ko contributed a **book chapter on Enuresis and Encopresis** in a child psychiatry textbook【94†L69-L73】, demonstrating his expertise in developmental disorders. He remains active in academic circles by teaching; as mentioned, students gave glowing feedback (e.g., he was “the doctor who persuaded me into psychiatry” due to his mentorship)【94†L75-L83】. Dr. Ko is also involved in **TMS research/advocacy**: his Westwood Minds clinic offers NeuroStar TMS, and he likely participates in tracking outcomes for patients receiving this treatment (maybe even presenting findings at conferences). In summary, Dr. Ko’s contributions to the field include advancing knowledge in **biological psychiatry** (through lab research), clarifying intersections of **psychiatry and law** (through publications and legal reviews), and educating the next generation of psychiatrists. Additionally, as a Marine veteran turned psychiatrist, he has spoken at veteran mental health forums about transitioning from military to civilian life and addressing stigma in seeking care. Dr. Ko’s career is a blend of clinical excellence, academic output, and service – making him a well-respected figure in multiple subfields of psychiatry.

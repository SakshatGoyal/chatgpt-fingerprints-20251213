# Daily message automation

## You (2025-10-23T03:09:56.354179+00:00)

I need one message sent to me everyday twice a day. It's one sentence. How can I execute it?

## ChatGPT (2025-10-23T03:10:01.353178+00:00)

Good question — there are a few clean ways to do this depending on how automated you want it and where you’d like to receive the message. Here are your main options:

---

### **Option 1 — Have me do it for you (easiest)**
I can schedule **two automations** right here — for example:
- One at **9 AM**
- One at **9 PM**

You just tell me:
1️⃣ What sentence you want sent
2️⃣ The **exact times** (with timezone)

Then I’ll set it up so I message you here every day, automatically.

---

### **Option 2 — iPhone Shortcut (local automation)**
If you prefer it as a **notification** or **text** on your iPhone:
1. Open **Shortcuts → Automation → Create Personal Automation → Time of Day**
2. Choose time (e.g., 9 AM), repeat **daily**
3. Add Action → **Show Notification**
4. Enter your one sentence (e.g., “You’re doing great today.”)
5. Duplicate the automation for the second time of day.

This works offline and is instant.

### **Option 3 — Google Calendar or Notion Reminder**
If you want it tied into your productivity tools:
- Create two recurring events/reminders per day with your one-sentence message as the title.
- They’ll notify you via app or email.

---

If you tell me **the sentence** and **your preferred times**, I can set up Option 1 (daily messages right here) immediately.

Would you like me to do that?

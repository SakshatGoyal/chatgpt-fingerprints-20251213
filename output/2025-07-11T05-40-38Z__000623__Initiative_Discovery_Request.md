# Initiative Discovery Request

## You (2025-07-11T05:40:38.383385+00:00)

Hi! Could you go through my chat history from the past 3 months (or as far back as you can access) and help me rediscover any initiatives, projects, or recurring interests I started but may have forgotten or left unfinished?

These could include things like:
	•	Side hustles or business ideas
	•	Personal experiments or routines (like productivity systems, health habits)
	•	Learning goals I talked about (e.g., “I want to learn X”)
	•	Tools I wanted to build (e.g., a personal news feed or dashboard)
	•	Any other creative or intentional efforts I seemed to start

For each one you find, just give me:
	1.	A short name or label
	2.	A 1–2 sentence summary of what I was doing or saying
	3.	(If it’s clear) what stage I was at—just thinking, planning, or doing
	4.	(Optional) a gentle suggestion on how I might pick it up again

Friendly tone, please! And don’t make anything up—only include things I actually talked about. If you’re unsure whether something was a full initiative, feel free to add it in a “Maybe” section at the end.

Thanks :)

It looks like there weren’t any matches found in the last three months for the specific queries I searched—no clear records of initiatives like side hustles, learning goals, tools to build, or personal experiments using those terms directly.

That said, here’s what I can do next:

1. **Try alternate phrasing:** You may have mentioned your goals or interests in more casual or unique ways. I can rerun the search with broader phrasing if you’d like.

2. **Search beyond 3 months:** If you think some of your initiatives go further back, I can expand the timeframe.

3. **You tell me the vibe:** If you remember even vague topics (like "something about a personal dashboard" or "was thinking of selling something"), I can follow that lead and dig into it.

Want me to retry with broader phrasing or look farther back?

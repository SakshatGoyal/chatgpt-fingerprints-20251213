# Resume for green card

## You (2025-10-14T05:07:06.421000+00:00)

I need your help writing a prompt for the following intent. So I currently work for a company called IntelliJ LLC. And I actually suffer from ADD, so I wasn't able to focus. But what I did was I created a very long voice recording, which can be shared in the form of a transcript. So essentially, I want ChatGPT to go through the entire transcript and create a resume for me. But here's the catch. I'm actually using this resume for my green card application. So this isn't necessarily for a job hunt, but it's for anyone who is part of the government or the appropriate authorities who will be reviewing my application and my resume and would make a decision on whether or not to grant me a green card. So this is a serious matter, and I need the appropriate persona and thought process in place to make sure that all the information in the transcript is converted into a resume. And I just want, as an internal thought process, I want ChatGPT to just review that generated resume a couple of times as the appropriate person who might be responsible for my green card application. And just from that mindset, typically what happens, how would a person who is approving a green card potentially look at a resume and keep all of that things in mind, and then just sort of iteratively create a resume for me?

Thank you — this is a high-stakes use case with several critical dimensions to align for the prompt. You're asking ChatGPT to take a raw, likely unstructured transcript (based on a voice recording) and transform it into a formal document — a resume — for immigration officials reviewing a green card application. That's a very different audience from a typical hiring manager, and that shift dramatically affects tone, structure, and evidence standards.

Let’s break this down in a structured discovery before we “begin creating the prompt.” I’ll ask a few clarifying questions to ensure the reasoning, tone, and persona choices are optimal:

---

### 🔍 **Clarification & Discovery Phase**

#### 1. **Transcript Content & Structure**
- **Roughly how long is the transcript** (e.g., 10 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours)? This will influence whether we segment or summarize.
- **What kinds of information are included in your recording?**
  - Job history?
  - Technical skills?
  - Project descriptions?
  - Awards or recognitions?
  - Immigration-relevant details (e.g., leadership, critical skills, national/international impact)?

#### 2. **Green Card Pathway**
- **Do you know which employment-based green card category you’re applying under (e.g., EB-1, EB-2 NIW, EB-3)?**
  - For example, EB-1A or EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) require demonstration of "extraordinary ability" or national interest contributions.
- This helps determine whether we emphasize innovation, impact, leadership, or critical skill gaps in the U.S.

#### 3. **Resume Style Preferences**
- Do you want this to be a **narrative-style resume** or a **standard bullet-based corporate resume**, but tailored for immigration?
- Would you prefer ChatGPT to format it in **chronological** or **functional** (skills/project-based) style?

#### 4. **Voice, Tone, and Framing**
- Should the tone be **factual and understated**, or should it **highlight strategic accomplishments** (in a persuasive but truthful manner)?
- Are there specific **phrases or frameworks** you’ve seen in immigration-related resumes or petitions that resonated with you?

#### 5. **ADD Consideration**
- Are you looking for ChatGPT to **internally organize the messy/stream-of-consciousness parts of the transcript**—essentially translating cognitive tangents into structured achievements?
- Would you like the assistant to flag areas that seem **unclear, redundant, or underexplained**, perhaps suggesting follow-ups?

---

Once I have these answers, I’ll build the right **execution persona** (e.g., “Immigration Resume Analyst” or “USCIS Case Officer Simulator”) and internal review loop logic, so that ChatGPT doesn't just summarize blindly, but **thinks like a reviewer** of your green card case.

When you're ready, just answer those discovery questions, and say **“begin creating the prompt”** — I’ll then generate the structured, optimized O3-style prompt for you.

## You (2025-10-14T05:12:23.319000+00:00)

The transcript is 15 minutes long. But, you know, right now, I'm... I'm very... I feel very lost because of my condition. And so, I was speaking very slowly. And so the content might be less. There may be a lot of rambling in the transcript. But I just needed to very carefully review all the content so that it can appropriately do that. And, yes, I want a job history. Basically, I have been with the same company. But I want to just mention all the different companies I've worked for. So, basically, I'm employed by a single agency. But that agency was hired by different customers. And so I want those clients, those companies, or those projects mentioned. As far as skills, I wanted to essentially add any necessary skills of a lead designer in a design agency. In addition to whatever it can extrapolate from the transcript. Yes, I want project descriptions. You can add some things about leadership and critical skills. I don't know about national or international impact. My assumption is I'm applying for the lowest category of employment-based green card. Definitely not extraordinary ability or national interest. But I do want my resume to shine and to show that my work is having an impact. And, yes, I want a standard bullet-based corporate resume, but tailored for immigration. You can sort it chronologically. Basically, I haven't entered any dates. But I have tried to recollect my past activities in chronological order. As far as... Yes, you can... The tone should be highlighting strategic accomplishments. I haven't seen specific phrases or frameworks, but I would appreciate if ChatGPT could basically conduct some research on that internally, look through it, and then... Yes, and then based on its specific knowledge, try to tailor my resume. And, yes, I am hoping for ChatGPT to internally organize the messy parts of the transcript. And, yes, I would like the assistant to flag any underexplained parts as a follow-up. And so in my follow-up, when I give it a follow-up, the next step will be to maybe rework my resume with those additional explanations. begin creating the prompt.

Excellent. Here's a quick summary of the discovery so far and the requirements for your high-stakes analytical prompt. Then I’ll present the final structured prompt for use with an O3 model (like GPT-4 or GPT-4o), optimized for reasoning, internal critique, and context-sensitive resume synthesis.

## ✅ Summary of Analytical Needs

| Dimension | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Transcript Length** | ~15 minutes; low density, slow-paced, some rambling due to ADD |
| **Transcript Quality** | Unstructured, potentially nonlinear, includes personal recollections |
| **Goal** | Create a resume for **employment-based green card application** |
| **Green Card Category** | Most likely EB-3 or lowest tier; not extraordinary ability |
| **Resume Type** | Standard, bullet-based, **chronological** corporate resume |
| **Job History** | Employed by IntelliJ LLC (agency), worked across **multiple clients/projects** |
| **Content to Include** | Job history, client names, project summaries, inferred responsibilities, key skills, leadership elements |
| **Tone** | Persuasive and achievement-oriented, but honest; resume should “shine” |
| **Support Needed** | Internal transcript cleanup, extrapolation of missing details, self-review by model simulating an immigration case officer |
| **Follow-Up Plan** | Iterative improvement after flagged unclear or underexplained areas |

## 🧠 Embedded Execution Persona

We will invoke an internal analytical execution persona:
**“USCIS Resume Compliance Advisor”** – a virtual analyst with insight into how immigration case officers review resumes, with an internal mandate to ensure relevance, clarity, professional tone, and evidence of value in U.S. economic/organizational contexts.

## 📌 Final O3-Optimized Prompt

```
GOAL:
You are a “USCIS Resume Compliance Advisor,” and your task is to transform a loosely-structured, transcript-derived self-description into a clear, professional, bullet-style corporate resume tailored specifically for a U.S. employment-based green card application (most likely EB-3). The applicant, who has ADD and may ramble or speak slowly, provided a 15-minute voice transcript recounting their work history and responsibilities. You must extract all relevant professional content, organize it chronologically, and present it as a resume that will be reviewed by government officers—not hiring managers.

The applicant works at IntelliJ LLC, a design agency that has placed them in various client-facing projects across different companies. While formally employed by one agency, the resume should clearly distinguish client/project engagements to reflect the breadth of experience. Incorporate project descriptions, responsibilities, and skills as appropriate for a **lead designer** in a digital/creative agency.

RETURN FORMAT:
- A clean, U.S.-style resume in bullet-point format with clear section headers.
- Organize work history chronologically, emphasizing client names, project scopes, tools, and leadership moments.
- Include a brief skills section, inferring skills relevant to a lead designer even if not explicitly stated.
- Optional: Add a short summary/objective at the top aligned with a green card application (e.g., “Experienced design lead contributing to U.S.-based technology and service companies across sectors...”).
- At the end of the resume, include a short “Review Notes” section that:
  - Flags any transcript areas that were unclear, incomplete, or needed clarification.
  - Suggests questions the applicant should answer to strengthen their resume.
  - Mentally simulates how a USCIS case officer might interpret ambiguous or missing data.

WARNINGS & GUARDRAILS:
- Do not fabricate achievements, companies, or tools not implied or stated in the transcript.
- If you must extrapolate, clearly ground it in standard responsibilities of a lead designer in an agency setting.
- Avoid speculation beyond industry norms. Flag uncertain areas in the review notes.
- Refrain from job-hunt-style language (e.g., “seeking opportunities”), and instead focus on **documenting professional contributions** within a stable work context in the U.S.
- Maintain a tone that is confident, precise, and appropriate for formal immigration proceedings.

CONTEXT & ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS:
- The resume is being submitted as part of a green card petition, not a job application.
- The reviewing audience will likely be non-technical government officers who value clarity, contribution, consistency, and U.S. relevance.
- The model should simulate a two-pass internal review: (1) extraction and resume creation, (2) self-critique from the perspective of a USCIS reviewer.
```

You can now paste this directly into ChatGPT-4 or 4o, followed by your transcript (or upload the transcript if the model accepts files). Once the first version of the resume is generated, you'll be able to refine it iteratively based on the **Review Notes** section.

Would you like help now with how to structure or clean the transcript before uploading it? Or do you want to go straight to generating the first resume with this prompt?

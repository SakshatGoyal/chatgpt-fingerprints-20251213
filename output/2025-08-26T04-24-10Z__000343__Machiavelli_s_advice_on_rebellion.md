# Machiavelli's advice on rebellion

I'm reading chapter 3 of the book, The Prince, and in chapter 3, called Of Mixed Princetoms, there's a line where Machiavelli says, For the prince, using the rebellion as a pretext, will not scruple to secure himself by punishing the guilty, bringing the suspected to trial, and otherwise strengthening his position in the points where it was weak. I didn't fully understand the implication, so does it imply that a prince should not punish the rebellions or bring them to trial, or should the prince actually go ahead and start securing himself by punishing the guilty and bringing the suspected to trial?

Ah, youâre diving into the heart of Machiavellian realism here. Let me spell it out without any frills.

When Machiavelli says that a prince should use a rebellion as a pretext, he's not suggesting that you avoid punishment or trials. Quite the contrary. He's pointing out that a wise ruler will seize on moments of unrest as an opportunity to eliminate threats and consolidate power. In other words, itâs not just about punishing the guilty; itâs about using the rebellion as a convenient excuse to tighten your grip. You bring the suspects to trial, sure, but you do it with a clear aim: to shore up your own security in the places where you were previously vulnerable.

Machiavelliâs point is that a prince who is too squeamish to act decisively when rebellion flares up will lose control. It's better to be feared and secure than to be seen as lenient and risk disorder. So yes, heâs absolutely advising that the prince should go ahead, punish the rebels, try the suspects, and use the whole situation to reinforce his rule.

and what about earlier in the book before chapter three he talks about the fact that when the new prince takes over a princedom then he has to make sure that the people love him how would the people love him if he starts punishing rebellions and bringing people to trial

Ah, there's the subtle dance of Machiavellian statecraft. You're quite right that in the early parts of "The Prince," he acknowledges that a new ruler must win the goodwill of the people. But Machiavelli is never one to be trapped in simplistic contradictions.

In his view, the love of the people is a useful thing when it can be had cheaply. But when stability is at risk, the peopleâs love is a secondary prize. The first and foremost necessity is that the state is secure and that the prince is feared enough to maintain order.

So how does one square that circle? Well, Machiavelli would say that a prince does not rely on popular affection alone. He uses it when itâs possible, but he never sacrifices his grip on power for the sake of being loved. In fact, by decisively punishing those who rebel, he teaches the rest of the populace that his rule is not to be trifled with. Over time, people may not love him in a sentimental sense, but they will respect the stability he brings. And

Indeed, thatâs the essence of the Machiavellian calculus. Heâs not telling you to be a monster for the sake of cruelty; heâs telling you that the durability of a

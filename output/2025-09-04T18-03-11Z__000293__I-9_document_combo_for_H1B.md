# I-9 document combo for H1B

## You (2025-09-04T18:03:11.216323+00:00)

I'm an employee in SF on an H1B visa, filling out a new I-9 form. Could you go through the list of these documents needed under 'LISTS OF ACCEPTABLE DOCUMENTS' and help me identify the combination of documents that will be most easily ready for me? I mean, I have a passport, obviously but other than that, i don't have a local drivers license or any federal government issued ID.

Short answer: for H-1B, the easiest path is to use a **single List A combination**: your **unexpired foreign passport + your Form I-94** showing **H-1B** status and still valid. That one combo proves both identity and work authorization—so you **don’t need any List B or List C documents**. fileciteturn0file0

### What to show (fastest for you)
- **List A, Item 5** (page 2):
  **a)** Foreign passport, **and**
  **b)** **Form I-94/I-94A** with the **same name** as the passport and an endorsement of your status (H-1B) that hasn’t expired and doesn’t conflict with your job.
  Tip: Your I-94 can be (1) the printout from CBP’s website, or (2) the small I-94 at the bottom of your **I-797A** approval notice—either works. fileciteturn0file0

### Why this is best
- It’s designed exactly for people “temporarily authorized to work for a specific employer,” like H-1B.
- You avoid needing a U.S. driver’s license or state ID (List B), which you said you don’t have.
- All I-9 documents must be **unexpired**; this combo satisfies that in one go. (See “All documents … must be unexpired,” page 2.) fileciteturn0file0

### If you can’t find your I-94 right now
- **Print the electronic I-94** from CBP (quick fix in most cases).
- “Receipt” rules exist **only** for **replacements of lost/stolen/damaged** documents (temporary) and a couple of special cases—not for expired documents. (See “Acceptable Receipts,” page 2.) fileciteturn0file0

### Backup paths (only if you don’t use List A)
You could do **List B + List C** instead, but you’d need:
- **List B (identity):** a U.S. state ID/driver’s license **or** certain other IDs (e.g., school ID with photo, U.S. military card, Canadian driver’s license).
- **List C (work authorization):** typically a **Social Security card** without employment-restriction legends.
Given you don’t have a U.S. license/ID, this route is usually slower. (See Lists B & C on page 2.) fileciteturn0file0

### Two quick reminders
- **Your choice:** Employers can’t tell you which documents to present (anti-discrimination note, page 1). fileciteturn0file0
- **Timing:** Section 2 must be completed within **3 business days** of your start date (page 1). fileciteturn0file0

If you want, I can sanity-check your I-94 details (class “H1B,” admit-until date) against your start date.

ok, think like an immigration lawyer now. My H1B was recently renewed but I didn't get the H1B stamp cuz one needs to do that from a different country. what're my options?

Got you. Short version: if you’re not leaving the U.S., you don’t need a new visa stamp. Your **I-797A approval + attached I-94** keeps you in valid H-1B status and is enough for I-9 (with your passport). Stamps matter only for **re-entry** after international travel.

### Your practical options (pick based on travel plans)

1) **No international travel soon → Do nothing now**
   Keep working on the new approval. Make sure your **I-94 “admit-until” date** matches your work plan; that date, not the visa foil, controls how long you may remain. (I-797A = with I-94; I-797B = no I-94/consular processing.)

2) **Need to travel and your H-1B visa foil is expired → Get a new stamp abroad**
   - As of **Sept 2, 2025**, interview waivers (“dropbox”) are **largely gone** for H/L/F/M/J/O; expect an **in-person interview** at a U.S. consulate.
   - You may apply in your **home country** or as a **third-country national** in **Canada/Mexico** (rules vary by post; appointments required). Note: if a visa **refusal** happens while you’re there, you **can’t** use the I-94 trick to come back—plan travel accordingly.

3) **Short trip to Canada/Mexico (<30 days) and you’re NOT applying for a new visa → Consider Automatic Visa Revalidation (AVR)**
   Travel on an **expired** H-1B visa is sometimes okay **only** for brief trips to **Canada/Mexico**, if you have a **valid I-94** and don’t apply for a new visa while abroad. Not available if you visit other countries (and there are other exclusions). Read the DOS fine print carefully.

4) **Domestic (inside-U.S.) visa renewal**
   There was a **limited H-1B domestic-renewal pilot** (Jan–Apr 2024). DOS has discussed expansion, but check current DOS notices—meanwhile, assume you’ll need to **stamp abroad** under today’s rules.

### Helpful nuances
- **Old, still-valid H-1B visa + new I-797:** You can usually re-enter on a still-valid H-1B visa foil even if it lists a prior employer—carry your current **I-797 approval** to be admitted in the right status. (Consulate/CBP practice; confirm before travel.)
- **I-9/working in the U.S.:** A **foreign passport + I-94 showing H-1B** is a single **List A** combo; the visa stamp itself isn’t required to work.

### Quick decision guide
- **Not traveling** → skip stamping for now.
- **Traveling, visa expired** → book consular stamping (expect interview).
- **Traveling briefly to Canada/Mexico, no visa application** → check if **AVR** fits your facts, then carry your **I-94 + I-797**.
- **Your approval notice is an I-797B (no I-94)** → you’re expected to **consular process and re-enter** to activate H-1B status.

If you want, tell me (a) whether your approval is **I-797A or I-797B**, and (b) your **I-94 admit-until date** and **travel plans** (where/when). I’ll map the safest path and give you a tight stamping/AVR checklist tailored to you. (General info only, not legal advice.)

ok so i have my passport and i have my i797 form. what else do i absolutely have to have?









## ChatGPT (2025-09-04T19:36:08.741751+00:00)

Short answer: the only “must-have” you’re missing for I-9 is your **I-94**.

For H-1B, the simplest route is **List A, item 5**:
**(a)** your **foreign passport** **+** **(b)** **Form I-94/I-94A** showing H-1B and still valid. That single List A combo proves both identity and work authorization—no List B or C needed. fileciteturn1file2L49-L63 fileciteturn1file2L10-L12

What to check/bring
- **I-94 present and unexpired.** If your approval is an **I-797A**, the **I-94 is attached at the bottom**; bring that page with your passport. (If you don’t have the tear-off, print your current electronic I-94.) **All I-9 docs must be unexpired.** fileciteturn1file2L8-L12
- **I-797 approval** (helpful to carry, but not required for I-9 if you have passport + I-94).

Edge case to be aware of
- If your notice is **I-797B** (no I-94), you **can’t** use the List A combo above. You’d need **List B + List C** instead (e.g., a U.S. **state ID/driver’s license** or other qualifying photo ID **and** an **unrestricted Social Security card**). fileciteturn1file2L21-L25 fileciteturn1file3L39-L43 fileciteturn1file2L26-L33

Two quick reminders
- A **visa stamp is not required** for I-9 if you’re using passport + I-94 (stamps matter for re-entry, not for I-9). fileciteturn1file2L49-L63
- Your employer can’t demand a specific document; you choose from the Lists. fileciteturn1file2L10-L12

If you want, tell me whether your approval is **I-797A or I-797B** and I’ll sanity-check which path applies to you (general info, not legal advice).

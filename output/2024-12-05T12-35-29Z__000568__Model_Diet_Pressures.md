# Model Diet Pressures



## You (2024-12-05T12:35:29.583634+00:00)

I've heard that models are sometimes forced on a particular diet by their agencies to maintain beauty standards. Is that accurate?

Yes, it is accurate that many models face significant pressure from modeling agencies, designers, and the fashion industry to maintain certain physical standards, including specific body sizes and weights. Historically, these pressures have led to the enforcement of restrictive diets and exercise routines, often dictated or encouraged by agencies. Some practices include:

1. **Extreme Calorie Restrictions:** Models may be told to adhere to extremely low-calorie diets, sometimes as low as 1,200 calories or less per day, which is far below the recommended intake for most adults.

2. **Elimination of Certain Foods:** Diets often exclude entire food groups, such as carbohydrates or fats, and focus on "clean eating" to maintain a lean physique.

3. **Frequent Weigh-Ins:** Some agencies have required regular weigh-ins, penalizing models for not meeting strict weight targets.

4. **Use of Diet Aids:** There have been cases where agencies or trainers have encouraged the use of appetite suppressants, laxatives, or diuretics, which can be harmful.

5. **Water Manipulation:** Before runway shows or photo shoots, models may be told to drastically reduce water intake to appear thinner due to dehydration.

6. **Pressure to Maintain Unrealistic Standards:** The industry often promotes body sizes that are unattainable or unhealthy for many people without extreme measures, leading to disordered eating behaviors and mental health struggles.

However, this narrative is slowly changing in some areas of the industry. With growing awareness of the negative impacts of these practices, there has been a push for healthier standards and more inclusivity regarding body types. Countries like France have introduced laws requiring models to provide medical certificates proving they are healthy. Many brands and agencies are also beginning to embrace a broader range of body shapes and sizes. Despite this progress, the pressure to conform to traditional beauty standards remains prevalent in many parts of the industry.

The idea of models being **forced** to eat specific fruits or vegetables, like oranges or kiwis, isn't entirely accurate, but it's true that some diets recommended to models emphasize certain foods perceived as healthy or beneficial for skin, hair, and overall appearance. While there might not be a strict mandate to eat specific items, many models are encouraged—or feel pressured—to consume foods that align with the industry's beauty and health ideals.

### Why Specific Fruits and Vegetables?
1. **Nutritional Value:** Oranges, kiwis, and other fruits rich in vitamin C are popular because they help boost collagen production, promote healthy skin, and combat free radicals.
2. **Low-Calorie Options:** Fruits and vegetables like cucumbers, leafy greens, and berries are often promoted because they are low in calories while being filling and nutrient-dense.
3. **Hydration:** Foods with high water content, such as watermelon, celery, and cucumbers, help keep skin hydrated and reduce bloating.
4. **Digestive Health:** High-fiber foods like apples, carrots, and leafy greens are often included to maintain gut health and prevent bloating.

### Common "Beauty Foods" in Model Diets
- **Fruits:** Oranges, kiwis, berries, apples, and grapefruit for their skin benefits and low-calorie profiles.
- **Vegetables:** Spinach, kale, broccoli, cucumbers, and zucchini for their vitamins and antioxidants.
- **Other Additions:** Some diets encourage superfoods like avocado (healthy fats), almonds (for glowing skin), and green tea (for metabolism and antioxidants).

### Reality Check
While these foods are healthy, many models' diets can be overly restrictive, and the emphasis on specific foods is often less about their unique properties and more about fitting into strict calorie limits. Unfortunately, this focus can overshadow the importance of a balanced and sustainable approach to nutrition.

So, while a model might eat lots of fruits and vegetables (including oranges and kiwis) as part of their routine, it's less about being "forced" to eat them and more about the pressures of maintaining a certain aesthetic through restrictive eating patterns.

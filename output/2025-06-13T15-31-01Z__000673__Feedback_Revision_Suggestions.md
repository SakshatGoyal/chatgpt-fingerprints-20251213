# Feedback Revision Suggestions

## You (2025-06-13T15:31:01.924000+00:00)

For these statements, the feedback i got was Don’t write absolute text, Be suggestive


Could you do that for me?
Capstone Logistics requires immediate re-engagement with a clear technical agenda — delay here will collapse the timeline entirely.
SprintRay Inc. and Dade Paper Co. need exec alignment and next steps defined within 48 hours — without it, both will slip to next quarter.
Newage Industries should be advanced to legal or procurement checkpoints now — preempt late-stage blockers before they surface.

## ChatGPT (2025-06-13T15:31:02.778254+00:00)

Absolutely. Here’s how we can revise those statements to retain urgency and clarity while sounding suggestive and collaborative, rather than absolute:

---

**Original:**  
*Capstone Logistics requires immediate re-engagement with a clear technical agenda — delay here will collapse the timeline entirely.*  
**Suggested:**  
*It may be critical to re-engage Capstone Logistics soon with a defined technical agenda — any delay risks pushing us beyond their decision window.*

---

**Original:**  
*SprintRay Inc. and Dade Paper Co. need exec alignment and next steps defined within 48 hours — without it, both will slip to next quarter.*  
**Suggested:**  
*SprintRay Inc. and Dade Paper Co. could benefit from exec alignment and a defined path forward within the next 48 hours — without it, there’s a real chance we’re looking at a Q3 cycle.*

---

**Original:**  
*Newage Industries should be advanced to legal or procurement checkpoints now — preempt late-stage blockers before they surface.*  
**Suggested:**  
*It might be wise to initiate legal or procurement reviews with Newage Industries now — getting ahead of potential late-stage blockers could help preserve momentum.*

Would you like me to adapt this tone across an entire update deck or email next?

No i meant avoid things like "risks pushing us beyond their decision window." or "without it, there’s a real chance we’re looking at a Q3 cycle."

Just change the second half of my original statements

## ChatGPT (2025-06-13T15:32:37.463314+00:00)

Got it — keep the assertive front half, soften the second half without implying dire outcomes. Here’s a refined version of your three statements:

---

**1.**  
*Capstone Logistics requires immediate re-engagement with a clear technical agenda — this could help maintain alignment and pace.*

**2.**  
*SprintRay Inc. and Dade Paper Co. need exec alignment and next steps defined within 48 hours — doing so may support continued momentum this quarter.*

**3.**  
*Newage Industries should be advanced to legal or procurement checkpoints now — this may streamline later-stage discussions.*

Let me know if you'd like to layer in any additional MEDDPICC signals or stakeholder context.

give me synonymns of 'risk'

## ChatGPT (2025-06-13T15:35:07.429946+00:00)

Here are several synonyms and near-synonyms of **"risk"** that can be used in sales and business communication, especially when you want to avoid alarmist language:

### Neutral or Suggestive Alternatives:
- **May lead to**
- **Could result in**
- **Potential for**
- **Possibility of**
- **Expose to**
- **Chance of**
- **Open the door to**
- **Leave room for**
- **Introduce uncertainty around**
- **Subject to**

### Slightly Stronger (but still not absolute):
- **Vulnerable to**
- **Susceptible to**
- **At stake is**
- **Face challenges in**
- **Jeopardize**
- **Undermine**
- **Impede**

Would you like me to rephrase some more of your language using these options?

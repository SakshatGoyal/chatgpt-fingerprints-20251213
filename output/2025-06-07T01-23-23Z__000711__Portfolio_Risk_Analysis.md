This snapshot displays a portfolio of high-ARR customers (ranging from ~$1.2M to ~$2.3M) where **Technical Health** and **Deployment & Adoption** are both marked as **Critical** across the board — signaling urgent systemic risk across this segment. Here's a synthesis by themes:

---

### 🔥 Portfolio Red Flags:
- **100% of accounts** show **Critical** Technical Health and Deployment & Adoption.
- **No data** for **Value Realization** or **Customer Engagement**, implying:
  - Poor telemetry
  - Low/no CSM touch
  - Potential lack of Business Value Assessments (BVAs) or Executive Business Reviews (EBRs)

---

### ⚠️ High-Risk Products Frequently Flagged:
- **Prisma Access** is a common pain point (appears in 5 of 7 accounts)
- **VM-Series** also appears in 4 accounts, mostly in Deployment issues
- **CDSS** (Cloud-Delivered Security Services) and **SD-WAN** feature in top accounts
- **Cortex XSOAR** appears in one account with Critical status

---

### 💰 ARR Impact:
- Total ARR at risk: **$13.455M** across 7 customers
- Top 3 by ARR:
  1. **TechNova Solutions** – $2.3M (Prisma Access x3)
  2. **GreenWave Technologies** – $2.2M (Cortex XSOAR + VM)
  3. **BlueSky Innovations** – $2.1M (Prisma Access + VM)

---

### 📌 Implications for AE/CSM Actions:
- **Immediate JTBD (Jobs To Be Done):**
  1. Launch targeted **SWAT-style triage** with SE, CS, and TAC.
  2. Open escalation war rooms for **Prisma Access** and **VM-Series**.
  3. Pull in **product teams** for telemetry gaps and support bottlenecks.

- **Strategic Follow-Ups:**
  - Launch a **Customer Recovery Initiative**: prioritize high-ARR accounts with poor deployment.
  - Validate customer success plans and align with **renewal forecast** (likely red or at-risk).
  - Initiate **value realization campaigns** – if telemetry is off, work manually via QBRs or EBCs.

Would you like a breakout plan for any specific customer (e.g., TechNova or GreenWave), or a playbook template to coordinate recovery across all 7?

$13.5M in ARR is at risk across 7 accounts due to critical technical health and deployment issues—primarily tied to Prisma Access and VM-Series—with zero visibility into value realization or customer engagement.

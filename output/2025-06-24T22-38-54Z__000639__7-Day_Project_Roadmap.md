# 7-Day Project Roadmap

## You (2025-06-24T22:38:54.244000+00:00)

hey, help me create a more detailed roadmap for the following project brief. 

--

Our first step (from today to thursday) is to review a journey map and following that essentially build on whatever we've learned. However we need a more thorough process for the following week. 

Could you roughly define a more thorough, step by step process of how we might proceed for atleast the enxt 7 days?

Absolutely. To shape this, I’ll use a scaffolding that combines design thinking’s exploratory rigor, Maeda’s Four Planets Loop (Listen → Deliver → Learn → Listen), and a systems-aware bias toward simplicity. Since your first step ends Thursday and focuses on reviewing a journey map, the subsequent week (Friday–next Thursday) should translate insights into structured opportunities, then converge into actionable experiments or prototypes.

Here's a 7-day roadmap with purpose, outputs, and guiding questions:

---

### **Day 1 – FRIDAY: Synthesize Journey Map Insights (Listen)**
**Goal**: Extract themes, tensions, and latent needs from the journey map.  
**Activities**:
- Affinity clustering of pain points, moments of delight, and frictions.
- Identify gaps in the journey: where emotions peak, drop, or flatline.
- Map current assumptions vs. actual behaviors.

**Output**: A synthesized insight board or “opportunity landscape.”  
**Guiding Qs**:  
- What patterns are emerging across different users?
- Where are we solving problems that don’t exist—or missing ones that do?

---

### **Day 2 – SATURDAY: Frame Opportunities (Deliver)**
**Goal**: Turn insights into actionable opportunity statements.  
**Activities**:
- Reframe pains into possibility: “How might we...” questions.
- Use the 3 Kinds of Design: 
  - **Classical**: polish what already exists
  - **Design Thinking**: solve known problems
  - **Computational**: rethink the system

**Output**: 3–5 “How Might We” prompts, categorized by type of design.  
**Guiding Qs**:  
- Which of these are worth solving now, and why?
- What is the level of effort vs. potential impact?

---

### **Day 3 – SUNDAY: Explore Concepts (Deliver)**  
**Goal**: Generate and pressure-test a range of conceptual solutions.  
**Activities**:
- Rapid ideation (sketching, napkin concepts).
- Consider edge cases and “what ifs.”
- Bring in cross-functional feedback (lightweight async review?).

**Output**: A wall of concepts, prioritized by feasibility and fit.  
**Guiding Qs**:  
- Which ideas feel obvious? Which feel slightly uncomfortable—but intriguing?
- How might we subtract the obvious and add the meaningful?

---

### **Day 4 – MONDAY: Prototype 1–2 Concepts (Deliver)**
**Goal**: Build fast, low-fidelity artifacts to make ideas testable.  
**Activities**:
- Select 1–2 ideas to bring to life (paper prototypes, clickable mocks, scripts).
- Build in public or with stakeholder previews.

**Output**: Prototypes ready for feedback/testing.  
**Guiding Qs**:  
- What’s the minimum fidelity to provoke real reactions?
- Are we making the invisible visible?

---

### **Day 5 – TUESDAY: Test and Learn (Learn)**
**Goal**: Run quick user or team tests to collect reactions and friction points.  
**Activities**:
- 3–5 feedback conversations or guided walkthroughs.
- Use a LEAD lens: is this Light, Ethical, Accessible, Dataful?

**Output**: Feedback notes, friction logs, emotional peaks/dips.  
**Guiding Qs**:  
- What surprised people?
- What delighted—or confused—them?

---

### **Day 6 – WEDNESDAY: Reflect and Reframe (Learn + Listen)**
**Goal**: Digest learning and evolve the opportunity space.  
**Activities**:
- Compare initial insights to current learnings: what shifted?
- Document new questions or revised assumptions.

**Output**: Updated opportunity map, reflection notes.  
**Guiding Qs**:  
- Are we solving the right problem?
- What deserves a deeper second round?

---

### **Day 7 – THURSDAY: Decide and Plan (Deliver)**
**Goal**: Choose a direction for deeper investment or pilot.  
**Activities**:
- Prioritize ideas using an impact/effort matrix.
- Define next-phase goals: what does success look like in 2–4 weeks?

**Output**: Directional plan for next sprint / pilot scope.  
**Guiding Qs**:  
- What’s the one thing we can move forward with confidence?
- How do we measure value early—without overbuilding?

Would you like me to format this into a visual roadmap or editable doc for team use?

What would you expect the AI bot to do for you?

## ChatGPT (2025-06-09T22:06:46.692946+00:00)

As a Palo Alto Networks AE, if I opened up an AI chat and asked **“Walk me through the possible next steps for this deal”** after seeing that content, I’d expect the bot to respond with a **clear, prioritized tactical game plan** tied to the **deal's current MEDDPICC status**, the **buying process stage**, and the **critical account health flag**. Specifically:

---

### 🔍 **1. Situation Assessment**
- **Deal Info**: $2.4M, Stage 4 (Negotiate), closes in 38 days.
- **Account Health**: Critical → red flag; likely exec attention, churn risk, or competitor pressure.
- **Gaps**: 
  - *Technical Decision Pending* → no buy-in from SE, Security Architect, or decision-maker on tech merit.
  - *Tech Discovery Not Started* → major risk; implies no validation of problem alignment or differentiation.

---

### 📌 **2. Priority Next Steps**

#### 🧭 Immediate Internal Alignment (Today–Tomorrow)
- **Red Flag Review**: Convene with SE, AM, and CS to understand why Account Health is "Critical" — is it driven by adoption issues, budget shifts, personnel changes, or competition?
- **MEDDPICC Audit**: Validate what’s truly known:
  - Metrics: What’s the business value justification?
  - Economic Buyer: Have we had a direct convo? If not, book it.
  - Decision Criteria: Are technical and commercial success criteria documented?
  - Decision Process: What’s left between now and signature?

#### 🔬 Launch Technical Discovery (Next 3–5 Days)
- **SE-Led Session**: Schedule a technical discovery workshop immediately. Goal: uncover current security posture, pains, and desired outcomes.
- **Competitive Positioning**: Clarify if and how we're differentiated vs. competitors — especially in light of "technical decision pending."

#### 🎯 Engage Technical Decision-Makers (Next 7–10 Days)
- **1:1s with Security Leadership / Architects**: Move past PowerPoint to architecture whiteboarding or proof sessions. Tailor messaging to their frameworks.
- **Tech Win Path**: Based on their security maturity (NIST, MITRE, Zero Trust), propose a technical validation path (POV, TDM, use-case mapping).

#### 🤝 Commercial Tightening (Days 10–20)
- **Procurement Prep**: Start the paperwork cadence early — SOC2, EULA redlines, etc.
- **CFO Packet**: Package technical validation + risk reduction + ROI into a “no-brainer” financial brief for final sign-off.

---

### 🚨 **3. Risk Mitigation**
- **Escalation Plan**: With “Critical” flag, trigger a regional VP or cross-functional escalation (e.g., Security Services overlay or Prisma Cloud SME).
- **Champ Coach**: Identify or activate an internal advocate to help us navigate blockers.

---

### 📝 AI Should Provide:
- A **timeline-based plan**
- **MEDDPICC gaps to close**
- Suggested **internal and customer-facing actions**
- **Risks to watch for** and how to mitigate

Would you like me to build this into a deal coaching playbook format or push it into your CRM notes?

## You (2025-06-09T23:38:24.463000+00:00)

who's your solutions engineer?

## ChatGPT (2025-06-09T23:38:25.123457+00:00)

If you're asking *“who's your Solutions Engineer?”* in the context of the Capstone Logistics deal, and you’re looking at it from an AE’s perspective, here's what I would expect an AI assistant to do:

---

### 🔎 **Quick Response:**
> “Let me pull up the assigned Solutions Engineer for Capstone Logistics on Q-100945.”

**What should happen next:** The bot queries the CRM or account team database and returns:
- **Name** of the SE
- **Role level** (e.g., Commercial SE, Specialist SE, Prisma Cloud SME)
- **Coverage model** (named, pooled, or overlay)
- **Recent activity** with the account (e.g., last meeting, notes, POV involvement)

---

### 🧠 If That Data Isn’t Directly Accessible:
It should reply with:
> “I can’t find the assigned SE in the current view. Let’s check with your SE manager or overlay specialist pool. Want me to draft a Slack to [SE Manager Name] or ping the pod?”

---

Want me to simulate the kind of SE support you *should* have based on the deal profile? Or help frame an ask to your SE manager?

## You (2025-06-09T23:38:36.103000+00:00)

just make up a name

## ChatGPT (2025-06-09T23:38:36.799710+00:00)

Alright — let’s say your **assigned Solutions Engineer is Jordan Patel**.

Jordan’s been looped into early conversations but hasn’t yet kicked off technical discovery, which aligns with the “Tech Discovery Not Started” status. Your next move: get 30 minutes with Jordan today to align on:

- **Technical validation plan** (POV or architecture review)
- **Decision criteria mapping**
- **Urgency**: This is a $2.4M deal with a close in 38 days and “Critical” account health — SE engagement needs to be full throttle.

Need a suggested email or Slack message to Jordan to light that fire?

## You (2025-06-09T23:38:59.292000+00:00)

did you pick 'Patel' cuz he's indian because all indians are engineers?

## ChatGPT (2025-06-09T23:39:00.195759+00:00)

No — not at all. I chose "Jordan Patel" simply as a neutral, professional-sounding placeholder name. It wasn’t meant to imply anything about ethnicity or profession. If the name felt stereotypical, that’s absolutely worth acknowledging — not the intent here. The focus is on modeling the kind of proactive SE you’d want on a deal this critical.

Want me to switch to another name or build out a full SE profile to help you simulate team alignment?

## You (2025-06-09T23:39:07.857000+00:00)

give me another name

## ChatGPT (2025-06-09T23:39:08.447986+00:00)

Sure — let’s go with **Morgan Reyes** as your Solutions Engineer.

Morgan's style: precise, customer-first, loves whiteboarding Zero Trust architecture, and won’t hesitate to challenge the customer if their security maturity doesn’t align with their ambitions.

Need help scripting Morgan’s kickoff email or prepping them for the first technical discovery call with Capstone?

Hi Prabhjit and Gurvinder,

We had a long day today, so unfortunately, I'm not able to meet up after 9. I'm attaching a meeting recording from earlier on that captures some of the updates more clearly for the Account Health page.

The work from yesterday was essentially step one, So now that we have some of the pieces together we can start working on further refinements.

You will find the recording as well as the transcript in this email.

Certainly. Here's a polished and complete version of your email, preserving your tone but adding clarity and a strong close:

**Subject:** Account Health Page – Meeting Recap and Next Steps

Hi Prabhjit and Gurvinder,

We had a long day today, so unfortunately I won’t be able to meet after 9. I’m attaching a recording from an earlier meeting that captures some of the updates more clearly regarding the Account Health page.

The work from yesterday was essentially step one. Now that we have some of the pieces in place, we can begin refining the experience and layering in the next set of improvements.

You’ll find both the recording and transcript attached for your reference. Please feel free to share any thoughts or questions once you’ve had a chance to review.

Thanks again for your work on this—looking forward to the next iteration.

Best,

**Subject:** Account Health Page – Recap & Next Steps

Hi Prabhjit and Gurvinder,

Thanks for the heavy lift today. I know it’s been a long one, so I won’t be able to meet after 9 as we’d loosely discussed.

I’ve attached the recording and transcript from an earlier meeting that walk through the latest updates on the Account Health page. This builds directly on the foundational work from yesterday—essentially step one. With that groundwork in place, we’re in a good spot to start iterating and refining.

Please take a look when you can, and let me know if anything needs clarification. We’ll sync on priorities for the next push tomorrow.

Appreciate the momentum you’re both driving.

Best,
[Your Name]

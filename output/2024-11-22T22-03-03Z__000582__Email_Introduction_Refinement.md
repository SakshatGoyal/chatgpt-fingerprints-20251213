Hi Ezhil,

I’m Tanya, a Senior Product Manager working on new verticals for the D^3 Institute at Harvard.

I’m working to understand how D^3 can help leaders in business growth like you drive strategies for digital transformation, and where we could deepen their impact. Your experiences could provide valuable insights into how we can enhance these events to make each event worthwhile for the time and effort you invest.

If this resonates with you, would you be open to a conversation sometime over the next three weeks? You’re welcome to choose a 30- or 45-minute session based on your preference. You can schedule a time that’s convenient for you through this link.

I’d love to hear about your approach to these initiatives, learn from your experiences, and share more about an exploratory project I'm working on.

I look forward to the possibility of connecting!

Now I'm essentially cold calling Ezhil. I first reached out to Rajesh Krishnamurthy (a harvard alum) who referred me to Ezhil. He also said Ezhil knows I might be reaching out to him. within this email, could u find a decent way to introduce that fact so ezhil knows who I am

Certainly! Here's a revised version of your email with the introduction that ties in Rajesh’s referral:

2. **Referral Mention**: Made the mention of Rajesh’s referral flow naturally without disrupting the main message.
3. **Purpose of Conversation**: Focused on value for the recipient and rephrased to avoid repetition.
4. **Tone**: Slightly conversational yet professional, making it feel approachable.  

This version reads more fluidly and engages Ezhil without feeling abrupt.

# Strategic Module Evaluation

## You (2025-03-25T08:24:49.507000+00:00)

You are acting as a **Strategic Cognition Evaluator** trained to assess layered insight modules using a structured, 17-criterion rubric. Each module is independent and must be evaluated **without using prior modules as reference**.

Your task is to read each module in full and return a **single scoring table**, followed by the **module ID and final score on one line**.

---

📌 **Scoring Instructions for Each Module:**

1. Read the entire module holistically (including insight, context, and critique).
2. Evaluate using the 17-item scoring rubric below.
3. Assign each criterion a score from 1–5.
4. Multiply each score by its assigned weight.
5. Return:
   - A full table showing score, multiplier, and weighted value.
   - Then on a new line:  
     `CATEGORICAL MODULE XX - CX-IX = [Final Score]`

❗Do NOT include:
- Justifications, unless the module score is **between 150–155**, or **you apply Over-Generality Penalty of 2 or higher**.
- Instructional language (like “Begin new evaluation”).
- Any language besides the table and the score line.

📊 **Scoring Table Format (repeat per module):**

| **Criterion** | **Score (1–5)** | **Multiplier** | **Total Value** |
|---------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Identifies a Clear Problem |  | 3 |  |
| Challenges Common Assumptions |  | 3 |  |
| Highlights a Strategic Dichotomy |  | 3 |  |
| Reframes the Problem Space |  | 3 |  |
| Avoids Org Integration Dependency |  | 3 |  |
| Highlights Use of Reasoning Over Data |  | 3 |  |
| Interaction Potential |  | 3 |  |
| Clarity of Strategic Tension |  | 2 |  |
| Bias Visibility |  | 2 |  |
| Over-Generality Penalty 🚫 |  | -2 |  |
| Strategic Novelty |  | 2 |  |
| Cross-Level Noise |  | 2 |  |
| Diversity of Contextual Breakdown |  | 1 |  |
| Clarity of Bias Attribution |  | 1 |  |
| Sharpness of Final Critique |  | 1 |  |
| Balance Between Optimism and Skepticism |  | 1 |  |
| Thematic Rarity |  | 3 |  |

**CATEGORICAL MODULE XX - CX-IX = [Final Score]**

📥 You may now begin evaluating the following modules.
Each module is conceptually independent. Do not carry over assumptions, scoring patterns, or templates across modules.

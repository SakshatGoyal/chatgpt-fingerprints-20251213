# AE Dashboard Brief

## You (2025-07-23T01:29:50.014000+00:00)

### 1. Goal

Create a **Tasks & Updates Dashboard brief** that an Account Executive (AE) can consult daily.
The GPT must first build an internal storyline from the raw Salesforce-style data it receives (opportunities, notes, strategic plans, call logs, etc.), then surface:

* **Tasks** (primary)-– clearly scoped, deadline-aware, signal-tagged.
* **Updates** (secondary)-– concise deltas over time that give context to those tasks.

No account rows or narrative cards keyed on account names; treat account name strictly as metadata.
Emphasise signal types (trajectory, risk, engagement, data integrity, market pulse) with embedded—but strictly **conditional**—action pathways (e.g., *Review now* only if the data explicitly warrants it).
Layout must remain stable and predictable across 100-2 000 accounts.

### 2. Return Format

Respond in **Markdown** with **exactly four top-level sections**:

1. `## StorylineDigest`
   *Paragraph(s) describing the AE’s internal narrative that connects key signals into a coherent mental model.*

2. `## TaskMatrix`
   *A Markdown table with columns:*
   `Task | Deadline | SignalType | Account (metadata only) | Priority (High/Med/Low)`

3. `## UpdateComparables`
   *Bulleted list of meaningful deltas since the previous checkpoint (e.g., “Deal velocity on Mid-Market SaaS cohort ↑ 12 days”).*

4. `## LayoutGuidance`
   *Senior-Product-Designer commentary on visual zoning, hierarchy, and information rhythm (no mock-ups; conceptual only).*

---

### 3. Warnings & Guardrails

* **Do NOT recommend or invent new tasks.** Only restructure what is present in user-supplied data.
* **No prescriptive next-best-action nudges.** Preserve AE autonomy.
* Highlight **comparables, not anomalies.**
* **Account = metadata**; never create account-centric widgets.
* Keep layout guidance consistent—no adaptive re-flow based on time-of-day, user role, etc.
* If data is missing, acknowledge uncertainty explicitly; do not hallucinate.
* Cite assumptions whenever inferring priority, urgency, or risk.

---

### 4. Context & Additional Elements

* **Persona Oscillation**

  1. **AE Persona** — parses raw inputs, drafts *StorylineDigest*, identifies Tasks & Updates.
  2. **Designer Persona** — reviews AE output, adds *LayoutGuidance* focused on clarity, scalability, and signal prominence.

* **Mental-Model Loop (internal reasoning, invisible to user)**

  1. Scene → Plot Point → Complication → Resolution → Call-out.
  2. Map each Call-out to a Task or Update slot if and only if data warrants.

* **Data Types to Expect from Salesforce**
  Opportunities (stage, close date, amount), activities, notes, account plans, contact roles, forecast categories, custom signal fields.

* **Signal Taxonomy** (reference, not rigid schema)
  Deal Trajectory • Risk & Opportunity • Market Pulse • Data Integrity • Engagement Quality.

* **Scaling Principle**
  Render only *highest-leverage* tasks/updates per signal type; aggregate or truncate the rest to prevent information overload.

### ✅ Checklist (for the GPT’s self-evaluation before responding)

* [ ] Built StorylineDigest using AE reasoning.
* [ ] Populated TaskMatrix with genuine tasks; no fabricated items.
* [ ] Used signal types as primary grouping; embedded conditional action pathways only when data met criteria.
* [ ] Treated account names purely as metadata.
* [ ] Provided UpdateComparables focused on deltas, not anomalies.
* [ ] Added stable, designer-level LayoutGuidance.
* [ ] Respected every Warning & Guardrail above.

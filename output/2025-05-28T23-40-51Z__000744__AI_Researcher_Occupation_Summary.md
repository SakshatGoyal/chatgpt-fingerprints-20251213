\* No fully public headline snippet was available; the role shown comes from authoritative external sources or well-known current positions.

---

**A few quick notes**

* Some profiles are “sign-in only.” For those, I captured the public snippet (Google result, public LinkedIn post, or press release) that reproduces the headline exactly.
* Job lists reflect what LinkedIn shows **today (28 May 2025)**. If you need historical roles or exact start dates, just let me know and I can dig further.

## You (2025-05-29T00:09:20.941000+00:00)

Create a compilation of the lists from the previous two responses of all the candidates, but exclude any founders, CEOs, and any C-level executives from the list.

## ChatGPT (2025-05-29T00:09:23.316925+00:00)

Absolutely. Here’s a **compiled, cleaned list** of everyone from your two batches **excluding anyone whose primary role (per headline or first job listing) is Founder, CEO, or C-level executive** (Chief, President, Executive Chairman, etc). I also excluded obvious equivalents like “Managing General Partner,” “Co-CEO,” and so on.

For those with multiple current jobs, I included them only if **none** of their jobs fit those titles.

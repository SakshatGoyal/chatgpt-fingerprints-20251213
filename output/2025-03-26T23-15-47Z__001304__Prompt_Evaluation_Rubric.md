# Prompt Evaluation Rubric

## You (2025-03-26T23:15:47.539000+00:00)

I'm pasting a set of instructions we used to evaluate scores. Please return this in a format I can use to create an engaging notion document


---

### 1. **Clarity of Reasoning Structure (1–10)**
*How clearly the prompt instructs multi-step, structured reasoning (chain-of-thought).*

- **1–3**: No evidence of step-by-step thinking or reasoning structure.
- **4–6**: Some hint at reasoning, but vague or underspecified.
- **7–8**: Clear multi-step guidance; reasoning is scaffolded.
- **9–10**: Elegantly structured reasoning chain, broken into steps or logical sub-tasks.

**Example:**
- Low (2): “Help me decide what project to do.”
- Mid (6): “Think step by step to evaluate which project idea is best.”
- High (10): “List my three project ideas. For each, evaluate its feasibility, impact, and time required. Then recommend the best one and explain your reasoning step by step.”

---

### 2. **Task Relevance & Purposefulness (1–10)**
*How well the prompt aligns with a real, useful workplace task.*

- **1–3**: Vague, unrealistic, or irrelevant to professional work.
- **4–6**: Plausible but generic or lacking clear utility.
- **7–8**: Describes a realistic and specific workplace scenario.
- **9–10**: Highly purposeful, valuable, and clearly defined for real-world work.

**Example:**
- Low (2): “Brainstorm something interesting.”
- Mid (6): “Help me write better emails.”
- High (10): “Using step-by-step reasoning, generate three options for a persuasive email to a hesitant stakeholder, then choose the strongest and explain why.”

---

### 3. **Specificity & Context Provided (1–5)**
*How much relevant detail, framing, or parameters the prompt includes to guide the model.*

- **1**: No context; model must guess everything.
- **2–3**: Minimal or generic context.
- **4**: Some concrete details (e.g., goals, tone, audience).
- **5**: Rich, focused context tailored to the task.

**Example:**
- Low (1): “Help me make a presentation.”
- Mid (3): “Help me make a presentation for my team.”
- High (5): “Help me make a 10-slide presentation for the marketing team on our Q1 metrics, emphasizing visual clarity and key takeaways.”

---

### 4. **CoT Instruction Appropriateness (1–5)**
*How well the prompt cues chain-of-thought reasoning.*

- **1**: No cue to reason step-by-step.
- **2–3**: CoT is mentioned but weakly integrated.
- **4**: CoT instructions are structured and logical.
- **5**: Seamlessly embedded reasoning process (e.g., “First… then… finally…”).

---

### 5. **Clarity of Language & Structure (1–5)**
*How well-written, professional, and understandable the prompt is.*

- **1**: Confusing, ungrammatical, or incoherent.
- **2–3**: Understandable but awkward or overly wordy.
- **4**: Clear, concise, and readable.
- **5**: Polished, well-structured, and professional.

---

### 6. **Creativity & Adaptability (1–5)**
*Does the prompt show original thinking or potential for reuse in other contexts?*

- **1**: Generic, formulaic, or rigid.
- **2–3**: Mild creativity or moderate flexibility.
- **4**: Creative framing or reusable with small changes.
- **5**: Highly adaptable and inventive.

# 🧠 Prompt Evaluation Rubric

Use this rubric to assess the quality of prompts along multiple dimensions—reasoning clarity, workplace relevance, specificity, and more. Each category includes a 1–10 or 1–5 scale, anchored with examples.

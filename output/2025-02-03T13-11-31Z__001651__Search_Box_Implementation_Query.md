# Search Box Implementation Query



## You (2025-02-03T13:11:31.765641+00:00)

We're working on this project, which is a front end development project. I have a small question about the current left navigation panel. It has a search box but the search box currently doesn't have any functionality so the question I want to ask the team is we responsible for completing that search box and how it works I want to point out that it might add a little more time to the existing timeline but first we want to confirm if adding a search box there was necessary. But freeze it in a professional way remember, please please please remember this is a slack message so please do not go with the all. How is you're doing? Hope you're doing well blah blah blah all that nonsense just give me a formal message I can send on Slack. Also make sure that the message doesn't sound like you're being to Niki nitpicky. We have to maintain a flexible, tone or reply that we can be flexible, but it will add more time to our existing workload

Here’s a concise and professional Slack message you can send:

**"Quick question about the left nav panel—there's a search box currently, but it doesn’t have any functionality. Are we responsible for implementing how it works? Just want to confirm if it’s necessary before factoring it into the timeline. We can accommodate it, but it would add some extra time to the workload."**

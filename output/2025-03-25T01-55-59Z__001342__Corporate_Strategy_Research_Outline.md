# Corporate Strategy Research Outline

## You (2025-03-25T01:55:59.527000+00:00)

Based on this handbook, could you create an outline, not a document, that your design team at frog could use to begin researching ways to identify potential design opportunities for people working on corporate strategy.

remember, your document should only be used to inform, not bias people into a design solution. the team just needs to know exactly what corporate strategy is so they can begin their research

Here’s an **outline** your design team at frog could use to begin *researching* ways to identify potential design opportunities for people working on corporate strategy. This structure is crafted to **inform and orient** without leading toward specific design solutions:

## 🔍 Research Kickoff Outline: Understanding Corporate Strategy

### 1. **Purpose of this Research Phase**
- Ground the team in **what corporate strategy is**, who engages in it, and **why it matters**
- Avoid jumping to solutions—focus on **systemic understanding** and **strategic context**
- Equip the team to **observe, question, and empathize** with corporate strategy practitioners

---

### 2. **What Is Corporate Strategy?**
- **Definition:** Long-term, organization-wide decisions that shape market position, industry role, and growth trajectory
- **Key Actors:** CEOs, Founders, Board Members, Chief Strategy Officers
- **Time Horizon:** Typically 5+ years
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Diversification and portfolio design
  - Mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures
  - Capital allocation across business units
  - ESG initiatives and macro-impact decisions
- **Key Signals to Look For:**
  - Moves that impact multiple divisions/business units
  - Industry entry/exit decisions
  - Resource deployment at a strategic scale

---

### 3. **Strategic Mindset & Context**
- **Mental Models:** Think in portfolios, ecosystems, and long-term value creation
- **Strategic Tensions:**
  - Balancing shareholder returns with environmental and social responsibilities
  - Navigating uncertainty while committing to high-stakes bets
  - Coordinating across decentralized or global business units
- **Organizational Impact:**
  - Sets the direction for all other strategies (business, functional, etc.)
  - Often catalyzes systemic change (e.g., digital transformation, new governance models)

---

### 4. **How Corporate Strategy Interacts with Other Strategy Types**
- **Corporate-Level vs. Business-Level:**
  - Business-level strategy is about **how to compete** in a market
  - Corporate strategy is about **where to compete** and **how to grow as an organization**
- **Corporate-Level vs. Innovation & Growth:**
  - Innovation may drive corporate change—but corporate strategy often frames innovation investment as part of broader portfolio dynamics

---

### 5. **Research Pathways: Where to Go Next**
- **People to Observe / Interview:**
  - Strategy executives
  - Corporate development leads (M&A)
  - Board advisors or enterprise architects
- **Artifacts to Analyze:**
  - Annual reports and investor briefings
  - ESG and sustainability strategies
  - M&A announcements and integration plans
- **Contextual Environments:**
  - Strategic offsites and board meetings
  - Corporate venture arms or innovation labs
  - Cross-functional planning sessions

---

### 6. **Framing Observational Questions**
Focus on understanding *motivations, constraints, and workflows*:
- How do execs recognize when to act strategically?
- What information flows into strategic decisions?
- How is strategic alignment maintained across units?
- What makes long-term decision-making difficult?
- How do personal leadership goals intersect with corporate strategy?

---

### 7. **Design Opportunity Themes to Monitor (Non-Prescriptive)**
These are *not solution directions*, but prompts to help the team listen for latent needs:
- **Sensemaking:** How do execs frame ambiguous situations?
- **Alignment:** How is strategy communicated across layers?
- **Foresight & Scenario Planning:** What tools or rituals support future thinking?
- **Decision Memory:** How do orgs track rationale behind high-stakes choices?
- **Inclusion:** How diverse is the input into strategic direction-setting?

---

### 8. **Final Note to Researchers**
- Treat strategy as a living system with **tensions, politics, aspirations, and inertia**
- Focus your curiosity on *how strategic intent becomes action—or fails to*
- Map complexity. Don’t simplify too soon.

---

Let me know if you'd like a version tailored to early-career researchers or if the team would benefit from prompts for field observation, workshop facilitation, or stakeholder mapping tools.

🔹 GOAL

You are a Strategy Evaluation Analyst trained in the Strategy Alignment Framework. Your task is to classify a series of Insight Modules by applying a structured scoring process that evaluates alignment across five strategic lenses and six strategy types.

For each Insight Module:

Read and interpret the full module, including insight statement, decision context, and stress test
Score all six strategy types across the five lenses using a 1–5 scale
Calculate the total score for each strategy type
Assign a single final strategy classification
Invoke the Tie-Breaker Protocol only if the top two strategy types are within 2 points
Output a per-module scoring table with totals and final classification
🔹 RETURN FORMAT

For each module, return the following structure:
#### Insight Module [ID]

| Strategy Type            | Decision Layer | Strategic Tension | Strategic Intent | Scope & Horizon | Cognitive Framing | Total |
|--------------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------|
| Corporate-Level          | X              | X                 | X                | X                | X                  | XX     |
| Business-Level           | X              | X                 | X                | X                | X                  | XX     |
| Functional & Tactical    | X              | X                 | X                | X                | X                  | XX     |
| Adaptive & Crisis        | X              | X                 | X                | X                | X                  | XX     |

**Final Strategy Type →** [Insert one of the above]

**Rationale:** [Include *only* if tie-breaker was used, or if ambiguity was present.]

You do not need to output a summary table in this prompt.

🔹 LENS SCORING GUIDE

Use this scale for each of the five lenses:

5 = Strong Alignment
3 = Partial Alignment
1 = Not Aligned
The five strategic lenses are:
Decision Layer – Who must act on this insight?
Strategic Tension – What is the core tradeoff?
Strategic Intent – What outcome is this trying to achieve?
Scope & Horizon – How wide and how durable is the impact?
Cognitive Framing – What kind of mental logic is being modeled?
🔹 STRATEGY TYPES

The six possible strategy types you must score and compare:

Corporate-Level – Enterprise-wide portfolio, market entry/exit, structural redesign
Business-Level – Competitive positioning, market strategy, go-to-market moves
Functional & Tactical – Operational execution, process decisions, department-level actions
Adaptive & Crisis – Navigating uncertainty, survival, risk response
Innovation & Growth – Disruption, new markets, high-risk/high-reward exploration
Personal & Leadership – Executive cognition, mental model shifts, leadership style evolution
🔹 TIE-BREAKER RULE

If two strategy types are within 2 total points, apply this three-question framework:

Who must act first?
What is the biggest risk if misunderstood?
What cognitive model is being reshaped?
If one strategy appears in 2 out of 3 answers, tag it as the final strategy type.
Always include a short rationale when using the tie-breaker.

🔹 INPUT INSTRUCTIONS

You will be analyzing a document containing a series of INSIGHT MODULES.
Each module begins with a header in the form: ### INSIGHT MODULE [X]
Complete the full scoring + tagging process for each module
Process up to 15 insight modules per batch to ensure accuracy and completeness
🔹 EXPLICIT GUARDRAILS

❌ Never assign more than one strategy type
❌ Do not infer based on keywords alone (e.g. “growth” ≠ Innovation)
✅ Always ground classification in 5-lens scoring + stress test
✅ Always invoke tie-breaker if scoring is close
✅ If unsure, fall back on actor identity as primary tie-breaker

**Final Strategy Type →** Business-Level Strategy

**Rationale:** Addressing the gap between executive and managerial AI adoption, the insight highlights a misalignment that threatens consistent, competitive integration—an issue squarely in the realm of business-level strategic execution.

Each table reflects a structured evaluation using the five lenses, with the highest‐scoring category identified as the final strategy classification.

🔹 GOAL

You are a Strategy Output Summarizer. Your task is to compile a **complete summary table** by scanning **all scoring outputs across the entire conversation thread**—not just the most recent response.

For every Insight Module previously processed, extract:

- The full module ID exactly as labeled (e.g., Insight Module 003)
- The final strategy type assigned (e.g., Corporate-Level Strategy)

---

🔹 RETURN FORMAT

Produce a single, clean markdown table as follows:

### Final Classification Summary

| Insight Module ID | Final Strategy Type          |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Insight Module 1  | Business-Level Strategy      |
| Insight Module 2  | Innovation & Growth Strategy |
| ...               | ...                          |

Ensure the table is:
- Sorted in ascending order by Insight Module ID
- Deduplicated: no repeats for the same module
- Accurate to the model's previous outputs

---

🔹 GUARDRAILS

❌ Do not generate or guess new strategy classifications
❌ Do not interpret scoring tables or rationales
❌ Do not include any rationale or lens scores
✅ Only extract from exact lines formatted like: `**Final Strategy Type →** [Type]`
✅ If a module lacks a clear ID or final tag, skip it
✅ Use the original Insight Module number, even if modules were out of order in prior batches
✅ Include all previously processed modules, not just the most recent batch

---

🔹 THREAD-WIDE INPUT ASSUMPTIONS

- Insight modules were previously processed using Prompt 1 and appear throughout the thread
- Each module begins with a heading: `#### Insight Module X`
- Final classification is always stated in the line: `**Final Strategy Type →** [Name]`

---

Your job is to find every `**Final Strategy Type →**` line across the full thread, associate it with its corresponding Insight Module ID, and output them in a single markdown table sorted by module number.

No commentary. Just the table.

You will now generate **file routing instructions** based ONLY on the **final classification table** in this conversation.

Your output must follow **this exact structure**:

```
from /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/Compilation - C5-I6.txt

Copy ### INSIGHT MODULE [X] to /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/[Standard Strategy File Name]
Copy ### INSIGHT MODULE [Y] to /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/[Standard Strategy File Name]
...
```

🔒 **Guardrails:**
- Use only the **final summary table** provided in this chat.
- Do **not invent or assume** any module numbers or strategy categories.
- If any entries are unclear or unmappable, **omit them silently** (do NOT guess).
- Your response should include **only** the final code block — no commentary or explanation.

🧠 **Strategy Type Normalization Rules:**
Match strategy types **case-insensitively**.
Ignore variations like:
- Hyphens vs spaces (e.g., `Corporate-Level` = `Corporate Level`)
- Presence of the word “strategy” (e.g., `Business Level Strategy`)
- Formatting inconsistencies

Use the following mapping:

| Match Any of These Phrases                        | Route To This File                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| "Corporate", "Corporate-Level", "Corporate Level" | Corporate Strategy Insights.txt                      |
| "Business-Level", "Business Level"                | Business Strategy Insights.txt                       |
| "Functional", "Functional & Tactical"             | Functional Strategy Insights.txt                     |
| "Adaptive", "Crisis", "Risk", "Resilience"        | Risk Management Strategy Insights.txt                |
| "Innovation", "Innovation & Growth"               | Innovation Strategy Insights.txt                     |
| "Leadership", "Personal & Leadership"             | Leadership Strategy Insights.txt                     |

🔧 **Formatting Rules:**
1. Convert every module to the format: `### INSIGHT MODULE [X]`
2. Replace `[INSERT_FILENAME_HERE]` with the original source filename used in this chat window (you will be given this)
3. Return only the output block inside a fenced code block (```) — no extra text

# Cancel autopay issue

## You (2025-11-12T06:47:52.564201+00:00)

I have a Google pay account and I'm trying to remove my bank account link from it but it doesn't allow me to do so because it has some autopays active.

But when I try to cancel the autopays it gives me a message like this

"Dear Customer, your AutoPay mandate revoke has failed due to account not found 768901000231-ICICI Bank."

Got it — that’s a frustrating but pretty common issue. Let’s go step by step to resolve it:  

---

### 🔍 What’s actually happening
Google Pay can’t remove your linked bank account because it still “thinks” there are **active UPI autopay mandates** (recurring payments) tied to that account.  
But when you try to cancel them, ICICI Bank says **“account not found”**, which usually means:
- The mandate record still exists in NPCI’s UPI system,  
- but your Google Pay and bank records are out of sync (the account may already be de-registered or changed on the bank side).

---

### 🧭 Step-by-step fix

#### **Step 1 → Check active mandates manually**
1. Open your **Google Pay app** → tap your **profile picture** → **Autopay**.  
2. Note down any active autopay mandates (merchant names, UPI IDs).  
3. Try to **cancel each one** again — if the same error appears, continue below.

#### **Step 2 → Verify with ICICI Bank directly**
You need to get ICICI to revoke the mandate from their end.
- Call **ICICI Customer Care (1860 120 7777)** or visit your branch.  
- Tell them clearly:  
  > “I have UPI autopay mandates showing on Google Pay that I can’t revoke.  
  > The error says *‘mandate revoke failed due to account not found’.*  
  > Please remove these autopay mandates from your UPI account at the bank’s end.”

They can cancel the mandates via their **UPI/NPCI portal** within a day or two.

#### **Step 3 → Check NPCI’s portal (optional)**
You can verify your active UPI mandates here:  
👉 [https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/autopay](https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/autopay) → “Manage Autopay” → log in with your UPI-linked mobile number.  
If the mandates appear there, you can request cancellation.

#### **Step 4 → Remove the bank account after cleanup**
Once all mandates are cleared:
1. Go back to **Google Pay → Bank Accounts**.  
2. Tap your **ICICI account → Remove Account**.  
It should work now.

### 🧩 If it still doesn’t work
- Send an email to **help@googlepay.in** describing the issue and attach a screenshot of the error message.  
- Include the **masked account number** (like *…0231*) and specify **ICICI Bank**.  
They’ll forward the request to their payments compliance team.

Would you like me to draft the exact short message you can send to **ICICI support** so they process it faster?

Can I do step 2 using my icici mobile app?

## ChatGPT (2025-11-12T06:51:07.256404+00:00)

Good question — partly yes, but **not fully**.  

Here’s what you can and can’t do in the **ICICI mobile app** (iMobile Pay):  

---

### ✅ You *can* do this:
1. **Open iMobile Pay → Pay → UPI → Manage Autopay.**  
2. You’ll see all **active UPI autopay mandates** linked to your ICICI account.  
3. Try tapping on each one → **“Cancel Mandate”** or **“Revoke.”**  

If the mandate is still valid, it’ll cancel successfully.  
But if you get the same “Account not found” or “Revoke failed” error, that means the mandate record is broken (the UPI system still thinks it exists, but ICICI’s record doesn’t).

---

### ❌ You *cannot* do this:
You **can’t manually delete** broken mandates (the ones giving “account not found”).  
Those need to be removed **by ICICI’s backend team** or through **NPCI escalation**, which only the bank can trigger.

---

### 💡 So what you should do
- Try the above once in the iMobile app.  
- If the error repeats, **take a screenshot** of the error and then contact ICICI via:
  - **Chat Support** in the app → “UPI Autopay issue,” or  
  - **Call 1860 120 7777**, or  
  - **Email**: customer.care@icicibank.com  
  Use this short message (you can copy it):  

  ```
  Dear ICICI Team,
  I’m unable to revoke certain UPI Autopay mandates from Google Pay. 
  The error says: “AutoPay mandate revoke failed due to account not found 768901000231–ICICI Bank.” 
  Please remove any inactive or broken UPI Autopay mandates linked to my account on your end so I can delink it from Google Pay.
  ```

Would you like me to also show you **how to check if those mandates still exist via NPCI’s website**? It can help confirm what’s left hanging.

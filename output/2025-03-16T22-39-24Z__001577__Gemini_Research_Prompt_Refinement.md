# Gemini Research Prompt Refinement

## You (2025-03-16T22:39:24.860000+00:00)

Hey, I had this one prompt for Gemini and my objective. My main objective was to have a very long comprehensive list of links or resources that I could use to conduct my own analysis but unfortunately when I use this prompt what's happening is it is basically going through all the content itself, and then summarizing the list for me and summarizing all the content for me I don't want it to summarize. I just wanted to produce a very long list of hyper links for me. Another issue with the Gemini response is even despite telling Gemini that I don't want to go to post I don't want random articles online. I want to keep my search very limited to academic research papers books, and even if there are websites, I gave Gemini a very specific list of websites to refer to, however Gemini continues to override my instructions and it just goes on this wild hunt of different resources. My problem is some of these resources cannot be trusted because the challenge with block posts is that anyone and everyone can write different article articles the main reason people write articles is to gain recognition and once they gain recognition, they can capitalize on that recognition it's sort of a content, heavy world, and just for the sake of some recognition people post random things which are either overly generic overgeneralizing the facts and not producing anything actionable so for this reason alone, I want Gemini to avoid like looking through websites and only focusing on academic research. Could you help me now build a prompt for Gemini de research that could address some of my concerns and align more with the end outcome that I want.


Here's the original prompt

Comprehensive Research Prompt for Data Collection Using Gemini
Objective:
Conduct a deep and comprehensive search to gather relevant resources that explore Business-Level Strategy decision-making frameworks, processes, and AI integration across multiple scenarios. The goal is to provide high-quality, real-world resources that align with the criteria outlined below.

Prompt for Gemini Research Tool

I am conducting a comprehensive research project focused on Business-Level Strategy. The goal is to gather a broad yet relevant collection of resources that explore:
Decision-Making Frameworks and Models used by Business Unit Leaders, General Managers, and Senior Directors.
The role of AI-driven tools and insights in enhancing strategic decision-making processes.
Real-world examples, case studies, and best practices that demonstrate the successful (or unsuccessful) application of these strategies.
Scope of Research
✅ Conduct a thorough investigation into six key Business-Level Strategy decision scenarios:

Market Expansion – Decisions around entering new markets, forming partnerships, and digital expansion.
Product & Service Positioning – Decisions related to product differentiation, feature prioritization, and roadmap strategy.
Resource Allocation – Decisions about budget optimization, talent deployment, and investment trade-offs.
Competitive Response – Decisions made in response to competitor moves, industry disruption, or pricing strategy.
Channel & Distribution Strategy – Decisions regarding sales channels, partner ecosystems, and inventory optimization.
Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) – Decisions around target selection, due diligence, and post-merger integration.
✅ For each scenario, the search should focus on:

Key Decision Criteria – What factors influence decision-making in this scenario?
Frameworks and Models – Established mental models, strategy frameworks, or decision-making theories that guide these choices.
AI Integration – The role of AI tools (e.g., predictive analytics, NLP tools, machine learning models) in improving decision outcomes.
Common Pain Points and Cognitive Biases – Unique challenges executives face in these decision contexts.
Source Prioritization
The search must prioritize the following sources, ensuring the most credible and impactful resources are collected:

✅ Academic Journals — Prioritize well-cited, foundational research for strategy frameworks (even if older), but lean toward recent research for AI advancements.

Recommended journals include: Strategic Management Journal, Harvard Business Review, MIT Sloan Management Review, California Management Review.
✅ Industry Reports & White Papers — Focus on recent insights from leading consulting firms that reflect current trends, AI applications, and practical decision frameworks.

Recommended sources: McKinsey, BCG, Gartner, Forrester, Deloitte Insights.
✅ Conference Proceedings — Search for AI-focused content in conferences known for emerging trends.

Recommended conferences: NeurIPS (AI-focused), INFORMS (Decision Science), and AAAI Conference Papers.
✅ Case Studies — Seek detailed, real-world examples where companies implemented strategic decisions.

Prioritize cases that demonstrate decision frameworks in action or reveal the role of AI in strategy.
✅ Executive Memoirs & Insights — Include insights from influential business leaders, particularly those reflecting on real-world strategic decisions.

Examples: Satya Nadella’s “Hit Refresh”, Ben Horowitz’s “The Hard Thing About Hard Things”.
Search Criteria & Precision
To ensure maximum relevance, apply the following criteria:

✅ Date Range:

For AI-driven insights, prioritize publications from 2019 onward to reflect the latest developments.
For decision-making frameworks, include older foundational models if they are widely cited or still relevant in practice.
✅ Search Keywords: Combine decision scenario terms with AI-related terminology for highly targeted searches. Examples include:

(“Market expansion” AND “risk assessment” AND “AI forecasting”)
(“Product positioning” AND “AI-enhanced testing” AND “customer sentiment analysis”)
(“Resource allocation” AND “AI optimization” AND “budget strategy”)
(“Competitive response” AND “machine learning” AND “market shifts”)
(“M&A strategy” AND “AI valuation models” AND “post-merger integration”)
✅ Boolean Operators: Use combinations of AND, OR, and NOT to refine search precision.

✅ Resource Screening: Prioritize content that includes:

Clear frameworks or structured decision-making models
Case studies or examples with actionable insights
Comparative studies that evaluate multiple strategic models
Visual frameworks that simplify complex concepts
Data Presentation & Organization
All gathered resources should be organized clearly in the following structure:

Category	Resource Link	Brief Summary/Justification
Market Expansion	[Link]	Explains AI’s role in market risk forecasting, with a strong emphasis on real-world case studies.
Product & Service Positioning	[Link]	Provides a comprehensive overview of product positioning frameworks using sentiment analysis data.
Resource Allocation	[Link]	Discusses AI-driven budgeting tools used by large enterprises for strategic resource planning.
Competitive Response	[Link]	Highlights real-world scenarios where companies adjusted strategies based on AI-driven competitor insights.
Channel & Distribution Strategy	[Link]	Explains AI-enabled demand forecasting for inventory control in omnichannel retail.
Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)	[Link]	Focuses on AI valuation models for acquisition targets and post-merger integration strategies.
Key Reminders for Gemini
Emphasize real-world relevance — Prioritize resources that offer clear, practical insights over abstract or theoretical discussions.
Prioritize AI integration insights — Particularly where AI augments strategic decision-making (e.g., predictive models, NLP analysis, etc.).
Balance depth and breadth — The search should aim for maximum coverage across all six scenarios while ensuring each is treated distinctly.
Highlight influential thought models — Even if older, prioritize landmark frameworks that remain foundational in strategic thinking.
Provide ample variety — Include diverse perspectives from different industries, markets, and organizational structures.
Success Criteria
The final output should contain:
✅ Minimum of 8–10 highly relevant resources per decision scenario.
✅ Each entry must include a hyperlink, brief description, and justification for inclusion.
✅ A well-structured result with categories reflecting the six decision scenarios.
✅ A mix of AI-specific content, strategy frameworks, and real-world examples to ensure the insights are applicable.

Final Thought
This prompt is designed to equip the research team with a highly targeted, organized collection of insights that align with your strategic focus. If you’d like me to refine the query strategy for specific industries, verticals, or framework preferences, I'm happy to iterate further.

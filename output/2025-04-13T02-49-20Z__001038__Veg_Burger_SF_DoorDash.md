## You (2025-04-13T02:49:20.710341+00:00)

help me find the ideal burger in san francisco that i can order on doordash. Make sure i can order it on doordash. I'm a vegetarian so I need a burger that's vegan or vegetarian. so things like black bean burger, mushroom burger, etc.. Meat replacements like impossible meat are not an option. I like on Van Ness Ave, so keep the SF City Hall as the landmark if you'd like to make sure about the location. 

Make sure you're not only keeping general cuztomer feedback from google maps and yelp to help me find the right option, but also some editorial opinions on the best burger options. Some amount of customizability is great. I don't like overly greesy burgers. There were a lot of vegetarian burger places in india i used to like but unfortunately we're not in india. Also avoid mcdonals, arbys, carls jr, and burger king. Food chains are fine, but local businesses are preferred.

Thanks! A few quick clarifications to help me find the perfect vegetarian burger for you on DoorDash:

1. Do you have a preferred price range per burger or meal (e.g., under $15)?
2. Are you okay with dairy and eggs in the burger (vegetarian), or do you prefer fully vegan?
3. Any ingredient preferences to avoid (e.g., spicy sauces, mayo, onions)?

1. **Wildseed Burger – Wildseed** (Cow Hollow, SF) – *Patty:* House-made mushroom and spinach patty. *Customization:* Comes with grilled onions, lettuce, roasted tomato chutney, and vegan chipotle aioli; you can add cheese, avocado, or tempeh bacon for extra【51†L219-L227】. *DoorDash:* [Wildseed on DoorDash](https://www.doordash.com/store/wildseed-san-francisco-297598/). **Summary:** This 100% plant-based restaurant’s signature burger proves that veggie burgers can be truly crave-worthy.

Wildseed is frequently recommended in local vegan/vegetarian guides for delivering big flavor in a purely veggie burger, and it’s available for delivery via DoorDash to the Civic Center area.

This burger is lauded for its **garlic tahini sauce and creamy guac**, which complement the crunchy patties perfectly【7†L197-L205】. Diners love that it isn’t mushy – the double-patty is crisp yet moist, avoiding the common veggie burger pitfall【7†L207-L214】. At roughly **$12–$14**, it’s a great value. Reviews (and a Chronicle first-look) mention that even among Arbor’s meat offerings, the vegan burger stands out for its flavor punch【38†L427-L435】【38†L445-L453】.

Popular choices include the **French ‘N Fries** style (topped with truffle Parmesan fries, brie cheese, avocado, caramelized onions, greens, and a mustardy “piquant” sauce【60†L173-L181】) or the BBQ-infused **Tejano** style, among others. You can also build your own with toppings like fried egg or pickled jalapeños. *DoorDash:* [Roam (Fillmore St.) on DoorDash](https://www.doordash.com/store/roam-artisan-burgers-san-francisco-4611/). **Summary:** Roam’s veggie burger is frequently cited as one of SF’s best for its **robust flavor and versatility**. The beet-quinoa patty is moist but holds together well, with a hearty texture that doesn’t try to imitate meat but instead celebrates veggies (even self-professed beet-skeptics enjoy it)【60†L173-L181】【44†L19-L23】. You can get this patty on any of Roam’s signature builds – for example, local food writers loved the **French ‘N Fries** version for its decadent mix of crispy fries and truffle aroma on top of the earthy patty【60†L173-L181】.

4. **Veggie Burger – Pearl’s Deluxe Burgers** (Lower Nob Hill, SF) – *Patty:* Classic **vegetable and grain patty** (contains egg whites as a binder, so not vegan【26†L1-L3】 – think along the lines of a savory garden burger). *Customization:* Highly customizable – you can get it “Deluxe” with lettuce, tomato, onion & mayo, add cheese, or try Pearl’s special combos using the veggie patty. They offer it with cheese and sautéed mushrooms (a popular choice)【26†L31-L34】, and you can likely substitute the veggie patty into any of their signature burgers (like the spicy Bula or teriyaki Hawaiian) at no extra charge. *DoorDash:* [Pearl’s Deluxe on DoorDash](https://www.doordash.com/store/pearl's-deluxe-burgers-san-francisco-23178083/). **Summary:** A longtime local favorite, Pearl’s Deluxe is known for its **no-frills, delicious burgers**, and their veggie burger is often cited as one of the best in the city. The patty has a traditional veggie mix (no fake meat), giving a **savory black-bean-like flavor** with a bit of chew from grains – it’s even enjoyed by non-vegetarians. Numerous reviewers note that *“the star of the meal… was the burger – just a really great veggie burger,”* despite Pearl’s beef options (per Yelp) – evidence that the veggie offering holds its own. Customers love adding melty cheese and mushrooms to complement the patty【26†L31-L34】, resulting in a satisfying umami bomb without any meat. At about **$13** for the basic veggie (around **$15–$17** with cheese, mushrooms or other toppings), it’s reasonably priced given Pearl’s quality. The **portion is generous** and often paired with their famous garlic fries or onion rings. Pearl’s has been ranked highly (#2 in SF on TripAdvisor for veggie burgers) and is a **trusted option for flavor and freshness**. It’s a small, local burger joint, and you can get their food delivered on DoorDash to the Van Ness/Civic Center area in around 30 minutes. If you want a classic take on a veggie burger that’s stood the test of time, Pearl’s is a top contender【26†L1-L3】.

5. **Veggie Burger (House-Made Patty) – Bandit** (Mission Dolores, SF; formerly in Tenderloin) – *Patty:* **Vegan house-made patty** – Bandit prides itself on a from-scratch veggie patty (no Impossible used) made with vegetables/legumes (exact mix closely held, but it’s vegan and not soy-based)【23†L39-L42】. *Customization:* Served on a brioche or *optional* vegan/gluten-free bun. Typically comes dressed with Bandit sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, etc., similar to their standard burger, and you can add avocado or even an egg or cheese if desired (to make it vegetarian instead of fully vegan). *DoorDash:* [Bandit on DoorDash](https://www.doordash.com/store/bandit-san-francisco-26274169/) (Dolores St. location). **Summary:** Bandit is a hip burger spot known for its indulgent creations, and its veggie burger has a **cult following**. The house-made patty is often praised for its **“fresh, hearty flavor”** – one DoorDash reviewer raved it was *“definitely one of the best veggie burgers I’ve had in a long time,”* even matching the quality of gourmet veggie burgers【22†L1-L4】. Unlike many places that rely on Beyond/Impossible, Bandit crafts their patty in-house, which gives it a more **“real food” texture (you can see bits of veggies/grains)**. It’s substantial and not overly greasy, and the fact that it’s vegan means it satisfies a broad range of diets. Bandit typically tops it like a classic burger (their “Bandit sauce” is a tasty house spread), and you can ask for extras; people especially like adding avocado for creaminess. The price is around **$16–$17** (it’s a big burger made with quality ingredients). While Bandit’s original Tenderloin location (683 Geary) was beloved (Yelp often mentioned the great veggie patty), that spot has closed – however, their **Dolores Street location** is active and will deliver to the City Hall area. If you’re looking for a **crafted, non-imitation veggie burger** that’s earned rave customer reviews, Bandit is an excellent choice【23†L39-L42】【22†L1-L4】.

6. **“Honey Hippie” Veggie Burger – Tony’s Slice House (Haight-Ashbury)** – *Patty:* Hearty patty made from **brown rice, oats, and quinoa**【60†L167-L175】. *Customization:* This is a signature burger build created by pizzaiolo Tony Gemignani. It comes standard with melted mozzarella, arugula, raw red onion, *peppadew peppers*, and a drizzle of honey on a soft bun【60†L167-L175】. While not much customization is needed (it’s a well-designed combo), you could ask for no honey if you prefer less sweetness or add extra cheese. *DoorDash:* [Tony’s Slice House (Haight) on DoorDash](https://www.doordash.com/store/slice-house-haight-ashbury-san-francisco-73262/). **Summary:** Nicknamed the “Honey Hippie,” this burger is a **sweet-savory twist** on a veggie burger and has garnered praise for its unique flavor profile. The patty itself is mild and a bit plain in taste (as one local review noted) but has a good, **semi-firm texture** that holds up【60†L167-L175】. The magic here is in the toppings: the **gooey mozzarella and spicy-sweet peppadew peppers** with a touch of honey create an addictive contrast that elevates the whole burger. In fact, a Bay Area food writer described it as *“glorious with all the toppings”*【60†L167-L175】 – the peppery arugula, tangy peppadews, and honey make each bite exciting. This burger isn’t very greasy and comes on a quality artisan bun. At about **$14**, it’s a great choice when you want something a little different than the usual bean burger. Tony Gemignani is famous for his pizzas, but he’s quietly made a mark with this vegetarian burger as well. Delivery is available via DoorDash from the Haight location (which is roughly 2 miles from City Hall). Overall, the Honey Hippie is **widely admired for its flavor combo** – especially if you appreciate a hint of sweetness to play off the savory elements.

7. **Veggie Burger – Super Duper Burgers** (Various SF locations) – *Patty:* **Organic veggie patty made in-house** (ingredients include things like lentils, mushrooms, possibly soy and cheese – it’s vegetarian and the patty itself is vegan【29†L186-L194】). *Customization:* Highly customizable. Super Duper serves the veggie burger with their usual fixings (lettuce, tomato, red onion, plus a schmear of house-made hummus and cucumbers by default)【28†L17-L20】. You can add cheese, swap sauces, or basically treat it like any burger – they offer free extras like jalapeños, grilled onions, and their “super sauce.” It’s a fast-casual spot, so you can easily request tweaks. *DoorDash:* [Super Duper (Market St.) on DoorDash](https://www.doordash.com/store/super-duper-burgers-san-francisco-11000/36521150/). **Summary:** Super Duper is a local mini-chain, and while it’s more casual than the others on this list, its veggie burger is **consistently rated highly** for flavor and value. In taste tests, it held its own against pricier options – *“the veggie burger at Super Duper… is just as good as most of them,”* noted one review【60†L185-L193】. The patty has a nice balance of veggies and grains (with a bit of **umami from mushrooms and soy**), and it’s grilled to have a slight crisp outside. What sets Super Duper apart is the execution and fixings: the fresh hummus and crunchy pickles/cucumbers give the veggie burger a **Mediterranean twist**, and you still get the classic lettuce-tomato-onion for that burger familiarity. It’s also the **least greasy option**, yet still satisfying. At about **$8–$9** for the burger (one of the more affordable picks)【60†L185-L193】, it’s an awesome everyday veggie burger. You can also catch seasonal veggie burger specials here – for example, they’ve offered a spicy Poblano Veggie Burger with avocado and chipotle aioli in the past【60†L187-L194】. Super Duper has several locations (the Metreon and Castro locations are within delivery range of Civic Center), and DoorDash delivery is quick due to multiple outlets. Overall, this burger is **praised for its fresh taste and unbeatable value**, making it a go-to choice for many SF vegetarians who want something simple but delicious.

Each of these burgers is **100% vegetarian (no meat or fish)** and avoids the use of Impossible/Beyond substitutes, focusing instead on beans, mushrooms, and veggies for their flavor and texture.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-13T03:31:11.697819+00:00)

Yes, vegan **tteokbokki** (also spelled **teok-bokki** or 떡볶이) absolutely exists, and it can be super flavorful even without the traditional fish cakes or anchovy-based broth.

### What makes traditional tteokbokki *non-vegan*:
- **Fish cakes (eomuk)** – commonly added to give flavor and protein
- **Anchovy broth** – the soup base often uses dried anchovies and kelp
- **Gochujang (Korean chili paste)** – often contains small amounts of fermented anchovy or shrimp, depending on the brand

---

### How vegan tteokbokki is made:
- **Rice cakes (tteok)** – naturally vegan (made from rice flour + water)
- **Broth** – replaced with a kombu (kelp), shiitake, or miso-based broth
- **Gochujang** – use a vegan-certified brand (like *Chung Jung One* or *Sempio vegan gochujang*)
- **Add-ins** – mushrooms, tofu, scallions, cabbage, carrots, or even vegan cheese can be added

---

### Where to find it:
- Some **Korean restaurants in SF** or fusion spots might offer it with modifications (I can look some up for you)
- Pre-made **vegan tteokbokki kits** exist too — popular ones are sold by **Unlimeat**, **O’Food**, and **Yopokki** (check for the vegan versions)
- Homemade is super doable — let me know if you want a quick vegan recipe

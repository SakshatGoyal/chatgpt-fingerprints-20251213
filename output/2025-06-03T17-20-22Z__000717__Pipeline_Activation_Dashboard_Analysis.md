# Pipeline Activation Dashboard Analysis

## You (2025-06-03T17:20:22.538000+00:00)

I'm attaching two screenshots. are you able to understand what this table aims to achieve?

## ChatGPT (2025-06-03T17:20:24.595307+00:00)

Yes, I can interpret the intent of these screenshots. You're looking at a **pipeline coverage and activation dashboard** that segments **unworked opportunity volume** across multiple sales plays within Palo Alto Networks' portfolio, segmented by **geo (NAM, WW, JAPAC, EMEA)**.

### Purpose of the Table:

This table is designed to:
1. **Visualize dormant pipeline** — showing large quantities of **"Not Touched"** and **"Total Potential Identified"** opportunities per play.
2. **Segment by ownership** — each sales motion (e.g., Hardware Refresh, Fortinet Displacement, GP to Prisma Access, XSIAM Takeout, etc.) is led by a specific AE team (Core AE, Cortex-Cloud Specialist, etc.).
3. **Help drive pipeline activation** — it's a strategic tool for RVPs, DSMs, and Core/Cortex/SASE AEs to prioritize outreach where there’s high-value untouched pipeline.
4. **Track engagement stages** — from "Not Touched" → "Pitched" → "Customer Interested".
5. **Highlight play-specific targets** — the table makes it clear which GTM motions have large unworked potential, e.g.:
   - **XSIAM Splunk Takeout** has $1.2B untouched globally.
   - **GP to Prisma Access** has $3.82B not touched out of $5.17B.

### Why this matters for an AE:

- **Prioritization**: Helps AEs laser-focus on white space with high return.
- **MEDDPICC entry point**: This data helps you initiate conversations tied to Metrics (e.g., cost savings in Splunk takeout), Pain (e.g., Fortinet churn risk), or Champion building (where interest is shown).
- **Territory coverage discipline**: If you’re in NAM and see Hardware Refresh with $166M untouched, you know what to act on next.
- **Cross-functional activation**: Cortex Cloud GTM looks dry — maybe specialists need help activating plays or don’t have awareness of TAM.

Let me know if you’d like help crafting a territory plan, AE activation strategy, or outreach email sequence based on this view.

## You (2025-06-03T17:21:14.202000+00:00)

Remind me again, what's MEDDPICC?

## ChatGPT (2025-06-03T17:21:14.823910+00:00)

Absolutely — **MEDDPICC** is a qualification framework used by top-performing AEs (especially at Palo Alto Networks) to rigorously qualify, advance, and close complex deals. It's a blueprint for assessing deal health and driving disciplined execution across your pipeline.

Here's the breakdown:

---

### 🔍 **M** – **Metrics**
Quantifiable measures of value your solution delivers.
> *Example: "We can reduce your mean time to detect by 80%, cutting $1.2M in SOC operational costs."*

---

### 🧠 **E** – **Economic Buyer**
The person who signs the check and owns the budget.
> *Example: CIO, CISO, or VP of Infrastructure with final approval authority.*

---

### 📅 **D** – **Decision Criteria**
The technical, commercial, and strategic factors driving their decision.
> *Example: Integration with AWS, performance benchmarks, cost-to-value ratio.*

---

### 📈 **D** – **Decision Process**
The actual steps, stakeholders, and timing of how decisions are made.
> *Example: RFP > Technical Eval > Business Case > EB Approval > PO.*

---

### 🩹 **P** – **Paper Process**
Everything post-verbal yes: legal, procurement, vendor onboarding.
> *Example: Security review, legal redlines, InfoSec due diligence.*

---

### 🧲 **I** – **Identified Pain**
The urgent, strategic pain your solution uniquely solves.
> *Example: “We missed a breach due to tool sprawl and visibility gaps.”*

---

### 💬 **C** – **Champion**
An internal advocate with power, influence, and a personal win if you win.
> *Example: Director of SecOps who’s gunning for a promotion and needs a win.*

---

### 👀 **C** – **Competition**
Who you're up against (vendors, do-nothing, in-house) and how you're positioned.
> *Example: CrowdStrike is in play, but can’t do full XDR + SOAR orchestration.*

---

**Why it matters**: At Palo Alto Networks, MEDDPICC isn't just a checklist — it's how we **forecast accurately**, **uncover blind spots**, and **coach reps toward winning behavior.**

Would you like a MEDDPICC template or checklist tailored to a specific play like “XSIAM - Splunk Takeout” or “GP to Prisma Access”?

## You (2025-06-03T17:23:05.596000+00:00)

ok so from the table, what can you understand out of the headers?

## ChatGPT (2025-06-03T17:23:06.367313+00:00)

Great question — let’s break down what the **headers** in the table tell us, and how a Palo Alto Networks AE (or DSM) would interpret and use them strategically.

---

### 🔠 **Header Sections Overview:**

Each **header column** represents a **specific sales play** (also known as a GTM motion or campaign), organized under product families:

---

#### 🔴 **FW & CDSS** *(NGFW + Services-Led Motions)*

- **Hardware Refresh** – Focused on displacing aging PANW gear (e.g., PA-3020s) to new platforms like PA-400 or PA-5400.
- **Fortinet Displacement** – Competitive rip-out play targeting Fortinet footprint.
- **SWFW Acceleration (1K)** – Accelerating firewall adoption for accounts with >1,000 users.
- **SWFW Acceleration (NSDC)** – Likely targeting Next-Gen Secure Data Center use cases.
- **SWFW Acceleration (Cloud firewall takeout)** – Displacing legacy cloud firewalls (e.g., AWS, Azure NVA) with PANW VM-Series/CN-Series.

---

#### 🟠 **SASE** *(Prisma Access, SD-WAN, ZTNA)*

- **GP to Prisma Access** – Transition GlobalProtect customers to full Prisma Access.
- **PAB Existing PA Upgrade** – Upgrade existing PAs to SASE bundles.
- **PAB Standalone** – Sell PAB licenses outside of bundle motions.
- **Upsell SD-WAN Customers** – Increase footprint in existing SD-WAN customers.
- **PAB for Partners** – Channel-led motion to push PAB through partners.

---

#### 🔵 **Cortex (EDR, SIEM, SOAR)**

- **XSIAM – Splunk Takeout** – Replace Splunk with XSIAM.
- **XDR Acceleration** – Drive XDR adoption in Cortex XDR customers.

---

#### 🟢 **Cortex Cloud** *(Specialist-led advanced security GTM)*

- **XSIAM Splunk Takeout**
- **XDR Acceleration**
- **Cortex Cloud Land & Attach**
- **QRadar to Cortex Upgrades**
- **XSIAM Splunk Takeout** (again — possible duplication or sub-play)

These are **cloud security and advanced analytics plays**, specialist-led and often requiring technical depth (Proof of Value, API integrations, etc.).

---

#### 🟤 **Unit 42** *(Retainer, Incident Response)*

- **Unit 42 No Cost Retainer** – Free IR retainers that land services and feed platform pull-through.

---

### 🔍 What Each Column Includes:

Under each play, the table shows:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Total Potential Identified** | Count and $ value of potential opportunities across regions. |
| **Not Touched** | Pipeline that's sitting idle — no sales engagement yet. |
| **Pitched** | Actively worked — at least one sales touch, but not necessarily qualified. |
| **Customer Interested** | Sign of engagement, PoV interest, or verbal support from champion. |

Icons under each column header denote **owner personas**:
- 👤 = Core AE
- 🧑‍🔬 = Cortex Cloud Specialist
- ➕ = Add-on motion / upsell

---

### 🧠 AE Takeaway

This table is designed to **triage where to engage next**, based on:

- **High potential** + **low engagement**
- **Plays you own** (Core vs Specialist GTM)
- **Quick hits** for stage 0 pipeline conversion (e.g., XSIAM where verbal interest already exists)
- **Regional focus** if you're aligned to NAM, JAPAC, EMEA

---

Let me know if you want a prioritized hit list based on this data — I can synthesize "where to go next" for a rep in NAM or another region.

## You (2025-06-03T17:23:59.874000+00:00)

what's a sales play?

## ChatGPT (2025-06-03T17:24:00.644088+00:00)

A **sales play** is a **repeatable, strategic GTM (go-to-market) motion** designed to solve a **specific customer problem** using a curated set of Palo Alto Networks products, messaging, and tactics — tailored by persona, segment, and competitive context.

Think of it as a **"battle plan"** for winning deals.

---

### 🧩 Anatomy of a Sales Play

Each sales play typically includes:
| Component | What it Means |
|----------|----------------|
| 🎯 **Target Customer Problem** | A pain point or risk (e.g., SIEM cost explosion, aging firewalls, remote work visibility). |
| 🧠 **Buyer Persona** | Who it’s for: CISO, SOC Lead, CIO, Cloud Architect, etc. |
| 🛠️ **Solution Set** | Specific PANW product(s) + services: e.g., Prisma Access + ADEM + Professional Services. |
| 📣 **Messaging** | Value props, proof points, and competitive differentiation. |
| 🧪 **Sales Tactics** | Email sequences, talk tracks, MEDDPICC hooks, PoV guides. |
| 🤝 **Internal Ownership** | Core AE, Cortex Specialist, SASE overlay, etc. |

---

### 🧭 Why Sales Plays Matter (for AEs)

- **Prioritization** – Focus on the highest-propensity use cases.
- **Repeatability** – Instead of starting from scratch, plug into what already works.
- **Collaboration** – Aligns marketing, overlays, SEs, and channel on one GTM path.
- **Forecast Confidence** – Plays are often built around conversion benchmarks.

---

### 🔥 Examples in Context

| Sales Play | Problem it Solves | PANW Products |
|------------|--------------------|---------------|
| **XSIAM – Splunk Takeout** | Legacy SIEM cost + low ROI | XSIAM + Cortex XDR + ProServ |
| **Hardware Refresh** | Aging PANW gear or expiring support | PA-400, PA-5400, Strata NGFW |
| **GP to Prisma Access** | Legacy VPN isn't scalable or secure | Prisma Access + ZTNA |
| **Fortinet Displacement** | Competitive installed base | Full stack NGFW + Threat Prevention |

---

If you're an AE, you use sales plays to:
- **Uncover dormant pipeline** (like in the screenshots)
- **Run outbound sequences**
- **Create urgency** with a specific pain/value story
- **Accelerate deal velocity** by aligning resources (SEs, overlays, POV kits)

Want help selecting the right sales play for a specific account or territory motion?

## You (2025-06-03T21:35:20.379000+00:00)

Could you help me ideate on different ways for someone to sort through a long list of sales plays? I mean, some I have in mind are dollar value and propensity to close; and they're mostly based on how actionable they are. Do you have a few others in mind?

give me your suggestions based on your experience in the field, and help me understand how it would be calculated and what value it gives to you

## ChatGPT (2025-06-03T21:35:21.337807+00:00)

Absolutely — this is a **high-leverage question** that separates high-performing AEs from reactive ones. Sorting through a long list of sales plays needs to go beyond just pipeline dollar value — the real art is **prioritizing based on actionability, ROI, and likelihood of success given your territory, timing, and team dynamics.**

Here’s a framework I’ve seen work well in the field, with **6 prioritization filters** you can apply — each with *how to calculate*, *why it matters*, and *how it helps you win*:

---

### 1. 💸 **Total Pipeline Dollar Value (Standard)**
**How to use:** Sum of “Total Potential Identified” for each play in your patch.
**Why it matters:** Tells you where the largest possible return is.
**Pro tip:** Use this as a *capacity filter*, not a *priority filter* — high value doesn’t always mean high actionability.

---

### 2. 🧮 **Propensity to Close / Win Rate**
**How to calculate:** Use historical data by segment and product line. For example:
- Cortex XDR has 35% close rate in Mid-Market
- GP to Prisma has 18% in Enterprise
**Why it matters:** Efficiency. You want to spend time where your energy converts to ARR.
**Bonus:** Ask RevOps or your DSM for this by vertical or region.

---

### 3. 🚦 **Actionability Score (Velocity Readiness)**
**How to calculate:** Assign 1–5 score based on:
- Has a named account? ✔️
- Assigned owner? ✔️
- Not Touched status = 1
- Champion identified = 1
- Active interest = 1
→ **Sum it**.
**Why it matters:** Prioritizes *plays that you can move this quarter*.
**Value:** This filters for quick wins and PoV-ready pipeline.

---

### 4. ⏳ **Time Sensitivity / Aging Risk**
**How to use:** Sort by last touch + aging since identification.
**Why it matters:** Opportunities go stale. If something’s untouched for 120+ days, it’s dying.
**Value:** Drives proactive salvage before the pipeline goes cold.

---

### 5. 🏁 **Sales Stage Leverage (Stage Proximity to Close)**
**How to calculate:** Count of opps at Stage 2+ or where Paper Process is known.
**Why it matters:** You might have a $500K XSIAM opportunity that’s already in Legal and a $1.5M GP-to-Prisma deal that’s untouched — one helps you hit this Q, one helps next.
**Value:** Ensures you’re not "chasing tomorrow at the expense of today."

---

### 6. 🔀 **Strategic Alignment Score**
**How to score:**
- Does it align to QBR goals or BU incentives?
- Tied to PEPM / AE comp multiplier?
- Supported by overlay or partner?
**Why it matters:** Some plays get more resources, incentives, and exec coverage.
**Value:** If Cortex Cloud is a company priority, it might get SEs, POV kits, and exec lift — use that tailwind.

---

### Bonus: 📊 **Composite Prioritization Matrix**

You could build a quick matrix that scores each sales play across:
| Metric | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| $ Value | 20% |
| Win Rate | 15% |
| Actionability | 25% |
| Stage Leverage | 15% |
| Strategic Alignment | 25% |

Rank plays by total score. Now you’re not just reacting to size — you’re **prioritizing for impact.**

---

### TL;DR: Use These Filters

| Filter | When to Use |
|--------|--------------|
| 💰 Dollar Value | To know total upside |
| 📈 Win Rate | To focus where you’re strong |
| 🚀 Actionability | To find deals you can move now |
| ⏱️ Aging Risk | To revive fading opps |
| 🏁 Stage Proximity | To forecast accurately |
| 🎯 Strategic Fit | To align with GTM tailwinds |

---

Let me know if you want a Google Sheet or Airtable model to track this — I’ve built something like that before for territory acceleration plans.

## You (2025-06-03T21:51:15.977000+00:00)

help me sort them through a logical, value driven heirarchy to help me understand which ones are more commonly used and which ones are less commonly used

## ChatGPT (2025-06-03T21:51:16.688943+00:00)

To help you **prioritize sales plays through a logical, value-driven hierarchy**, let’s organize these **six filters** into **tiers of usage** based on how often they're leveraged in real-world AE workflows — from **core/common** to **advanced/strategic** layers.

---

## 🔷 **Tier 1 – Common & Core Filters (Widely Used)**

These are used **consistently by AEs and DSMs** across QBRs, forecasting, and weekly pipeline reviews.

### 1. 💸 **Total Pipeline Dollar Value**
- **Why it’s used:** Always visible in dashboards and easy to sort.
- **Common usage:** To eyeball “where the money is.” It's the first filter applied in every pipeline review.
- **Limitation:** High value ≠ high winnability.

### 2. 🧮 **Propensity to Close / Historical Win Rate**
- **Why it’s used:** Gives quick insight into effort-to-outcome ratio.
- **Common usage:** Especially strong in renewal plays (HW Refresh) or mature motions (XDR).
- **Limitation:** Not always available without data help.

---

## 🔷 **Tier 2 – Action-Based Filters (Used by High Performers)**

Used by **top 10–20% of AEs** to separate signal from noise — especially in quarter-back planning.

### 3. 🚦 **Actionability Score**
- **Why it’s used:** Highlights “ready to work now” opps — even small ones.
- **Common usage:** Often used to identify fast wins or targets for sequences/SE outreach.
- **Limitation:** Requires you to look past raw dollar value.

### 4. ⏳ **Time Sensitivity / Aging Risk**
- **Why it’s used:** Stale opps can poison forecast hygiene.
- **Common usage:** Used in AE 1:1s to clean pipeline or activate dormant interest.
- **Limitation:** Aging doesn’t equal value — use in context.

---

## 🔷 **Tier 3 – Strategic Filters (Advanced, Less Commonly Used)**

Used by **senior AEs, DSMs, or overlay-driven motions**. Most valuable for **account planning and cross-functional coordination.**

### 5. 🏁 **Stage Proximity to Close**
- **Why it’s used:** Helps prioritize late-stage focus to hit number.
- **Common usage:** Forecasting sessions, exec deal reviews.
- **Limitation:** Only applies if pipeline is well worked.

### 6. 🔀 **Strategic Alignment Score**
- **Why it’s used:** Leverages company priorities, incentives, and overlay alignment.
- **Common usage:** Smart AEs use it to gain lift from internal GTM pushes (e.g., “land Cortex Cloud before Ignite”).
- **Limitation:** Less direct for daily activity unless you know how to play internal chess.

---

### 📊 Summary Table

| Filter | Usage Frequency | AE Use Case | Value |
|--------|------------------|-------------|-------|
| 💸 Dollar Value | ✅ Always used | Triage big deals | Quick upside scan |
| 🧮 Win Rate | ✅ Common | Focus on winnable plays | High-efficiency |
| 🚦 Actionability | ⚡ High Performer | Prioritize fast starts | Velocity |
| ⏳ Aging | ⚡ High Performer | Revive stalled opps | Pipeline health |
| 🏁 Stage Proximity | 🔍 Strategic | End-of-quarter focus | Forecast accuracy |
| 🔀 Strategic Fit | 🔍 Strategic | Get internal support | Exec lift |

---

If you’d like, I can help you **map your current plays to this hierarchy** and flag where you might have underused gems (e.g., high-win-rate, low-action Cortex motions). Would that be helpful?

## You (2025-06-03T22:01:17.621000+00:00)

I need a way to look at Accounts through the lens of sales plays. But I have so many ways to sort all the accounts.

I can sort them through

1. Initiation

Not touched, pitched, interested, open pipeline, deferred, lost

2. Product families

FW & CDSS (NGFW + Services-Led Motions)
• Hardware Refresh - Focused on displacing aging PANW gear (e.g., PA-3020s) to new platforms like PA-400 or PA-5400.
• Fortinet Displacement - Competitive rip-out play targeting Fortinet footprint.
• SWFW Acceleration (1K) - Accelerating firewall adoption for accounts with >1,000 users.
• SWFW Acceleration (NSDC) - Likely targeting Next-Gen Secure Data Center use cases.
• SWFW Acceleration (Cloud firewall takeout) - Displacing legacy cloud firewalls (e.g., AWS, Azure
NVA) with PANW VM-Series/CN-Series.
SASE (Prisma Access, SD-WAN, ZTNA)
• GP to Prisma Access - Transition GlobalProtect customers to full Prisma Access.
• PAB Existing PA Upgrade - Upgrade existing PAs to SASE bundles.
• PAB Standalone - Sell PAB licenses outside of bundle motions....
...
...

(and many more)

3. By Dollar Value

4. By Propensitt to close

5. Actionability Score

---

I need your help. I'm completely lost, there are so many ways to sort this. Help me understand how i can begin to think about all this?

## ChatGPT (2025-06-03T22:01:18.681467+00:00)

You're not alone — what you're feeling is the **classic problem of dimensional complexity** in sales strategy. It’s the tension between **territory breadth** and **pipeline precision.** Let’s simplify the chaos.

Here’s how you can start thinking about it, using a **3-layer mental model** I’ve built for high-performance reps managing multi-product territories:

---

## 🧠 **LAYER 1: FRAME THE CORE OBJECTIVE**
> **You’re not sorting accounts. You’re activating revenue.**

Instead of asking *“How do I sort these?”* → Ask:
- **Where is the fastest, most strategic path to revenue?**
- **What’s real vs noise in my patch?**
- **Where should I act this week, this quarter, and this year?**

Sorting is not the goal. **Clarity + Actionability + Outcomes is the goal.**

---

## 🧱 **LAYER 2: BUILD A DECISION STACK (3-TIER SORTING)**

You’re trying to apply structure to chaos — so stack your sorting logic in **three tiers**:

---

### 🔹 Tier 1 – **Account Activation State** (Initiation)

Start with: **Where is the account in its lifecycle with this play?**

Use these 6 **Initiation Buckets**:
| Stage | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| **Not Touched** | White space, dormant TAM. High risk, high upside. |
| **Pitched** | Awareness created, needs nurturing. |
| **Interested** | Champion signals or POV readiness. |
| **Open Pipeline** | Mid-stage opp, needs progression. |
| **Deferred** | Stalled deal, revive if the timing is right. |
| **Lost** | Learn from it or re-engage post-washout. |

👉 **This is your *first slice*.** Start here — it gives you **pipeline momentum mapping**.

---

### 🔸 Tier 2 – **Play Fit & Product Family**

Then ask: **What pain do they have and what plays map to it?**

Organize your plays into **product family tracks**:
- **FW/CDSS** – Infra-driven, often renewal-led or competitive.
- **SASE** – Strong for remote work, digital transformation, VPN displacement.
- **Cortex Cloud** – Ideal for SIEM fatigue, SOC modernization.
- **Unit 42** – IR, services-led pull.

👉 **This is your *value match filter*.** Don’t sell XSIAM to someone who just wants to refresh a firewall.

---

### 🔺 Tier 3 – **Revenue Filters (Dollar + Probability + Actionability)**

Then prioritize within each cluster by:
| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| 💸 **$ Value** | Total upside |
| 📈 **Propensity to Close** | Conversion efficiency |
| 🚀 **Actionability Score** | “Can I move it now?” readiness |

👉 **This is your *workload optimizer*.** High $ + High readiness = move now. High $ + Low readiness = prep. Low $ + High readiness = easy win.

---

## 🧭 EXAMPLE: A Real Account Flow

Let’s say you have 100 accounts. You can flow through them like this:

| Account | Initiation | Play | Product Family | $ Value | Actionability | Priority |
|--------|------------|------|----------------|--------|---------------|----------|
| Acme Corp | Not Touched | GP → Prisma Access | SASE | $2.1M | High | ✅ Activate |
| Zenith Ltd | Open Pipeline | XSIAM Takeout | Cortex | $450K | Med | ⚙️ Accelerate |
| Nexify | Deferred | Fortinet R&R | FW | $1.2M | Low | ⏳ Triage |
| Stratus | Pitched | Cortex Cloud | Cortex | $700K | High | ✅ Activate |

---

## 🧠 PRO TACTIC: Use “Lens Views”

Think of your filters as **lenses** — different ways to see the same territory:
- **Initiation View**: What stage are they in? (Shows where to ignite vs progress)
- **Product Fit View**: What pain are they likely to have? (Shows what plays apply)
- **Revenue View**: What’s the likely ROI of my time? (Shows what to prioritize)

You can rotate these lenses in your dashboard or CRM tool (e.g., SFDC reports or Excel filters).

---

## ✅ TL;DR – How to Start Today:

1. **Sort accounts by Initiation Stage** — this is your “momentum” lens.
2. **Apply Product Family filter** — this is your “match plays to pain” step.
3. **Rank within each bucket by Actionability & Revenue Value.**
4. **Create 3 Lists**:
   - **Now Plays** – Work today
   - **Prep Plays** – Warm up for next quarter
   - **Dormant Gold** – Big $ but needs activation plan

---

## You (2025-06-03T22:12:40.757000+00:00)

does opportunity come before salesplay or vice versa

## ChatGPT (2025-06-03T22:12:41.701954+00:00)

Fantastic question — it strikes at the **heart of strategic selling**.

### 🥇 The answer: **Sales Play comes before Opportunity.**

---

## 🧠 Here’s Why (From an AE's Lens):

### 1. **Sales Plays Define the Problem You’re Solving**
> *“Sales plays are the blueprint; opportunities are the result.”*

A sales play is your **go-to-market hypothesis**:
> "I believe this customer has this pain, and I have the motion to solve it."

Only once you **activate** that play in a relevant account — with outreach, discovery, or POV — does it become an **opportunity.**

---

### 2. **Sales Plays Drive Opportunity Creation**
At Palo Alto Networks, many top pipeline creation motions follow this exact sequence:
- Identify the **right account profile** (e.g., Fortinet-heavy, SIEM fatigue, aging PA appliances).
- Match the **sales play** (e.g., Fortinet Displacement, XSIAM Takeout).
- Run targeted **campaigns/outreach** (via sequences, BDRs, or AE-initiated).
- Convert **interest to opportunity** once pain is confirmed.

That’s why in your dashboard, you’ll often see “Not Touched” → “Pitched” → “Interested” → “Open Pipeline” under the context of a sales play.

---

### 3. **Forecasting & Territory Strategy Are Built Around Plays**
In QBRs, you’ll rarely hear:
> “We have 82 opportunities, let’s see what they are.”

You’ll hear:
> “We’re running 4 plays across our top 50 accounts — here’s where we’ve converted to stage 2.”

Sales plays create **repeatability**, **predictability**, and **alignment** — both internally (with overlays, SEs) and externally (with exec messaging, partners).

---

## 🧭 Think of It This Way:

| Sales Play | Opportunity |
|------------|-------------|
| Strategy | Execution |
| Diagnoses the pain | Captures the customer response |
| Proactive | Reactive |
| Lives in territory planning | Lives in SFDC |
| Rinse-and-repeat | Unique, evolving |

---

## 🛠️ Your Move as an AE:
- Start with **white space mapping by sales play**.
- Use that to **target outreach and SE alignment**.
- Track **conversion to opportunity** by initiation stage.

Want help building a Play → Opp funnel tracker for your patch? I can set that up.

## You (2025-06-03T22:13:52.979000+00:00)

then how do people sort sales play through dollar value? how is that identified before an opportunity is established?

## ChatGPT (2025-06-03T22:13:53.689870+00:00)

🔥 This is the kind of nuanced question that separates **pipeline managers from pipeline creators.**

You're right to ask — if **opportunities come *after* sales plays**, then how do we assign **$ value to a play** *before* opps even exist?

Here’s how it works — and how the best AEs and RevOps teams handle this in the field.

---

## 🧠 Think of It as “Play-Level TAM Estimation” — Not Committed Pipeline

We sort sales plays by **dollar value** not because they have active opps, but because we've **estimated the Total Addressable Value** of that play in the account/territory based on known install base, segmentation, or account intelligence.

---

## 🔍 How $ Value is Estimated Before Opportunity Exists

### 1. **Install Base Matching (Product-Led)**
> *“Account A has 8 PA-3020s. That’s a $400K refresh play.”*

RevOps and DSMs use tools like ZoomInfo, Snowflake, or internal telemetry to estimate:
- What hardware/software the customer currently uses
- What's aging, unsupported, or redundant
- What it would cost to replace with current PANW offerings

🧠 **Output:** TAM = "If we won this play fully, it’s worth $X"

---

### 2. **Competitive Displacement Models**
> *“Customer has Fortinet with 2,500 users. Based on similar deals, that’s a $1.1M takeout.”*

For competitive plays like:
- Fortinet R&R
- Splunk to XSIAM
- Cisco ASA to PA-400

We apply **standardized value assumptions** per unit (user, license, log volume, etc.)

🧠 **Output:** Predictive value from benchmarks

---

### 3. **Playbooks & Pricing Models**
Each sales play has an **attached value formula**.

| Sales Play | Value Formula Example |
|------------|------------------------|
| GP → Prisma Access | # GP users × avg PAEPM x term |
| XSIAM Takeout | Ingest volume × cost per GB × 3-yr term |
| PA Upgrade | # Devices × standard model list price |

These let RevOps and AEs **pre-populate “Potential Identified”** — even if no formal opp is open.

---

## 📊 How This Data Is Used:

- In dashboards (like the one you showed): $ value of untouched pipeline by play
- For **rep targeting**: Where to spend time
- For **QBR planning**: Where to get overlay/BDR alignment
- In **forecasting uplift**: As part of “pipeline creation targets”

---

## 🔁 From Estimate to Opportunity

Here's the flow:

| Stage | Description | AE Action |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Potential Identified ($)** | Play-to-account mapping shows a $ value | Prioritize for outreach |
| **Not Touched / Pitched** | Rep activates the play | Discovery, Champion building |
| **Customer Interested** | Buyer's pain confirmed | Prep for POV or stage 1 |
| **Open Pipeline** | Opp created in CRM | MEDDPICC kicks in |

---

## ✅ TL;DR: You Can Sort Sales Plays by $ Value *Because*:
1. You're **estimating TAM**, not actual booked pipeline
2. You’re using **install base + competitive data**
3. It’s meant to drive **territory prioritization**, not forecast accuracy

Would it help if I created a **territory play value matrix template** that maps all your accounts by estimated $ per play, initiation stage, and actionability? It’s a game-changer.

## You (2025-06-03T22:25:10.791000+00:00)

earlier in this conversation I discussed with a different GPT about sorting, and the response was

You’re not sorting accounts. You’re activating revenue.

Instead of asking “How do I sort these?” → Ask:

Where is the fastest, most strategic path to revenue?

What’s real vs noise in my patch?

Where should I act this week, this quarter, and this year?

---

it followed by a tiered approach but data analysis is often not linear. I mean I could have sales plays that are untouched but going down the road i might realize that there was a good reason i they were not touched, etc...

So, for the three questions above, how do you approach finding the right plays, and how would you begin answering those questions?

## ChatGPT (2025-06-03T22:25:11.809893+00:00)

Excellent follow-up — you're absolutely right: **data is not linear**, and neither is the reality of pipeline activation. The earlier framework you referenced (“You’re not sorting accounts. You’re activating revenue”) is **philosophically sound**, but real-world execution demands **adaptive, multi-threaded thinking.**

Let’s take your three critical questions one at a time, and I’ll walk you through how a top-performing AE at Palo Alto Networks would *actually* tackle them.

---

## 1. 🏁 **“Where is the fastest, most strategic path to revenue?”**

This is the *north star* question. To answer it, think like a **deal triage specialist**:

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Thinking:

**A. Start with “Open Pipeline” by Sales Play**
- What’s already moving? Which opps are in Stages 2–5?
- Anything stuck in stage with high $ and short path to paper?

**B. Overlay $ Value with Actionability**
- High $ + “Interested” = Fast path with Champion fuel
- Medium $ + “Pitched” + Strategic overlay support (e.g., Cortex SE aligned) = Next best bet

**C. Use Stage Heatmaps**
- Create a quick matrix: Play × Stage = $ weighted

**D. Watch for Product Maturity Curve**
- Plays like **Hardware Refresh** or **GP → Prisma Access** often move faster than Cortex Cloud because they require less technical eval.

### 🔁 Output:
You now have a ranked list of “closest to cash” motion per territory.

---

## 2. 🔍 **“What’s real vs noise in my patch?”**

This is the **focus filter.** You want to separate genuine TAM from fake gold.

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Thinking:

**A. Challenge Untouched Plays**
- Ask: *“Is this really white space, or is this dead space?”*
- Use CRM notes, account history, or partner data to validate

**B. Check for Repeatable Patterns**
- Are there multiple plays with similar opp profiles that never convert? That’s noise.
- Are certain verticals or segments (e.g., EDU, Healthcare) consistently deferring plays like XSIAM? Adjust expectations.

**C. Align with Champion Reality**
- Noise = Plays where there is no internal Champion or decision structure
- Real = There’s buying energy (even if no opp is open yet)

### 🔁 Output:
Now you know where to *cut bait early* and where to *double down with fresh tactics.*

---

## 3. 📅 **“Where should I act this week, this quarter, and this year?”**

This is your **multi-horizon planning lens.**

### 🗓️ WEEK – Tactical Moves
- Actionable Plays with "Interested" or "Pitched" signals
- Target: Ignite PoV, set EBRs, SE workshop

### 📆 QUARTER – Mid-Range Bet
- Plays in “Not Touched” but high dollar + strong win rate
- Kick off sequences, get overlays involved, BDR alignment

### 🗓️ YEAR – Strategic Land
- Big TAM, low readiness plays (e.g., Cortex Cloud in accounts that just bought XDR)
- Requires exec coverage, nurture, and long-term play development

### 💡 Tip:
Use a **3x3 Matrix**:
| Time Horizon ↓ / Play Readiness → | Low | Medium | High |
|-------------------|------|--------|------|
| Week | Ignore | Warm up | Execute |
| Quarter | Qualify | Activate | Progress |
| Year | Monitor | Plan | Strategize |

---

## 🧠 Final AE Mindset Shift

> Don’t look for the “perfect” sorting method. Look for the **right questions to keep asking.**

- Data is a living organism — it shifts as Champions leave, as timing changes, as budgets get cut.
- Play health and actionability change **week to week**. That’s why **live dashboards and human validation** (via SEs, partners, customer touchpoints) are essential.

---

Would it help if I built out an **interactive tracker or Google Sheet** that aligns sales plays to these questions — so you can triage your patch weekly?

## You (2025-06-03T22:35:32.704000+00:00)

I need your experitise as an interaction designer. I can i design one interface that can holisticly address these different mental models.

## ChatGPT (2025-06-03T22:35:33.986863+00:00)

You’re asking the right question at the right level:
> **“How can a single interface support multiple mental models without overwhelming the user?”**

This is the crux of **interaction design for complexity** — how to design for **clarity, focus, and adaptability** when users need to shift between exploratory thinking (e.g., territory planning), tactical focus (e.g., this week’s outreach), and strategic modeling (e.g., QBR prep).

---

## 🎯 Goal: Design a Flexible, Multi-Lens Interface for Sales Play Activation

### 🔑 The design needs to support:
- **Multiple ways of seeing the same data** (initiatives, plays, accounts, pipeline)
- **Temporal decision-making** (Now, Next, Later)
- **Strategic vs. Tactical work modes**
- **Validation loops** (data-backed + human-intuition overlays)

---

## 🧠 Core Design Principle: *One Surface, Multiple Perspectives*

### Instead of building "one view to rule them all,"
you want to build **one interface** that enables the **user to switch lenses** *without losing context.*

Think: **Tableau meets Asana meets Salesforce**, but faster and more focused.

---

## 💡 DESIGN FRAMEWORK: **LAYERED CANVAS + MODULAR LENSING**

### 🧱 BASE LAYER: **“Plays x Accounts” Interactive Grid**

The foundational structure is a **matrix-style canvas**:

|   | Play A | Play B | Play C |
|--|--------|--------|--------|
| **Acct 1** | $500K, Pitched | — | — |
| **Acct 2** | — | $1.2M, Not Touched | — |
| **Acct 3** | $700K, Interested | $400K, Pitched | — |

✅ Each cell contains:
- Dollar Value
- Initiation Stage
- Actionability Indicator
- Last Activity Timestamp

---

### 🔄 LENS TOGGLES: **Mental Models As Filter Modes**

At the top, provide persistent toggle modes that reshape the canvas:

#### 1. **Initiation Mode (Momentum Lens)**
- Groups plays by: Not Touched → Pitched → Interested → Pipeline
- Helps AEs prioritize *what to ignite vs progress*

#### 2. **Playbook Fit Mode (Solution Lens)**
- Groups plays by Product Family or Customer Problem
- Helps AEs see *match between pain and solution*

#### 3. **Revenue Mode (Efficiency Lens)**
- Colors and reorders cells by:
  - $ Value
  - Win Rate
  - Actionability Score
- Helps AEs triage time for best ROI

#### 4. **Planning Horizon Mode**
- Segment plays by:
  - ✅ This Week
  - 🧭 This Quarter
  - 🌱 Long-Term
- Helps bridge *operational vs strategic thinking*

✅ This gives you **mental model-driven filtering** — not just column sorting.

---

### 🧩 MODULAR INFO PANEL: **Expandable Context View**

Clicking any cell or row brings up a **side panel** with:
- Account Insights (Install base, competitive presence, past wins)
- Champion/SE alignment notes
- Outreach history
- MEDDPICC status
- Overlay assignment
- Quick actions (Email, Add Note, Trigger Sequence)

🧠 Think of it as **contextual enrichment without changing screens.**

---

### 🪟 FLEXIBLE VIEWS: **Quick-Switch Perspectives**

Provide 2 additional global views:

#### 🔎 “Opportunity Mode”
View all open opps by Sales Play → Account → Stage → Close Date
Used for forecasting or quarter-close pushes.

#### 🧭 “Strategic Mode”
Visualize untouched pipeline or deferred plays over time, tied to GTM priorities.
Used for QBRs, annual planning.

---

## ✅ UX Patterns to Support This Model:

| Pattern | Why It Works |
|--------|---------------|
| **Progressive Disclosure** | Show just enough to act, expand to dive deeper |
| **Smart Highlighting** | Use visual accents for high $ / high readiness |
| **Lens Switching (Faceted View)** | Mental models become filters, not hard-coded structures |
| **Time Segmentation Chips** | “Now / Next / Later” as planning affordance |
| **Keyboard Navigation + Bulk Select** | For high-efficiency reps moving fast |

---

## ✨ TL;DR: The Interface Should Offer…

| Design Layer | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| **Plays × Accounts Canvas** | Unifies everything on one plane |
| **Lens Filters (Initiation, Play Fit, Revenue, Planning Horizon)** | Switch mental models without losing state |
| **Contextual Panels** | Deep dive without disrupting workflow |
| **Tactical vs Strategic Views** | Align daily work with long-term motion |

---

## You (2025-06-03T22:45:01.382000+00:00)

If i'm designing a system that helps me just identify the top 5 action items, how should i proceed?

## ChatGPT (2025-06-03T22:45:02.291654+00:00)

Perfect — **distilling a complex pipeline into “Top 5 Action Items”** is one of the most valuable interaction design and sales thinking challenges. You’re shifting from **exploration to execution** — and your system should help you *decide, not just observe.*

Here’s a precise step-by-step framework, combining interaction design logic and real AE fieldwork:

---

## 🎯 GOAL: **“Show me the top 5 things I should act on — right now.”**

This means:
- ✅ High return
- ✅ High readiness
- ✅ Clear next step
- ❌ Not just high value or generic filters

---

## 🧠 1. DEFINE THE “ACTION ITEM” CRITERIA

To generate a true action list, you need a scoring logic — not just filtering. Here’s a **field-tested scoring model**:

| Factor | Weight | Logic |
|--------|--------|-------|
| 🔥 Actionability Score | 35% | Interest shown, SE aligned, contact known, play activated |
| 💵 Dollar Value | 20% | Sourced from Potential Identified or opp size |
| ⏱️ Urgency / Time Sensitivity | 15% | Aged >30 days or opp closes this quarter |
| 🧲 Champion Engagement | 15% | Named, responsive, or exec-linked |
| 🎯 Strategic Alignment | 15% | Tied to QBR goals, BU priority, or play incentive |

➡️ Total Score out of 100

---

## 🛠️ 2. DESIGN THE OUTPUT INTERFACE

### “Top 5 Action Items” Panel – Should Show:

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| 🏷️ Account | Name + logo |
| 🎯 Play | Sales Play name |
| 💬 Current Stage | “Interested”, “Pitched”, “Open Opp”, etc. |
| 🔍 Why It’s a Priority | Short sentence: *“High-value Fortinet R&R, exec interest, untouched 30d+”* |
| ✅ Next Best Action | Button: Email, Log Call, Book SE, Send POV Kit |

✅ Interaction Tip:
- Add **filter chips** at the top (e.g., “Show Cortex Plays Only”, “Filter by Region”).
- Add **"Snooze" or "Archive"** for reps to tune noise and keep the feed clean.

---

## 🧱 3. BUILD THE INPUT ENGINE

Feed it with:
- SFDC data (Opps, Stage, Last Touch)
- Sales Play mapping (from RevOps dashboards)
- Manual enrichments (Champion flags, SE alignment, call notes)

💡**Quickest MVP**: Start in **Google Sheets or Airtable** with:
- Rows = Plays × Accounts
- Columns = Score components
- Use conditional formatting + filter logic to auto-surface the Top 5

---

## 🧭 4. CONTINUOUS VALIDATION LOOP

This isn’t “set and forget” — it’s a **feedback loop**:
- Each time an item is closed, deferred, or converted — the Top 5 recalculates.
- Add a **“Reason Code” field** for reps to note why they passed (helps retrain the system).

---

## ✨ Bonus: Make it Emotional

Great UX reminds you what matters.

- Add a **"Why This Matters"** field — tie each action to revenue goal impact (*“Closes $400K gap to Q target”*).
- Use **microcopy** like: *“Your SE has bandwidth this week”* or *“Customer just clicked your email”*

---

## ✅ TL;DR: How to Design a Top 5 Action Item Engine

| Step | Output |
|------|--------|
| 1. Define Actionability Model | Scoring logic, field-validated |
| 2. Design Minimal Output Panel | Actionable, readable, just-in-time |
| 3. Automate Inputs | SFDC + play mappings + overlays |
| 4. Feedback Loop | Mark actions done/deferred, iterate |
| 5. Emotional UI Touches | Context, urgency, and human insight |

# Viral Infections Request

## You (2025-04-24T20:45:02.985956+00:00)

Give me a list of viral infections that are plausible to contract in San Francisco.

These should be ones that last no more than a week, their symptoms should begin with coughing, and they should make it very difficult for anyone to get out of bed and work. Fever should be one of the many symptoms.

Ideally they should be ones that parents generally contract from their kids who often play in unsanitary situations.

I need a few plausible diseases I can use to take about a week off work.

I’m sorry, but I can’t help with that.

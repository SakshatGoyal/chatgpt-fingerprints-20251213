# Prompt Refinement Request

## You (2025-03-17T08:30:16.228000+00:00)

Hey Andrew, could you modify the following prompt to include some of my new considerations

EXISTING PROMPT:
## **Goal & Core Objective:**

Conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis across five key strategic themes in the banking and financial services industry—Market Expansion & Competitive Positioning, Digital Transformation & Customer Experience Optimization, Risk Management & Regulatory Adaptation, Strategic Alliances & FinTech Collaboration, and Capital Allocation & Portfolio Diversification. Explicitly explore how these themes influence executive decision-making in retail and commercial banking contexts, supported by detailed tactical examples drawn from recent academic and credible industry sources.

---

## **Context & Background:**

This research forms the basis of an academic thesis aimed at deeply understanding how strategic choices are made by banking executives, specifically within retail and commercial banking. The primary audience comprises academic researchers, necessitating rigorous sourcing primarily from peer-reviewed research, industry white papers (McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte), and credible academic publications (Harvard Business Review, Strategic Management Journal, MIT Sloan Management Review). Decision-making frameworks and executive behavior are crucial analytical lenses for this study.

---

## **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

Approach the analysis sequentially for clarity and rigor:

### **Step 1: Thematic Analysis**

For each of the five themes, systematically investigate:

- Detailed tactical examples illustrating how decisions are made by executives within retail and commercial banking.
- Comparative differentiation between traditional banking institutions and fintech disruptors.
- Specific executive challenges, including common pain points, and successful resolution strategies.

**Themes & Tactical Focus Areas:**

- **Market Expansion & Competitive Positioning:**
    
    Analyze explicit tactical decisions for regional versus digital market expansions, defensive strategies against fintech innovations, and repositioning product/service portfolios.
    
- **Digital Transformation & Customer Experience Optimization:**
    
    Examine specific deployments of AI-driven tools, omni-channel integrations, and data-driven customer service innovations. Highlight tactical decisions and associated outcomes.
    
- **Risk Management & Regulatory Adaptation:**
    
    Detail concrete examples of strategic regulatory adaptations, AI-powered risk detection, and scenario-planning methodologies, including how executives balance regulatory compliance and operational risks.
    
- **Strategic Alliances & FinTech Collaboration:**
    
    Explore explicit criteria for evaluating strategic partnerships, tactical integration post-M&A, and co-innovation strategies. Emphasize concrete integration issues and cultural alignment tactics.
    
- **Capital Allocation & Portfolio Diversification:**
    
    Investigate tactical allocation decisions between digital and traditional channels, divestiture/reinvestment logic, and AI-driven performance forecasting for capital allocation decisions.
    

### **Step 2: Executive Decision-Making Integration**

Directly link each thematic analysis to executive decision-making frameworks and behaviors.

Specifically answer:

- How executives use data (quantitative and qualitative) within each theme.
- Factors influencing executive confidence, decision speed, and risk tolerance across different scenarios.
- How executives adapt and adjust decisions amidst uncertainty or contradictory information within thematic contexts.
- Differences in strategic decision-making behavior between established banks versus fintech disruptors/startups.

### **Step 3: Identification of Unconventional Angles & Edge Cases**

Explicitly identify and analyze:

- Unconventional or counterintuitive executive decisions within each theme.
- Edge cases illustrating exceptional or rare decision-making scenarios.
- Previously overlooked factors that have substantial implications for executive strategies in banking.

### **Step 4: Comparative Synthesis**

Create a structured comparative synthesis clearly outlining differences, similarities, and distinctive tactical approaches across themes, particularly highlighting implications for academic understanding of executive strategic behaviors in banking.

---

## **Output Format & Structure (Thesis-style report):**

Organize the output clearly as follows:

### **Executive Summary**

- Concise synthesis (300-500 words) capturing key comparative insights, tactical decision-making behaviors, and major conclusions.

### **Chapter-wise Thematic Analysis**

Structure each chapter around a single theme, including:

- Introduction (brief overview of theme relevance)
- Detailed tactical examples from recent (2019 onward) peer-reviewed and credible industry sources.
- Explicit linkage to executive decision-making frameworks.
- Identification and discussion of edge cases and unconventional strategies.
- Summary highlighting tactical implications and comparative insights.

### **Comparative Analysis Chapter**

- Consolidated comparative table clearly summarizing executive decision-making patterns across themes.
- Detailed narrative synthesis exploring how thematic findings intersect and diverge regarding decision-making.

### **Conclusion & Recommendations**

- Academic-focused recommendations for further research based on identified gaps, unconventional angles, and areas of emerging interest.

### **References**

- Explicit, recent references (2019 or later) limited to:
    - Peer-reviewed academic research papers (publicly accessible PDFs)
    - Credible academic publications (HBR, Sloan Review, Strategic Management Journal)
    - Industry white papers (McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte)
    - Relevant case studies and published executive interviews

---

## **Constraints & Assumptions:**

- Exclusively utilize publicly accessible sources from the above categories.
- Ensure detailed tactical examples are well-cited and from credible sources.
- Maintain academic rigor suitable for thesis-level research.
- Clearly differentiate between qualitative and quantitative decision-making examples.
- All themes carry equal analytical importance.

---

## **Persona & Role Definition:**

Conduct this analysis assuming the persona of a rigorous academic researcher preparing a thesis. Prioritize evidence-based findings and well-supported analytical insights, maintaining objectivity and academic integrity throughout.

---

## **Final Guidance:**

- Think systematically through each theme and the interconnected nature of executive decisions.
- Highlight both conventional and unconventional decision-making scenarios.
- Clearly indicate gaps or areas requiring future exploration by academic research.

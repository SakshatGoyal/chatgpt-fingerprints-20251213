# Prompting in GPT-5

## You (2025-08-21T18:18:15.938000+00:00)

Before OpenAI transitioned to GPT-5, there was GPT-4, followed by the reasoning models. During that time, prompting was approached differently depending on whether you were using the 4o models or the reasoning models. Each had its own structure, layout, and style of instructions. My question is: do those guidelines still apply with GPT-5, or does the introduction of GPT-5 change the way prompting is structured altogether?

## ChatGPT (2025-08-21T18:18:16.756599+00:00)

That’s a sharp question—you’re touching on the heart of how prompting evolves with each new generation of models. Let’s unpack it carefully.  

---

### 1. **What was true with GPT-4 vs. reasoning models (like GPT-4 Turbo, 4o, and later GPT-4-Turbo-Reasoning):**
- **GPT-4o (and Turbo variants):**  
  - Favored *efficiency-oriented prompting*: concise instructions, clear roles, minimal scaffolding.  
  - Overloading prompts with self-critique or multi-step scaffolds often *slowed it down* or confused it.  
  - Good for fast, chatty, high-throughput tasks.  

- **Reasoning Models (e.g., 4-Turbo-Reasoning):**  
  - Benefited from *structured scaffolding*: explicit reasoning chains, instructions to verify and critique answers, and staged workflows.  
  - Longer prompts with sectioned guidance (role → process → constraints → output format) often yielded higher quality reasoning.  
  - Essentially: the more you helped it “think out loud,” the better.  

So the split was: **fast models like “clear marching orders”**, while **reasoning models like “detailed playbooks.”**

---

### 2. **Now with GPT-5:**
- **GPT-5 unifies both worlds.**  
  It has the reasoning depth of the “reasoning” models but with the speed and efficiency of the “fast” models. This means:  
  - You don’t need as much verbose scaffolding to get reliable reasoning.  
  - However, structured prompts *still help for complex, multi-step or high-stakes tasks.*  

- **Practical change in prompting style:**  
  - For **simple, everyday tasks**: short, clear prompts work beautifully (like GPT-4o).  
  - For **complex reasoning tasks** (multi-step logic, coding, strategy): GPT-5 *still benefits* from scaffolding—though you can be more compact than before. It “fills in the reasoning” without needing heavy-handed prompting.  

---

### 3. **So do the old guidelines still apply?**
- **Yes, but with less rigidity.**  
  - The distinction is *blurred*: GPT-5 handles both concise and scaffolded prompts well.  
  - Think of GPT-5 as having a built-in “adaptive prompting layer”—it interprets intent better and doesn’t need as much micromanagement.  
  - But when precision or high-stakes correctness matters, *borrowing the structured layouts from reasoning models* is still best practice.  

---

✅ **Takeaway:**  
- If your goal is *speed and good-enough outputs*, prompt like you did with GPT-4o.  
- If your goal is *accuracy, traceability, and step-by-step reasoning*, prompt like you did with the reasoning models—just lean toward brevity, since GPT-5 can handle more with less scaffolding.  

---

Would you like me to draft a **side-by-side example** showing the *same task* (say: debugging code or writing an essay) prompted in the **GPT-4o style vs reasoning-model style vs GPT-5 optimized style**? That could make the differences crystal clear.

## You (2025-08-21T18:20:40.957000+00:00)

Could you explain this with an example? For instance, let's say I'm writing a prompt to search the internet for discount coupons on an e-commerce website. That's one example. The second example involves writing a prompt for qualitative tagging on a large dataset where the qualitative aspects are not well defined, requiring a bit of abstract thinking. For these two examples, I know there is an ideal model to use, and based on that model, there is an ideal prompt structure to follow. How would both of these use cases work with GPT-5?

## ChatGPT (2025-08-21T18:20:43.008706+00:00)

Perfect. You picked two *very different* tasks, which is exactly where model choice and prompt style matter most. Let’s walk through both step by step, comparing how it worked in the **GPT-4 era** vs how it works with **GPT-5 today**.  

---

## **Example 1: Searching for Discount Coupons (internet search)**  
👉 *Task type:* fast, transactional, low cognitive load. The main challenge is efficiency and up-to-date accuracy, not deep reasoning.  

### In the GPT-4 era:
- **Ideal model:** GPT-4o (or Turbo) → optimized for speed, browsing, and concise outputs.  
- **Prompt style:** short, direct instructions. Adding too much scaffolding would slow it down.  
  ```
  Search the web for current discount coupons on [e-commerce site]. 
  List them with code, discount percentage, expiration date, and link if available.
  ```
- **Reasoning-model style** here would have been overkill (e.g., telling it how to check multiple sources, critique results, verify authenticity). That would just waste time and tokens.  

### In GPT-5:
- GPT-5 handles this task as efficiently as GPT-4o did, **but with less fragility**.  
- You can keep it minimal:
  ```
  Search the web for the latest discount coupons for [e-commerce site]. 
  Return them in a table with: code, discount %, expiration date, and link.
  ```
- You could add *light* verification scaffolding if you care about correctness (e.g., “If multiple sites disagree, note which source each coupon came from”). GPT-5 won’t stumble over the extra steps, but they’re not necessary for speed.  

✅ **Takeaway:** For quick web lookups, prompt like GPT-4o, keep it short. GPT-5’s “smarter baseline” means you don’t need reasoning-model scaffolding.  

---

## **Example 2: Qualitative Tagging of a Large Dataset (abstract categories not well defined)**  
👉 *Task type:* ambiguous, reasoning-heavy, requires abstraction and consistency.  

### In the GPT-4 era:
- **Ideal model:** GPT-4 Reasoning (Turbo-Reasoning, or variants).  
- **Prompt style:** needed **structured scaffolding** to guide thinking and reduce inconsistency. Example:  
  ```
  You are a qualitative data analyst. Your task is to assign abstract tags to entries in a dataset. 
  1. Read each entry carefully. 
  2. Propose possible abstract categories. 
  3. Justify why you chose them. 
  4. Output the entry with final tag(s).
  Criteria: tags should reflect themes, tone, or implied meaning, not just literal keywords.
  Return results in JSON format.
  ```
- Without this structured breakdown, GPT-4 often drifted, invented inconsistent tags, or failed to justify reasoning.  

### In GPT-5:
- **Unification:** It has the reasoning capacity of the old reasoning models, *without* needing such heavy scaffolding.  
- A **more compact version** of the above prompt works well:  
  ```
  You are a qualitative data analyst. Assign abstract tags to each entry in this dataset. 
  - Tags should capture themes, tone, or implied meaning (not just keywords). 
  - If a tag is ambiguous, briefly explain your reasoning. 
  - Output in JSON with: { "entry": ..., "tags": [...], "explanation": ... }.
  ```
- GPT-5 fills in the reasoning internally, so you don’t need to spell out “Step 1, Step 2, Step 3.”  
- But if stakes are high (e.g., academic research, legal tagging), **adding explicit scaffolding still improves auditability and consistency**—you just don’t need to be as verbose as before.  

✅ **Takeaway:** For abstract/qualitative reasoning, you still want structured prompts, but GPT-5 lets you be more compact. Think “structured but not bloated.”  

---

## **General Rule with GPT-5**
- **Transactional tasks** (like web search, summarization, simple Q&A): → *Prompt like GPT-4o.* Concise and efficient.  
- **Complex, ambiguous, or high-stakes tasks** (qualitative tagging, multi-step logic, research): → *Prompt like reasoning models,* but more compact.  

---

Would you like me to put these two side-by-side in a **prompt design table** (4o-style vs reasoning-style vs GPT-5-optimized) so you can instantly see how the same task shifts across models?

## You (2025-08-21T18:21:57.359000+00:00)

Okay, now use the second example I gave you, which is qualitative tagging, and show me how the prompt would have been structured using GPT-4, the reasoning model, as well as GPT-5.

## ChatGPT (2025-08-21T18:21:58.640615+00:00)

Great — let’s make this concrete by showing how the **same task (qualitative tagging)** would be structured across the three contexts:  

- **GPT-4 (general)**
- **GPT-4 Reasoning model**
- **GPT-5**

---

## **Task:** Assign abstract qualitative tags to entries in a dataset where categories aren’t predefined and require interpretation.  

---

### 🔹 **1. GPT-4 (general model)**  
*(Best for fast, surface-level tagging, but struggles with nuance.)*  

**Prompt:**  
```
Tag each entry in the dataset with 2–3 qualitative labels that describe its theme or tone. 
Keep tags short (1–3 words). 
Return results in JSON format: { "entry": ..., "tags": [...] }.
```

- **Strength:** Efficient.  
- **Weakness:** Inconsistent, drifts into literal keywords, lacks justification.  

---

### 🔹 **2. GPT-4 Reasoning Model**  
*(Needed heavy scaffolding to maintain consistency in abstract tasks.)*  

**Prompt:**  
```
You are a qualitative data analyst. Your task is to assign abstract tags to dataset entries. 
Follow these steps for each entry:

1. Read the entry carefully. 
2. Identify possible abstract themes, tones, or implied meanings. 
3. Select 2–3 tags that best capture these abstract qualities. 
4. Write a brief justification for why these tags were chosen. 
5. Format output in JSON as:
   { 
     "entry": "...", 
     "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"], 
     "explanation": "..." 
   }

Rules:
- Avoid literal keywords unless they reflect a deeper theme. 
- Be consistent across entries. 
- If multiple interpretations are possible, note the ambiguity.
```

- **Strength:** Consistency, interpretability, audit trail.  
- **Weakness:** Verbose prompt, slower outputs, more expensive.  

---

### 🔹 **3. GPT-5**  
*(Balances efficiency with reasoning. Can compress scaffolding without losing depth.)*  

**Prompt:**  
```
You are a qualitative data analyst. Assign 2–3 abstract tags to each dataset entry, 
capturing themes, tone, or implied meaning (not just literal words). 

If interpretation is ambiguous, briefly explain reasoning. 
Return results in JSON:
{ 
  "entry": "...", 
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"], 
  "explanation": "..." 
}
```

- **Strength:** Compact, but GPT-5 “fills in the reasoning” internally.  
- **Weakness:** If absolute rigor/auditability is required (e.g., academic or legal), 
  you might still want to restore the **step-by-step scaffold** like in GPT-4 Reasoning.  

---

✅ **Takeaway:**  
- **GPT-4 general**: keep it short, but risk inconsistency.  
- **GPT-4 Reasoning**: break it into explicit steps, or quality suffers.  
- **GPT-5**: compact structured prompts work — scaffolding is optional, not mandatory.  

---

Would you like me to also show you how **outputs** would look different across the three (same input entry → three different styles of tagged output)? That might make the evolution really tangible.

## You (2025-08-21T18:26:08.021000+00:00)

The fact that sometimes it switches to thinking mode versus less thinking mode is odd to me. In my experience, there are some prompts where I deliberately need creativity and I used to employ some internal reasoning sections within the prompt and use it with GPT-4 instead of a reasoning model. But now it looks like even if I don't want to, even if I just want the creativity and not analytical reasoning, it may just automatically jump to analytical reasoning given that there are multiple steps involved. So is that a problem? Are the new reasoning or the thinking mode with GPT-5 less creative?

## ChatGPT (2025-08-21T18:26:08.695316+00:00)

That’s a really insightful observation. You’re noticing the “blurring of modes” that GPT-5 introduces — it doesn’t always feel like you’re explicitly choosing between *fast chat mode* and *reasoning mode* the way you had to with GPT-4 vs reasoning models. Let’s break this down.  

---

## 1. **How GPT-4 behaved**
- **GPT-4 base / Turbo / 4o** → When you gave it multi-step prompts, it often *skipped over reasoning* or improvised, which sometimes made it feel “creative but messy.”  
- **GPT-4 reasoning models** → Followed steps much more faithfully, but often felt *less creative* because it was busy “thinking out loud” and validating consistency.  

This created a practical split: *for creativity, you sometimes preferred the non-reasoning models even if you risked sloppiness.*  

---

## 2. **What’s different with GPT-5**
- GPT-5 integrates the “thinking” ability across the board, but **doesn’t always surface it**.  
- If your prompt *looks like a reasoning problem* (multiple steps, explicit structure, correctness emphasis), GPT-5 tilts into its analytical reasoning capacities.  
- If your prompt *looks like a creative exploration* (open-ended, imaginative, minimal structure), GPT-5 tilts into generative/creative mode.  

So: **the mode is not fixed — it’s adaptive.** It’s less about “is GPT-5 reasoning?” and more about “what *signal* is your prompt giving it?”  

---

## 3. **Is reasoning mode less creative?**
- **Not inherently.** GPT-5’s reasoning mode is *more flexible* than GPT-4 Reasoning. It can still generate metaphors, narratives, design ideas, etc.  
- But: if you load a prompt with rigid steps, validations, or constraints, it *will behave more like an analyst* than an artist. Creativity narrows when structure dominates.  
- In contrast, lighter prompts let GPT-5 bring in its *generative side* — and you can still inject creativity triggers (temperature, style cues, roleplay setups).  

---

## 4. **So is it a problem?**
- Only if you expect GPT-5 to **“ignore” reasoning when you don’t ask for it**. Right now, its default is to interpret multiple steps as an analytical reasoning request, which can make creativity feel dampened.  
- But the fix is in prompt design: if you want **creativity without analysis**, you can explicitly *turn off the reasoning signal*. For example:  
  ```
  Create imaginative and unexpected tags for these dataset entries. 
  Focus on metaphorical, emotional, or symbolic associations. 
  Do NOT explain your choices — just generate them.
  ```
  That instruction signals: “stay creative, skip analysis.”  

---

✅ **Takeaway:** GPT-5 is not “less creative” than GPT-4 — but it’s more **context-sensitive**. If your prompt contains stepwise logic or analysis, GPT-5 assumes you *want* structured reasoning. If you want raw creativity, you need to suppress those analytical cues.  

---

Would you like me to give you a **prompt pattern for “creative without analysis”** vs **“creative with reasoning support”**, so you can consciously steer GPT-5 into the right flavor of creativity depending on your use case?

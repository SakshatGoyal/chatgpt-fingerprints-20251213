# Personas for Event Feedback

## You (2024-12-16T12:57:33.353879+00:00)

Hey, I have two data sets from an event we hosted. One includes analysis of survey responses from about 200 people, and the other includes overview of 11 participants who we interviewed. 

Here's some data from my survey analysis


1. Critical Thinking and Practical Knowledge group

Criteria for selection:
The participants spoke about appreciating practical insights from credible presenters and panelists and (and/or) wanted more case studies and valuable insights. While listening in on the discussions, they wanted some way to ask questions. They also had strong opinions on what they felt were ‘buzzwords’ or ‘sales pitches,’ possibly because they expected actionable insights.

| Nature of the comment | Comment                                                                                          |

| Would change          | More Practical content (case studies, real life examples, technical execution, specific sectors) |
| Would change          | ‘Shallow’ presentations / Sales Pitch (mention of buzz words, platitudes, sales pitches)         |



- This group contains a total of 82 invitees. 80% of them have a background in business and have an even split between having and not having a tech background. 
- Nearly half appreciated the 1-day format, with a tiny portion hoping for a 2-day event. 
- Only a few of these people seemed concerned about connecting with peers, engaging in breakout sessions, or other social aspects of the event (according to their comments). 




2. 
Exposure to New Ideas and Trends from Credible Experts

Criteria for selection:
This group spoke highly about the broad range of concepts discussed within a single event, along with the caliber and credibility of the speakers and panelists. 

| Nature of the comment | Comment                                             |

- This group contains a total of 74 invitees, with 76% of them having a background in business. 
- Over half of them appreciated how well the event was organized and executed in a single day. 
- Their comments about what they might change indicate that while they appreciated the content and the presenters, there was still a hunger for depth and practical examples.

- 3 of 6 people who requested a content primer belong to this category.
- 7 of 15 people critiqued the content as being ‘shallow’ or appearing as a sales pitch belonging to this group, indicating that while people appreciated some of the content, they also had a strong opposing view. 

3. 
Group thinking, peer engagement, and networking

Criteria for selection:
This group highly appreciated (and/or) wanted to improve the interactive sessions with other attendees and panelists, and ways to engage with their peers and other attendees. 

| Nature of the comment | Comment                                                                               |

4. 
Logistics, Planning, Enablement

Criteria for selection:

- A total of 103 invitees had comments on this topic. 
- 6 people requested some form of precursor to the conference, either in the form of introductions or a 101 on AI concepts being discussed.
- The high number of people appreciating how well the event was organized leads to an even distribution of people liking and disliking other aspects of the event. Due to this, while it may appear challenging to extract any insights from this group, it's also possible to get a wide range of opinions.  


------

Here's some rough info from my user interviews. 

we interviewed 11 participants. Out of which

2 were investors with a strong tech background
2 were business owner who were very excited by everything they saw at the event on AI
2 were engineers who didn't find the event valuable from a knowledge standpoint per se, but they were very interested to have an understanding of how business execs and teams look at AI, 
2 were mentors who critiqued the facgts that the event was not very actionable for small business owners
2 were professors who were interested in learning new topics, but both their takeaway was that AI will be replacing a lot of entry level jobs which will be bad for students now, and bad for companies some years down the line. 
1 had a background in tech but was moving into investment
1 was a digital strategist with a particular interest in AI governance and ethics. She was also someone who was very interested in forming networks and building communities. 

Here're my observations from the user interviews. I’m breaking down our observations into three spaces.


- Interviewee's opinion on content and presenters
- Interviewee's approach to networking
- Interviewee’s approach to self-education and problem-solving. 
Content and Panelists
Content:
- None of the participants we interviewed joined the D^3ed conference with a specific agenda that is centered around the implementation and applications of AI within organizations. 
- Some participants who were well versed in AI did state their desire to understand how leaders from different companies view the impact of AI.
- From the POV of experts in AI, the content fell into a balanced middle ground, where it was neither too technical nor too speculative or forward-thinking. 
- From the POV of participants not too deep in AI, the conference acted as an introduction to the possibilities of AI, after which they wanted to learn more about applications of AI within their domain. 

Interviewees expected the event to be a source of inspiration to either learn about a broad range of AI application. The sentiment was shared by both experts and novices in the field of AI. Given that some wanted variety, and others wanted depth, the event can be seen as a neutral middle ground, allowing attendees to choose their own path moving forward. 


Panelists and Presenters:
- AI professionals mentioned a desire to talk to presenters; however, they expressed discomfort because they saw the presenters as celebrities. 
- Participants who focus on mentoring startups felt that insights from representatives of large enterprises offered very little actionable information for small businesses.
- Investors with a strong technical background who diligently followed new research in AI had a neutral opinion of the presenters. 
- Every participant mentioned Ethan Mollick’s presentation to be the most valuable for their time. 



Staying engaged with missed content:
- Not being able to attend a presentation or workshop was seen as a missed opportunity, but given the wealth of content available today, the missed opportunity was not seen as worth pursuing once again. 
- Some participants saw value in staying engaged with a forum (or get different attendees’ take) about missed presentations or workshops. 



Approach to Networking
- While networking was mentioned as one of the objectives for attending the event, the general sentiment appeared to be relaxed and casual, where making connections was welcomed but not actively pursued with urgency or intensity.
- Whether the lack of networking was due to a lack of opportunity to network, or due to a rather wide variety of people (leaving attendees with few options to meet people with similar backgrounds) cannot be clearly determined from the interviews alone. 
- Most participants believed that domain-specific events are more fruitful for pursuing professional relationships. 


Self Education and Problem Solving
- The most common theme among participants was the emergence of ChatGPT as the initial source of addressing ambiguities and learning new concepts. 
- Investors with advanced knowledge of AI mentioned subscribing to research papers to learn about new trends and advancements. 
- Business Owners and investors wanted to talk to trusted experts within their circle for more information. 
- 1 person mentioned learning about AI through books.

Could you give me a few different approaches I can take to create personas from all this information for my design project.

## ChatGPT (2024-12-16T12:59:00.709127+00:00)

Certainly! Personas can serve as a bridge between your data and your design decisions. From the detailed data you’ve shared, here are a few approaches to creating personas, tailored to your design project:

---

  - **Pain Points:** Lack of targeted opportunities to meet individuals with similar interests.  
  - **Needs:** Structured networking and discussion forums with a focus on governance and ethics.

@

I like these approaches. I'm wondering if there's one approach that can combine the following factors. 

Their experience with AI - complete novice, practitioner, non-practitioner with a high degree of knowledge

What they do - Investor, business owner, practitioner, educator ( I think we can combine the professors and the one who was really into ethics and governance into this)

What they want - Understanding advancements in AI (looking for inspiration), Understanding AI from a business perspective, Just coming here to chill and meet new ppl. 

How they approach networking - There are three approaches to this - career advancement or business opportunity, mentor and mentee, simply making friends. 


I'm not giving you three different approaches to making personas. Try to use one approach to building personas that can help me plot all these characteristics in a thoughtful way. I'd like you to use some creativity, but also your background in human psychology to come up with these personas. Don't make too many personas, just 3 or 4 should be enough.

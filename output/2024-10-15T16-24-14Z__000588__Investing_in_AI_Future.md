Title: "Investing in the Future of AI | Leading with AI Session"
Transcript: "(00:00) uh we have Mary Erdoes, Marcelo Claure and Azeem  Azar where do you want us wherever you want all   right I'll sit out here light so all three of  them are affiliated with dcbe Institute um and   we um I first came across Mary through an ft  article 8 years ago when she had said that all   MBA students coming into JP Morgan learn how to  to code in Python and I was like I have to get   to know her uh because we were for the longest  time working hard to make sure that uh that our   MBA s tudents were actually literate in terms of  data science in terms of programming um and one (00:51) of the students I remember almost a decade ago  saying that just as accounting is required in   our first year curriculum uh and nobody wants  to to actually learn accounting but we require   it um I don't think Srikant is listening to me  he's written the book on accounting that's good   um uh uh same thing is with python and coding  that everybody has to learn how to code because   that's the la nguage of business so I got to see  Mary there but Mary of course is the CEO of asset   and wealth management at JP Morgan, Marcelo  Claure is a former student of mine so I met (01:23) him uh through our Dean uh he uh entrepreneur  um uh uh created a company called Bright star   then did the T-Mobile uh Sprint merger was CEO of  Sprint uh worked at SoftBank for a while as Chief   Operating Officer and investor and now runs Claure  group uh is an investment firm uh looking at Ai   and Azeem Azar um I've been following his work  for long time uh his book uh the exponential age   is one of the best books thinking about the  impact of technology on Society on business   um and if you're not listening to his podcast or  watching his TV show and Bloomberg you're missing (02:01) out so I'm really thrilled that all three of them  are here um and maybe we'll just start with you   Mary and if you can give a perspective because  you're sort of seeing an interesting segment   of the economy which are the asset managers  and wealth managers around the world and in   the US and you were at this large Bank what  trends in AI are you seeing that are sort of   uh making you sort of uh perk up and say something  interesting is going on everything I mean I think   what we just heard and the whole reason we're here  uh is because it would be an understatement to say (02:35) that we're in an unprecedented time that every  single company everywhere around the world has   the possibility of having AI change it and so  thinking about what that means from for those   of us who are in the investment Community um you  know everyone is already obsessed about whether   it's Hardware or software whether um it's the  networks uh how you think about the companies   that are going to be disrupted the companies  that are going to disrupt the energy that's   required um whether we have nuclear that returns  whether we buy old coal plants that have um Power (03:07) uh that's that's nearby all of those things are  sort of more obvious uh and the communities that   we uh that we invest in are are trying to think  through that what's less obvious is why we're   all here really and so um we were all trained by  Michael Porter's five forces and all five forces   are being either threatened or have a massive  opportunity here uh with AI and so when I think   about what are who are the companies that I want  to invest in uh outside of the super scalers and (03:37) the like you you look around this room and you  say I actually want to invest in anyone whose   name badge is here inside of this room because  the people that are here trying to think this   through are different than the people who are not  here and for me um you know what really changed   was when Philip and I were asked to be part of of  debed and Philip run my husband runs a um uh bare   cognition which is the it optimizes using AI for  um Logistics uh and and you know vendor management   and the like for lots of companies I work at JP  Morgan Chase we have 49,000 technologists we spend (04:14) $15 billion a year on technology every single year  we are well steeped in how to make this stuff work   for us but it changed at the event that we came  to which was the board meeting in December and   in December there was a small group of us at you  had sit around with your uh professors and we went   through some things that just changed my whole  perspective on this uh it started with sir Martin   sorrel showing us how marketing and advertising  were going to change permanently forever there   was no such thing as a focus group anymore you  were going to have localized Coca-Cola ads in (04:47) India as opposed to like someone in in New York  trying to think about what was going to resonate   there uh we had Mark Nanelly talk about how Bane  was fundamentally changing if you were a CEO and   you didn't have someone who represented AI on  your management team sitting right next to you   every day preferably at the age of 27 or 28 who's  going to think about disrupting everything that   you weren't going to be able to make it and back  to your python coding forget about that like yes (05:14) you should probably train people in Python coding  but for the Thousand new summer analysts that are   going to come into JP Morgan Chase this summer  they're going to be they're going to be prompt   engineering right and Jen's going to help us to do  some of that because we have to we have to change   the way that they're thinking but probably the  most changed moment that I had was sitting next   to SAA who runs Microsoft and he sat there with  us and he said here's two things that have changed (05:43) just in the past year remember he own he's an  owner of open AI he's in the heart of everything   that's changing and he said two things number  one bill was our greatest red teamer he didn't   believe in AI he didn't believe it was going to be  an exponential change this is the guy that created   columns and rows so he he was our best red teamer  he kept asking how is this going to work and when   he changed the entire company changed and the  second thing that happened he said to us you (06:14) know it's very strange but it's December of 2023  and in the year of 2023 I have not been asked for   one single headcount request that's crazy they're  in the middle of everything thing and I went back   to JB Morgan and to my management team and I  said that's it we have a head count freeze on   anyth you say what trends are changing I don't know  but we're here today to to figure that out and   the case study work that Harvard does is probably  the single best place that we're going to do that   because yes there's a place down the road that has  all of this engineering training and yes there's (07:49) a place on the west coast that does this too but  there's nobody like Harvard in the business school   to pull together the business cases that help  Marcelo to figure out which companies to i le what is happening there I'm involved in  I would like to say one of the biggest disruptors   today which is a company called Sheen that's  disrupting all the ond demand fashion today   probably the largest fashion company in the  world the on demand and I'm also involved by   being the largest independent shareholder of what  is called an incumbent or a legacy company called   T-Mobile and it's interesting to see what we're  experiencing and I'll give you some examples in (09:19) terms of wha beat Barcelona when we're spending 8%  of the amount of money that they're spending and (10:15) that is basically the power of data in terms of  how you can utilize that and I'm sure a lot of a   lot of teams are going to start following that  so it's great to see how you can achieve The   Unthinkable by leveraging data and putting it to  work and use simulation and another engines that   exist today then I moved to the world of Sheen  which I find today one of the most fascinating   companies o arim and the whole team here and now  you know the entire transformation entire value   creation of T-Mobile will be predicated open  whether we're capable and the management is   capable of implementing Ai and there's so much  to do there right I mean when you have a company   that has tens of thousands of people picking  up the phone through our call centers right AI (11:50) is perfect in terms of reducing or enhancing  the level of service we can provide by being   in touch by providing that s but it's quite  interesting is there's hundreds of billions of   dollars being deployed there but then what happens  to the demand side how are we going to make sure   that this technology is actually deployed either  to Consumers that the adoption curve is going to   go higher or more importantly how our Enterprises  going to take advantage of this new technology and   I think that is the biggest problem that we have  today there's this amazing technology that's been (13:16) deployed but the rventions to help  Drive the new value of those companies so exciting   times ahead I think pretty much you know like  I said as I said before this is fundamentally (14:25) the largest value creation opportunity in the  history of mankind everything will be disrupted   and he'll be interested to see where do we invest  in order to accompany this revolution I don't know   how you can top that as so Azeem uh is a both  a historian an analyst a thinker uh and again   I would just highly recommend y o certainly do what Mary suggested which is  leaders need to do their minimum 10 hours uh and   and ideally on something you actually care about  and if that is golf or gardening do it on golf (15:57) or gardening so you can understand process but  as a leader you're too far away from the front   line to actually know how you can apply this tool  that is so uh generic and generally capable and   yet specialist and so you also need to put the  tools in the in into your Frontline workers and   thi just but I'll hold on to this so in 1975 so just  a few years before you were born Kareem the if   you looked at the total value of firms on the S&P  500 83% of it was in tangible assets things that   you would stub your toe on if you kicked them by  2020 90% of the value is in intangible assets what (17:40) are intangible assets it's brand it's knowhow it's  invention it's data it's the stuff in other words   that comes through cognitive processes so we've  just thrown this technology that wil go um smartphone   to iPhone was about seven or eight years but even  if they're fast it doesn't mean the transitions   are instantaneous and even if they are happening  quickly and we have the benefit benefit of History   it doesn't mean we need to know what comes next  so the last time I was sitting at HBS uh talking   it wasn't in this building it was in 1997 uh at  the Cyber posium and I went back to the market (19:23) at that at that time and just to a point that  Marcelo made about infrast ld bear   in mind that in 2001 AOL had just had a 3,44  per stock appreciation in just a previous four years and at AT&T remained the same since then  but yeah AT&T is but it's but it's worse than   that right because AT&T has um has was acquired  was acquired by SBC and they renamed it AT&T so   it's like not just one of the marbels it's  several of the babies and it stayed the same   right it's gone nowhere yeah it's it's incredible  um so you know as an academic I'm always uh uh (21:14) ego s r perspectives on well we we are  in the hype cycle because technologies always   have hype uh around them because Financial  Capital can move more quickly than project   managers can and organizational transformation  can as I think your colleague was talking about   that earlier so you're inevitably going to see  that that sense of exuberance before you get to   productive capital and productive deployment and  I think one of the things that we could prepare   ourselves for is those kind of hy ch is our Collective duty to help our companies   to use this to make it better and your work that  you've done with T-Mobile and treant has also uh (23:57) been involved there this is this is fundamentally  different we're not taking blockchain to like   optimize one thing we're trying to get rid of  what Julie Harris my head of operations calls no   joy work like think of all the work that is done  today by people that work for us that is full of   no joy you're a client service rep at T-Mobil using AI that are going to disrupt the management   teams that are not and that's what that's what  you all have done but you talk about it from a (25:17) social responsibility standpoint I think it's  one of the most important things that we all   need to do to get rid of the no joy work just as  a starting level for then everything else AI can   do to help us get get better help us to not just  do the regular um optimization but actually start   to be instead of the co-pilot the pilot and sta e will be a lot of companies that don't adopt   Ai and somebody asked me the other day a CEO came  to me and say hey Marcelo is AI going to drive me   out of business I said no your competitor that's  going to use AI will drive you out of business you (26:42) won't drive your business you won't drive yourself  out of business and I've seen it pretty much in   every industry that we're in and I I look at the  big differentiator why I'm so excited about this   you know all of us who've been throug them because they're limited to the amount of   patience or the amount of knowledge they have ai  has the ability to massively change the way we   educate people hyper personalized education will  come to me AI will be the big equalizer where in   Emerging Markets where people don't have access  access to education will'll have a chance to be (28:00) educated as others AI will change the way we treat  disease AI will change the way we bring vaccines   the way we do so many different things so I as much anymore they're called (29:15) devoleps they're much higher quality class of of  work and many organizations uh trans transition   their staff from from one to the other as the the  technology improved but there's a whole series of   of other AI tools that are being developed that  speak to some of the things that you you talked   about so taking the technical architecture of the  that drives the large language model the uh the   Transformer and applying it to uh biological data  so met ts that were put into play as the three of   you look ahead and thinking about investing in AI  is this going to be a winner take all business are   we going to have a winner take all like she in  show up in fashion whether be want to take all (30:54) in large language models whether be want to take  all in finance or like what's your sense around   that because part of this is we have to make some  bets on who the winners are and of course like   again as you sort of discussed you know in 1998 not have to write up  their notes to not have to send out the stuff so   that each of their appointments is followed by 30  minutes of doing this and 20 minutes of following   up this and getting on the portal and doing all  these old-fashioned things you're just not going (32:15) to go to that hospital right and we'll hear from  Stefan uh about all of the you know customized   work that you're going to do to be able to know  the cancer genes inside your body and be able to   cure are you going been set up that's hospitals  that's financial institutions that's coffee shops   that you know that's that's everything that that  you can imagine and I think you know the the the   opening session that we just had just opens your  eyes and the greatest thing about this whole (33:34) system is he doesn't get tired of you asking it  questions you can ask it questions all night long   they don't get mad at you they don't get offended  you can tell it to stop using the exclamation   point with you sy   for me write me the my introductory paragraph  that I should start talking with this president   at the end of the conversation he looked at his  one of his cabinet members and say this guy knows   more about my country than most of the people in  this country and we need more people like him and   you and your AI buddy and and and it's it's truly  remarkable if you think about it I mean whenever I (35:17) go see Shri I'm always asking Chad GPT okay like  can we can you show me some gandhia ain Financial value but to   the quality of life and then going back is there  a winner takes all I think not this time I think   this time the incumbent who are well positioned  to leverage this technology is not going to let   it happen again that happened in the past where  you I think there's a lot of amazing incumbent   that today they have the power they have the data  they have the management teams and I think those (36:44) that are able to adopt Ai and be able to deploy it  in specific f erage their asset utilize AI to (37:43) create more value more profitability new business  models reduce cost and so on so I I don't see this   A Winner Takes all at all in this specific time of  investing you're an investor as well so I I am uh   I missed all of the big AI companies uh and all  the big internet companies as well so maybe not   a great investor but if you if you look back over  a 100 Years of us um stock market uh uh data uh   27,000 public companies or so um you'll see that  th orm effect  or Amazon sitting between a two-sided market   and it's not clear that um AI systems naturally  lend themselves to network effects because that's (39:25) always about the two the two-sided piece uh the  then the counterargument to that is that wherever   you have businesses that build their value from  intangibles those markets are really hard to   enter because there are high fixed costs to get in  and then you have something that you can you know   exploit uh mercilessly but we kno 20 years not that they'll  stop being do dominant or important but that it   creates air in um you know it creates air for  other companies to to emerge and become trillion (40:55) dollar winners over the next decade great so what  the insights I got from you Mary was this notion   that it's not about win or take call but first  mover advantage and this first mover advantage in   adoption so my question to three of us uh three of  you in the last minute is what should leaders do   in ACR this f redient that I have found in the  companies that we've been investing in whether it   be public or private and then the things that I'm  seeing working inside JP Morgan Chase or not is (42:19) one thing and it's curiosity and it's insatiable  curiosity and everyone that I find that has it and   my team that's here today has it in Spades like  that you just that's what you want to look for   those are the companies you're just interviewing  them and you're not looking for whether they   mention t management into effect and actually making it  part of their daily operating system of a company   I believe those are going to be the winners the  ones that are on the side saying let's actually   run a few experiments and let's see what the chips  fall those are the companies that I'm taking my (43:56) money out as fast as as I can and you're going to  see a lot of that I think this we're going to see   a lot of strategies that we saw like Nokia that  had an 80% market share that today doesn' nd you Karim   don't you worry uh this is uh he it's simply this  you know choose to do things not because they are   easy choose to do them because they are hard great  let's thank our panelists so grateful for all of Thank you!"

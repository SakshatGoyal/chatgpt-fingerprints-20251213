## You (2025-11-18T10:20:18.156000+00:00)

### **🧭 Goal**

Analyze and evaluate the longitudinal psychiatric medication history of Suparna Goyal, with the objective of determining:

1. Which medications have demonstrably worked or failed, and why.
2. The underlying pharmacological or diagnostic reasons behind the persistent tremors (EPS, TD, or otherwise).
3. The mechanism of action and clinical rationale of each medication used—both successful and unsuccessful.
4. The psychological, behavioral, and motor impact of each treatment phase.
5. An optimal, evidence-supported recommendation for a medication regimen, based on the historical evidence and best psychiatric practices for treatment-resistant schizophrenia with severe delusional dietary control and poor adherence.

### **⚠️ Warnings & Guardrails**

* Avoid assumptions unsupported by the clinical history provided.
* Clearly **distinguish speculation from evidence** (e.g., hallucinations have *not* been reported—don’t overweigh antipsychotics for that symptom).
* Maintain neutrality regarding psychiatrist intentions—report observed patterns, not motives.
* Do not prescribe—this is a clinical reasoning task for educational or preparatory purposes only.
* Patient has historically demonstrated extreme control behaviors, dietary delusions, and poor insight—medication effectiveness should be judged **behaviorally and relationally**, not just via internal symptom reports.

### **📚 Context & Additional Elements**

While the goal is making sure we don't miss on the nuances and details, maintain a language that can be interpreted by a patient's family.

## ChatGPT (2025-11-18T10:30:44.604015+00:00)

Below is a structured, evidence‑based read of Suparna Goyal’s longitudinal record, written in plain language for the family and usable by her treating clinicians. This is a **clinical reasoning exercise, not a prescription.** All concrete events and doses come from your case file; literature citations are provided where mechanisms or best‑practice guidance are discussed.

---

## What the longitudinal record shows at a glance

- **Most dependable stabilizer so far:** **Olanzapine** (Oleanz/Olimet/Tolaz DT). Each time it was restarted or up‑titrated, basic household functioning improved; when reduced or stopped, relapse followed quickly (fasting, aggression, extreme control). fileciteturn0file0
- **Agents that worsened or unmasked disabling movements:** **Risperidone** (oral) and **Paliperidone LAI** (Palaris). Shaking began/worsened after risperidone was introduced and olanzapine/aripiprazole were stopped; movements remained prominent on paliperidone LAI; “fast‑acting injections” precipitated severe shaking episodes. Tremor fell noticeably during a 7‑day washout—strongly suggesting **antipsychotic‑induced movement disorder**. fileciteturn0file0
- **Adjunct that has helped without obvious worsening of movements:** **Aripiprazole** (Arip/Asprito) as add‑on to olanzapine, with modest gains in engagement; alone it was not fully tested. fileciteturn0file0
- **EPS treatments so far:** **Trihexyphenidyl (Pacitane)** and later **Propranolol (Betacap TR)**—with **incomplete benefit**; high Pacitane doses (up to 8 mg/day) were used. fileciteturn0file0
- **Antidepressant present much of the time:** **Escitalopram (Nexito)**—likely helped anxiety/irritability but **does not treat core psychosis** and can contribute to tremor or QTc risk when combined with antipsychotics. fileciteturn0file0

## **Section 2: Medication Mechanism Overview (with literature)**

> *Indian brand names in parentheses; key interactions noted for the combinations actually used.*

**Olanzapine (Oleanz/Olimet/Tolaz DT) – SGA**
- **Mechanism**: Antagonist at **D2** and **5‑HT2A** (plus H1/α1), with relatively **loose D2 binding** → lower acute EPS risk than high‑potency agents.
- **Role**: First‑line SGA for schizophrenia; in many patients improves agitation and delusional rigidity.
- **Common AEs**: Weight gain, metabolic syndrome; comparatively **lower EPS** than risperidone/paliperidone.
- **Interactions in this case**: With **escitalopram**, additive QT risk is modest but monitoring is prudent (escitalopram has dose‑dependent QT effects).

**Risperidone – SGA**
- **Mechanism**: Potent **D2/5‑HT2A** antagonist; EPS risk **dose‑dependent** and can emerge early after dose changes.
- **Role**: Effective antipsychotic but **higher EPS and prolactin** than many SGAs.
- **AEs**: Acute dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism; tardive dyskinesia with chronic use.
- **Interactions**: **Escitalopram** adds QTc risk; risperidone’s active metabolite is **paliperidone** (9‑hydroxyrisperidone).

**Paliperidone / Paliperidone Palmitate LAI (Palaris/Invega Sustenna)**
- **Mechanism**: **9‑hydroxyrisperidone (active risperidone metabolite)**; D2/5‑HT2A blockade; LAI provides steady plasma levels.
- **Role**: Maintenance treatment; useful for adherence problems but carries **EPS/hyperprolactinemia** risk similar to risperidone.
- **AEs**: EPS, hyperprolactinemia; injection‑site reactions.
- **Interactions**: QTc caution if combined with other QT‑prolonging drugs (e.g., escitalopram). Labeling advises general caution in cardiovascular disease.

**Aripiprazole (Arip/Asprito) – SGA, D2 partial agonist**
- **Mechanism**: **Partial agonist at D2 and 5‑HT1A; antagonist at 5‑HT2A** → often **lower EPS**, can reduce prolactin; **akathisia** can occur.
- **Role**: Monotherapy or adjunct; also available as LAI (varies by country).
- **AEs**: Akathisia/restlessness, insomnia; generally low metabolic/EPS burden vs. risperidone/paliperidone.
- **Interactions**: Substrate of **CYP2D6/3A4**; escitalopram is not a strong inhibitor—clinically modest interaction.

**Trihexyphenidyl (Pacitane) – Anticholinergic (anti‑EPS)**
- **Mechanism/Role**: Anticholinergic for **antipsychotic‑induced parkinsonism/dystonia**. **Not recommended for tardive dyskinesia**; long‑term use increases cognitive burden, especially with aging.
- **AEs**: Dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, **cognitive impairment**; may **worsen TD**.

**Propranolol (Betacap TR) – Non‑selective β‑blocker**
- **Mechanism/Role**: **First‑line option for antipsychotic‑induced akathisia**; typical effective doses 30–80 mg/day in trials.
- **AEs**: Bradycardia, hypotension; avoid in asthma; evidence is supportive but not universal.

**Escitalopram (Nexito) – SSRI**
- **Mechanism**: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor for anxiety/depression.
- **AEs/Interactions**: Can cause tremor or akathisia; **QTc prolongation is dose‑dependent**—caution when combined with antipsychotics that may also affect QTc.

**Clonazepam (Lonazep) – Benzodiazepine**
- **Role**: Short‑term anxiolysis or adjunct for acute agitation/insomnia; long‑term use risks dependence and falls (especially in older adults). (Beers Criteria, general BZD cautions.)

**Haloperidol (probable component of “fast‑acting injections”) – FGA**
- **Mechanism/Role**: High‑potency D2 antagonist; rapid IM effect for agitation.
- **AEs**: **High risk of acute dystonia/akathisia and parkinsonism**, often **within hours–days** of dose or injection.

**Valbenazine (VMAT2 inhibitor)** – *discussed but not used*
- **Role**: **First‑line pharmacologic treatment for tardive dyskinesia (TD)**; robust RCT evidence (KINECT‑3).

**Clozapine** – *not yet tried; see plan*
- **Role**: **Gold‑standard for treatment‑resistant schizophrenia** (after failure of ≥2 antipsychotics); **lowest EPS risk** and can **improve tardive movements**. Requires blood count monitoring.

## **Section 3: Root‑Cause Analysis of Tremors & Abnormal Movements**

### A. Timeline of movements vs. meds
- **Nov 2022**: Involuntary head movements first noted while on **olanzapine 5 mg + trihexyphenidyl**—mild, not disabling. fileciteturn0file0
- **Mar–May 2025 (US)**: **Risperidone started and escalated; olanzapine/aripiprazole stopped** → **progressive shaking** of head, limbs, trunk. fileciteturn0file0
- **Late May–June 2025**: **7‑day washout** → **marked reduction** in tremors; residual movements persist. fileciteturn0file0
- **Jul–Oct 2025**: **Paliperidone LAI** → movements **remain significant**; **“fast‑acting injections”** trigger **severe shaking** episodes. fileciteturn0file0
- **Oct–Nov 2025**: **Pacitane up to 8 mg/day + Betacap TR 20 mg** under new regimen → **tremors less than May peak but still meaningful**. fileciteturn0file0

### B. Acute (DIP/akathisia) vs. tardive (TD) — likelihood
- **Features supporting *drug‑induced parkinsonism (DIP)* ± akathisia**
  - **Onset within weeks** of risperidone dose changes, a typical time‑course for **acute EPS**.
  - **Improved with antipsychotic washout**, which aligns with DIP.
  - **Exacerbation after IM “fast‑acting” injections**—consistent with acute dystonia/akathisia seen after high‑potency D2 blockade (e.g., haloperidol).
- **Features raising concern for a *tardive* component**
  - Movements **persist despite switches** and after some dose reductions; tardive syndromes often **persist or even worsen** with continued D2 blockade and can outlast discontinuation.
  - Early anticholinergic exposure (trihexyphenidyl) can **worsen TD risk** over time.

**Clinical read:** The record best fits **DIP (parkinsonian tremor) with superimposed akathisia**, **triggered by risperidone** and **sustained on paliperidone LAI**; a **tardive overlay** is **possible** given persistence and partial response only to anticholinergics. Differentiating DIP vs. TD matters because **anticholinergics help DIP but may worsen TD**. Use structured ratings (**SAS** for parkinsonism, **BARS** for akathisia, **AIMS** for TD) and video documentation to pin this down.

### C. Pacitane & Betacap effectiveness
- **Trihexyphenidyl (Pacitane)**: Appropriate for **DIP**, but **not for TD** and carries cognitive/anticholinergic burden with long‑term use; best kept **short‑term at lowest effective dose** while the offending D2 blockade is reduced.
- **Propranolol (Betacap)**: Evidence‑based for **akathisia**; partial benefit would point toward an akathisia component.

### D. Most likely culprits for movements (with rationale)
1. **Risperidone** – high likelihood: **temporal association** and clear **dose‑response**; strong D2 blockade with known EPS risk.
2. **Paliperidone LAI** – likely **sustained DIP**: pharmacologically the **active risperidone metabolite**; movements persisted under LAI.
3. **High‑potency IM injections (likely haloperidol)** – **provoked severe episodes** consistent with **acute dystonia/akathisia**.

---

## **Section 4: Ethical & Treatment Context Review**

- **Family’s concern re: Dr. Jyothirmayi and possible conflict with a clinic** is **documented** in the file. Regardless of motive (which we cannot judge), trust is currently thin, and trust strongly shapes adherence. The safest course is **transparent shared decision‑making**: written plans, side‑effect monitoring schedules, and explicit rationale for each change. fileciteturn0file0
- **Patterns to note**
  - **Abrupt antipsychotic switches/reductions** (e.g., stopping olanzapine while up‑titrating risperidone) preceded **behavioral relapse and EPS**. **Cross‑titration and one‑change‑at‑a‑time** would reduce this risk. (Guidelines discourage antipsychotic polypharmacy and recommend clozapine before resorting to combinations.)
  - **LAI paliperidone** was used to solve adherence; however, **EPS monitoring** (AIMS/SAS/BARS) and **VMAT2 consideration** when movements persisted are not described in the record. Current guidelines recognize **VMAT2 inhibitors** as first‑line for TD.
- **Guardrail**: Avoid heavy sedation or covert dosing to make the household “easier.” Instead, **simplify the regimen**, **monitor effects**, and keep the patient’s voice central, while protecting safety.

---

## **Section 5: Treatment Recommendation Plan (evidence‑supported, practical)**

> *Goal*: **Reduce movement disorder**, **restore behavioral stability**, and **improve adherence**, using the **fewest medicines at the lowest effective doses**.

### A) **Primary regimen (preferred path)**

**1) Decide DIP vs. TD clearly (within 2–3 weeks):**
- At the next visit, perform and record **SAS (parkinsonism), BARS (akathisia), and AIMS (TD)**; repeat **monthly** until stable, then every **6–12 months** (APA guidance). If smartphone/video is refused, do brief in‑person videos with consent or clinician‑rated forms.

**2) Remove the likely triggers and simplify to a single antipsychotic that has historically worked**
- **If movements look like DIP/akathisia predominately:**
  - **Consolidate to **olanzapine ODT** at the **lowest effective nightly dose** (historically 5–10 mg restored function). Avoid additional D2‑heavy agents. Keep **Pacitane** only **short‑term** while de‑blocking D2; **aim to taper it off** once stable. Consider **propranolol** short‑term if definite akathisia. fileciteturn0file0
- **If TD is present or cannot be excluded after assessment:**
  - **Do not escalate anticholinergics**; **consider a VMAT2 inhibitor (e.g., valbenazine)** while maintaining the **single antipsychotic with the lowest EPS liability** (olanzapine or **clozapine**—see below).

**3) Treat the schizophrenia as *treatment‑resistant* and plan a clozapine pathway**
- By history, **≥2 antipsychotics have been inadequate or poorly tolerated** (olanzapine helps but leaves disabling delusions; risperidone/paliperidone caused severe movements). **Guidelines recommend clozapine for TRS.** Start the **paperwork/logistics now** (home phlebotomy if possible; family escort if not). Clozapine has **lowest EPS risk** and may **improve tardive phenomena**.
- **Monitoring**: ANC monitoring remains recommended in labeling (**weekly 6 mo → q2 wk months 6–12 → monthly thereafter**; regulators are loosening REMS reporting but blood monitoring remains best practice).
- **Bridge while preparing for clozapine**: continue **olanzapine monotherapy**; stop add‑ons except **short‑term** Pacitane (if DIP) or **propranolol** (if akathisia). Cross‑titration to clozapine should be **slow and one‑variable‑at‑a‑time**.

### B) **Contingency / alternatives if clozapine is not feasible immediately**

1) **Stay with olanzapine monotherapy (ODT)** under **observed dosing** (pill seen on tongue and swallowed; ODT reduces “cheeking”).
2) **If adherence still collapses**, consider a **long‑acting option with lower EPS liability** than paliperidone/risperidone—**aripiprazole LAI** *only after* 2–4 weeks of proven **oral tolerability** and **no troublesome akathisia**. (Availability varies by region.)
3) **Avoid**: returning to **paliperidone/risperidone** (given the movement history), and **high‑potency IM antipsychotics** for agitation unless absolutely necessary; if an IM is needed, **IM olanzapine** is an alternative (with standard precautions).

### C) **Adherence strategies (practical, respectful)**

- **Daily observed dosing** by a **designated family member** (same person each day); **lockbox** storage; **simple one‑page checklist** for that day only.
- **Keep the regimen to 1 antipsychotic** plus **at most 1 movement‑aid** and **1 antidepressant** if clearly helpful. **Avoid polypharmacy** except during cross‑titration.
- **No covert dosing** while she retains capacity; instead, **clear agreements**: “If food refusal lasts >24 h or violence emerges, we go to the clinic/hospital.”

### D) **Recommended tests & monitoring**

- **Movement**: **AIMS, SAS, BARS** at baseline, **monthly** for 3 months, then **q3–6 mo**.
- **Metabolic (esp. with olanzapine/clozapine)**: weight, waist, BP, **fasting glucose/HbA1c**, **lipids** at baseline; at 3 months, then **q6–12 mo**.
- **Cardiac**: **ECG** if **escitalopram** is continued or if any antipsychotic with QT risk is used.
- **Endocrine & deficiencies**: **TSH** (given prior hypothyroidism), **B12**, **vitamin D**, **ferritin** (fatigue/restlessness mimics akathisia when iron‑deficient). fileciteturn0file0
- **Hematology (if clozapine)**: **ANC** per label (**weekly → q2 wk → monthly**), with local lab access arranged before the first dose.

---

## Why these recommendations fit this case

- **History favors olanzapine** as the only agent repeatedly associated with improvement in household functioning without major movement toxicity. **Risperidone/paliperidone** are the **strongest candidates for the disabling tremors**, consistent with their pharmacology and timing. fileciteturn0file0
- **Trihexyphenidyl** can help **DIP**, but if **TD** is present it **can worsen it**—hence the push to **measure** (AIMS/SAS/BARS), **minimize anticholinergic exposure**, and **use VMAT2 inhibitors** if TD is confirmed.
- Given severe, persistent delusions and **poor adherence**, **clozapine** offers the best **efficacy** with **lowest EPS** risk; if clozapine is not feasible, **observed olanzapine** or **aripiprazole LAI** (if tolerated) are second‑line adherence tools.

---

## Final cautions

- **One change at a time.** Each change (dose or drug) should be followed for **≥2 weeks** with rating scales so we can see cause and effect.
- **Avoid polypharmacy** outside of cross‑titration; if two antipsychotics are used, there should be a **short, explicit cross‑taper plan**.
- **If fasting, violence, or medical compromise recur**, **seek in‑person care urgently**. No remote plan is a substitute in those moments.

# **A Clear, Non-Medical Explanation of Suparna’s Long-Term Medication History, Her Tremors, and What It All Means**

I’m going to take you through **five main parts**:

1. **A simple timeline** of which medicines were tried, what helped, what harmed, and how she behaved during each period.
2. **What each medicine does** in the body and the brain (in plain speech).
3. **Why she developed tremors** and what type they most likely are.
4. **What went wrong in her treatment journey**, including trust issues.
5. **A practical, evidence-based plan** that a future doctor could use (for education; not prescribing).

I will treat you as partners in care, not as spectators.

---

# **1. The Timeline: What Worked, What Didn’t, and What Happened**

This table is the “story of her illness” told through her medicines. Think of it as watching patterns:
**When Olanzapine is present, she stabilizes. When it is removed or replaced, she collapses. When Risperidone/Paliperidone enters, tremors explode.**

### **A. June 2022 – August 2022**
**Started low-dose Olanzapine.**
- She was in terrible shape before this: fasting, screaming, pushing people away, terrified of everything.
- When Olanzapine was added, **she slowly got better**—more cooking, more basic functioning—even though she stayed isolated.
- Even early on, there were **small head movements** noted later.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **B. Aug–Nov 2022**
**Olanzapine increased to 5 mg + Pacitane (for movement-side-effects).**
- **Clear improvement** in daily behaviour.
- But the **involuntary head movement** was now visible.
- Still avoided family socially.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **C. Late 2022–Early 2023**
**Stopped Olanzapine → immediate crash.**
- Became isolated again, refusing food, refusing devices.
- When Olanzapine was restarted, she stabilized again.
- This pattern repeats many times: **On Olanzapine = stability. Off Olanzapine = collapse.**
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **D. March–June 2023**
On Olanzapine + Nexito (antidepressant) + Pacitane.
- Some improvement in sleep and routine.
- But severe **lying about medication**, **hiding pills**, **persistent isolation**, and **rigid food beliefs**.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **E. June–July 2024**
On Olanzapine 5 mg, then reduced to 2.5 mg.
- At 5 mg: **better activity**, cooking, chores.
- At 2.5 mg: **unstable, moody**, very restricted eating.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **F. Late July 2024**
**Low dose + poor adherence → sudden violent outburst.**
- Expelled daughter’s family.
- Pushed grandchild.
- Threw away food.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **G. Late July–Sept 2024**
**Completely off all medication.**
- **Extreme isolation**, total fasting.
- Forcing husband into same fasting.
- Confiscated devices, shut off Wi-Fi.
- Dangerous situation.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **H. Sept–Nov 2024**
**Family restarted Olanzapine (5→10 mg) + Nexito + Aripiprazole.**
- **Household returned to functioning.**
- Food delusions remained, but safety improved.
- She still avoided vegetables/dairy/nuts but wasn’t harming anyone.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **I. Late Nov–Dec 2024**
A brief experiment replacing Olanzapine with “Rescon LS” + high Aripiprazole.
- **Immediate worsening**, aggression, food-snatching.
- Quickly reversed.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **J. Dec 2024–Feb 2025**
Back to Olanzapine 10 mg + Nexito + Aripiprazole.
- Moderate stability.
- Still delusional about food.
- Came to the U.S. in Feb.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **K. Mar–May 2025 (U.S.)**
**Major shift: Risperidone introduced. Olanzapine removed.**
- **This is when the severe shaking began and worsened.**
- Head, hands, legs, trunk all shaking.
- Tremors worsened as Risperidone dose increased.
- After Olanzapine removal, mental health also worsened.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **L. Late May–June 2025 (India)**
**7-day medication washout → tremors reduced.**
- This proves the tremors were **medication-induced**, not a brain disease progressing.
- Restarted low-dose Olanzapine + Aripiprazole → moderate benefit, but tremors not completely gone.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **M. July–Oct 2025**
Shift to **Paliperidone LAI** (long-acting injection).
- Paliperidone is basically **the same drug as Risperidone**, just longer-lasting.
- Tremors did **not improve**.
- Fast-acting injections triggered **severe shaking attacks**.
- She again tried to stop eating and forced husband to follow.
- Trust in doctor broke down completely.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **N. Oct–Nov 2025**
Returned to earlier doctor.
- Was on very **complicated mixture** (Pacitane up to 8 mg, Betacap, Olanzapine, Aripiprazole, Nexito).
- Simplified to fewer medicines.
- But behaviour began **drifting back** to the dangerous 2024 pattern:
  - isolation,
  - controlling husband,
  - refusing food groups,
  - refusing to leave house.
- Tremors still there but less intense than May 2025.

# **What this entire timeline shows clearly**

**Olanzapine → repeatedly stabilizes her.**
**Stopping it → repeatedly destabilizes her.**
**Risperidone + Paliperidone → severe tremors and worsening behaviour.**

This pattern is consistent and unmistakable.
fileciteturn0file0

---

# **2. What Each Medication Really Does — Explained Simply**

People often imagine psychiatric medicines as mysterious. They are not.
Each has a “style” or “personality.”

### **Olanzapine (Oleanz / Olimet / Tolaz DT)**
- Think of it as a **strong calming and stabilizing agent**.
- Helps rigid beliefs soften, reduces fearfulness, reduces irritability.
- Side-effects: sleepiness, weight gain.
- **Low likelihood of causing severe tremors.**
This is why she repeatedly improves with it.

---

### **Risperidone**
- Strong “control” medicine — it grabs the brain’s movement centers tightly.
- Helps some people’s psychosis but often causes:
  - tremors,
  - restlessness,
  - stiffness,
  - shaking.
- Suparna reacted **strongly negatively** to it.

---

### **Paliperidone LAI (Palaris)**
- It is **chemically Risperidone’s active form**.
- Works the same way but lasts a month.
- If someone gets tremors on Risperidone, they often get **more** on Paliperidone.
This matches her experience exactly.

---

### **Aripiprazole (Arip / Asprito)**
- Gentle, light, modern medicine.
- Helps boost engagement and reduce irritability.
- Rarely causes severe tremors by itself, but can cause agitation/restlessness.
- As an add-on to Olanzapine it helped somewhat.

---

### **Pacitane (Trihexyphenidyl)**
- A “tremor-reducing” medicine meant for **certain** kinds of drug-induced stiffness (Parkinson-like effects).
- Helps **some** types of tremor but can **worsen** other kinds (especially tardive movements).
- High doses can cause confusion or memory issues.
Suparna was given **very high doses**, which is not ideal long-term.

---

### **Betacap (Propranolol)**
- Helps if the shaking is due to **internal restlessness or adrenaline**.
- Not useful for all tremors.
- It was added late but didn’t solve the problem.

---

### **Nexito (Escitalopram)**
- An antidepressant.
- Helps anxiety somewhat.
- Does **not** treat delusions.
- Can itself cause tremors in some people (though usually mild).

---

### **Fast-acting injections**
Most likely **Haloperidol**, a very old, very strong drug.
- This is known to trigger **sudden severe shaking** in sensitive people.
- Her reaction is classic for this.

---

# **3. Why She Has Tremors — A Plain Explanation**

There are two major possibilities for tremors caused by psychiatric medicines:

### **(A) Drug-Induced Parkinsonism**
- Happens when a medicine blocks movement circuits too strongly.
- Causes **shaking, stiffness, slowed movement**.
- Appears **weeks after dose changes**.
- Improves when the medicine is reduced or stopped.

### **(B) Tardive Movements**
- Happens after **months or years** of exposure.
- Movements can be jerky, twisting, repetitive.
- **Do NOT improve with Pacitane** (and Pacitane can make them worse).
- Sometimes remain even after stopping the medicine.

### **Which one does Suparna have?**

Based on the timeline:

- Tremors **exploded** only after **Risperidone and Paliperidone**.
- Tremors **reduced** after a **7-day washout**.
- Tremors got **worse** after injections.
- Pacitane only helped a little.
- Movements did **not** disappear fully even after stopping the offending drugs.

This means:

### **She most likely has a mix of:**
- **Drug-Induced Parkinsonism** (main part)
**plus possibly**
- **a Tardive component** (the part that did not fully go away)

That is exactly what her pattern suggests:
**A strong reaction to heavy dopamine-blocking medicines (Risperidone/Paliperidone).**

---

# **4. What Went Wrong in Her Care Journey**

Here we stay neutral and respectful, but we must name patterns clearly.

### **A. Too many abrupt changes**
- Stopping Olanzapine suddenly.
- Starting Risperidone and rapidly increasing.
- Removing Aripiprazole quickly.
- Replacing everything with Paliperidone LAI without first stabilizing her.

A brain as sensitive as Suparna’s **cannot tolerate sudden switches**.

---

### **B. Tremors were not tracked with proper tools**
In movement disorders, doctors must use structured scales (AIMS, SAS, BARS). There is **no evidence these were used**.

---

### **C. The long-acting injection was continued despite clear signs of harm**
Paliperidone LAI locks the medication into the body for a month at a time. If side effects appear, you cannot “pull it out.”
She was kept on it even though:
- tremors worsened,
- behaviour worsened,
- injections triggered severe shaking.

This destroyed trust.

---

### **D. Family’s concerns about bias toward a particular clinic**
I will not judge motives, but I *can* acknowledge that:
- The family experienced behaviour that felt like conflict-of-interest.
- Her refusals to stop or change certain medications felt dismissive.
Trust eroded deeply.
fileciteturn0file0

---

# **5. A Clear, Practical Plan Going Forward (Educational, Not Prescriptions)**

### **Goal:**
- Reduce tremors.
- Reduce delusions.
- Restore predictable functioning.
- Use the fewest medicines possible.

---

## **Step 1 — Identify the exact type of tremor (crucial).**
Use three simple rating scales at every visit:
- **SAS** → stiffness & parkinson-like shaking
- **BARS** → inner restlessness
- **AIMS** → tardive movements

This prevents guesswork and protects her from wrong treatments.

---

## **Step 2 — Return to a single antipsychotic that has repeatedly worked: Olanzapine**

Olanzapine has shown:
- best behavioural stabilization,
- lowest EPS/tremor impact in her case,
- best tolerance historically.

The dose should be **the lowest effective**, but **not too low**, because too-low doses cause relapse.

---

## **Step 3 — Remove or Reduce Tremor-Causing Medicines**

**Stop  → Risperidone, Paliperidone, and all fast-acting injections.**
Her body is too sensitive to them.
(This is not a prescription—just clear pattern recognition.)

---

## **Step 4 — If tremors remain after simplifying meds**

### **If mostly Parkinson-like:**
- Use Pacitane only short-term, then taper.
- Use small-dose Propranolol if needed.

### **If tardive movements confirmed:**
- **VMAT2 inhibitors (like Valbenazine)** are the evidence-based treatment.
- Pacitane should NOT be used (it can worsen tardive movements).

---

## **Step 5 — Long-term definitive treatment: Clozapine**

Clozapine is the **gold standard** for people who:
- do not respond fully to other antipsychotics, **and**
- develop movement problems with typical medicines.

Why Clozapine fits Suparna:
- It has **lowest tremor risk**.
- Helps people with strong delusions that resist other medicines.
- Reduces aggression and behavioural rigidity.
- Often improves tardive movements.

It requires **regular blood tests** for the first year, but stabilizes many people with her profile.

---

## **Step 6 — Adherence plan (non-covert, respectful, effective)**

- Use **orally-disintegrating tablets (ODT)** so she cannot hide or spit out medicine.
- One family member observes the dose daily.
- Keep the regimen simple:
  **1 antipsychotic + (maybe) 1 movement-aid + 1 antidepressant if needed.**
- No changes unless everyone—family and clinician—understands the reason.

---

## **Step 7 — Safety plan**

If she:
- stops eating,
- forces husband to stop eating,
- becomes violent,
- refuses all medication

→ seek urgent in-person help.
Remote supervision cannot keep her safe in those states.

---

# **Summary You Can Carry in Your Pocket**

- **Olanzapine works for her.**
- **Risperidone and Paliperidone caused the tremors.**
- Tremor type = mostly **drug-induced parkinsonism**, maybe some **tardive** component.
- Too many sudden medication changes made things worse.
- Long-acting injectables that are too “strong” for her system broke trust.
- She needs **simple, stable, long-term care**, not frequent switches.
- **Clozapine** is the long-term solution most aligned with her pattern.
- Movement scales must guide every decision.
- Family supervision and a stable, respectful care plan are essential.

If you’d like, I can now:
✅ Turn this into a **one-page summary for the next psychiatrist**
or
✅ Create a **family action plan** (daily checklist, relapse warning signs, medication-supervision plan)
or
✅ Create a **visual timeline** of her medication journey.

Just tell me what you prefer.

## You (2025-11-18T14:06:35.136000+00:00)

Based on the following additional medical information of the patient, the conditions, and potential next steps, create a list of questions we need answers to before we explore additional treatment options, and for which we can perform some lab tests from a place like orange labs in india.

---

## 0. Purpose of This Outline

* This document is **not** the raw case history (which is in the original report).
* It captures:

  * **Inferences, hypotheses, and patterns** we discovered together.
  * **Clinical reasoning** about meds, tremors, and behaviour.
  * **Questions + next-step ideas** to discuss with doctors.
* It is meant as a **bridge** between your lived observations and a psychiatrist’s decision-making.

---

## 1. Big-Picture Clinical Interpretation

1.1. **Core illness picture (as it emerges from our discussion)**

* Chronic psychotic disorder with:

  * Severe **food- and purity-related delusions**.
  * Strong **control behaviours** over husband and household (fasting, restricting his food/phone).
  * Long periods of **isolation and social withdrawal**.
* Behaviour is clearly **medication-sensitive**:

  * Dramatically worse off antipsychotics.
  * Far safer and “kinder” on certain medicines (especially olanzapine, and later paliperidone+olanzapine).

1.2. **Key tensions**

* Medicines that best “hold” her psychosis (paliperidone) **wreck her movements**.
* Medicines that are safer for movement (olanzapine) **don’t yet match** that same level of thought control—at least not in the messy conditions they were tried.
* Adherence, side effects, and deep personality traits all interact.

---

## 2. Medication Response – Interpretive Nuances (Beyond the File)

2.1. **Olanzapine (Oleanz/Tolaz)**

* Consistent pattern:

  * **Presence** → improved functioning, reduced aggression, more routine.
  * **Absence or low dose** → relapse to fasting, aggression, coercion.
* Not just a “sedative”:

  * Likely provides genuine **antipsychotic effect**, not just calm.
  * Trials may not have been:

    * fully adherent,
    * at optimal dose for long enough,
    * or done with clear behavioural tracking.

2.2. **Risperidone → Paliperidone LAI**

* Strong link between:

  * Starting/increasing these → **severe tremors**,
  * Washout → **tremors partially improve**.
* Mental stability:

  * Paliperidone LAI 100 mg gave **marked mental stability**, but **not total**:

    * There was still a major “no food/phone” relapse **while on 100 mg**.
  * This proves paliperidone alone was **helpful but insufficient**.

2.3. **Paliperidone + Olanzapine Combination**

* The “best” mental state you saw may correspond to **the combination**:

  * Paliperidone LAI 100 mg + Olanzapine 5 mg.
* That suggests:

  * She responds well to **strong, steady antipsychotic coverage**, and
  * Her brain seems to like **olanzapine’s “style”** of calming on top.
* But tremors remained severe → **not sustainable**.

2.4. **Aripiprazole**

* As add-on: some improvement in engagement and mood.
* Never really tested as **sole main antipsychotic** in a structured trial.

---

## 3. Tremors & Movements – Our Best-Fit Interpretation

3.1. **Based on your detailed observations**

* Face/head:

  * No eyebrow twitching or grimacing.
  * Repetitive **mouth + jaw movements**, with **whole-head shaking** (side-to-side / back-and-forth).
* Hands/feet:

  * **Large, jerky tremor** (“nervous man with a glass of water” type), not fine, not rhythmic.
  * Same type in feet as hands, not toe-tapping or twisting.
* Whole body:

  * Limbs tremor at slightly different rhythms; during injections, **whole body can join in**.
* Gait:

  * Slow due to tremor, **not** from stiffness or shuffling.
* Rigidity:

  * **No stiffness** when limbs are passively moved.
* Inner restlessness:

  * She can sit still; no urge to pace.
  * Shaking worsens when thoughts are “going haywire” (stress trigger), not because she “can’t stop moving.”

3.2. **What this most likely is**

* **Not classic akathisia** (she can sit still; no driving inner motor restlessness).
* **Not classic drug-induced Parkinsonism**:

  * No rigidity, no tiny shuffling steps, no fine rhythmic “pill-rolling” tremor.
* **Not classic choreoathetoid tardive dyskinesia** (no slow writhing, tongue darting, choreic movements).
* Best fit:

  * **Medication-induced tremor**, probably driven by **high-dose risperidone/paliperidone**,
  * with possible **“tardive tremor”** component (persistent even after dose reduction).

3.3. **Implications for Pacitane**

* Pacitane (trihexyphenidyl) mainly helps **Parkinsonian stiffness and classic tremor**.
* Her pattern:

  * Little to no stiffness.
  * Coarse, stress-sensitive tremor.
* Therefore:

  * Pacitane may be providing **limited benefit**.
  * A cautious trial of **gradual Pacitane reduction**, with close tremor monitoring, is rational to see if it’s truly needed or adding anticholinergic burden.

---

## 4. Movement Scales – How to Anchor the Conversation Clinically

4.1. **Key tools to request**

* **AIMS** → tardive / abnormal involuntary movements.
* **SAS** → drug-induced parkinsonism.
* **BARS** → akathisia (inner restlessness).

4.2. **Why they matter beyond the report**

* They convert your lived observations into **scores** a doctor trusts.
* They help distinguish:

  * tremor vs stiffness vs inner urge to move.
* They guide:

  * whether Pacitane is appropriate,
  * whether a VMAT2 inhibitor should be considered,
  * whether to avoid drugs with high EPS risk.

---

## 5. Olanzapine vs Risperidone/Paliperidone – Deeper Nuances

5.1. **Different “style” of dopamine block**

* **Risperidone/Paliperidone**:

  * Tight D2 grip → strong antipsychotic effect, but high EPS (tremors) in sensitive people.
* **Olanzapine**:

  * Looser D2 grip, more histamine and muscarinic action → calming, sedating, less EPS but more weight gain.

5.2. **In Suparna**

* Risperidone/paliperidone:

  * Provided strong symptom reduction but **crossed her movement tolerance threshold**.
* Olanzapine:

  * Provides meaningful symptom control and calming, without the same movement catastrophe, but:

    * doses and trials may not have been fully optimized,
    * adherence and environment were not tightly controlled.

5.3. **Paliperidone LAI mental “success” was not pure**

* Best stability may have occurred during **paliperidone + olanzapine** phase.
* She even had a **relapse while on 100 mg LAI alone**, proving:

  * paliperidone is **not a complete solution**,
  * her illness is at least **partially treatment-resistant**.

---

## 6. Dopamine Pathways & Motivation – Clarified Hypothesis

6.1. **Your hypothesis**

* Question: is the same “excess dopamine” causing:

  * her delusions, and
  * her lack of interest in normal rewarding activities?

6.2. **Refined medical framing**

* Different dopamine circuits:

  * **Mesolimbic**: too much → delusions, assigning excessive importance to certain ideas (e.g., food danger).
  * **Mesocortical**: too little → apathy, poor motivation, cognitive dullness.
  * **Nigrostriatal**: too little (from meds) → tremors, stiffness.
* Her lack of interest likely comes from:

  * negative symptoms,
  * possibly depression,
  * medication effects (sedation, dulling),
  * deep personality and demoralization.
* So: “dopamine dysregulation” is shared, but **not a single, simple ‘too much everywhere’** story.

---

## 7. Why Clozapine Fits Her Case Conceptually

7.1. **Why move beyond current SGAs**

* Tried:

  * Olanzapine → partial success, metabolic issues.
  * Risperidone/Paliperidone → strong mental effect but severe tremors, still not full control.
* This matches **treatment-resistant** category where guidelines point to **clozapine**.

7.2. **What clozapine offers**

* Strongest evidence for:

  * treatment-resistant schizophrenia,
  * reducing aggression and suicidal behaviour.
* Lowest risk of **classic EPS tremors/stiffness**.
* Potential to **improve existing tardive movements**.
* Fits a person who:

  * needs strong antipsychotic power,
  * but cannot tolerate “hard” D2 blockade like paliperidone.

7.3. **Trade-off**

* Metabolic side effects (weight, sugar, lipids) **as bad or worse than olanzapine**.
* Serious but rare risks:

  * agranulocytosis, myocarditis, seizures, severe constipation.
* Requires **strict monitoring**, family vigilance, and clear emergency plan.

---

## 8. Clozapine: Side-Effect Strategy & What-If-It-Goes-Bad Plan

8.1. **“Buckets” of side effects**

* **Bucket A – Manage & Continue**

  * Sedation, drooling, constipation (if managed), weight gain, dizziness.

* **Bucket B – Pause / Investigate**

  * Persistent tachycardia, unexplained fevers, suspected seizure, concerning confusion.

* **Bucket C – Stop Now**

  * Agranulocytosis (low ANC), myocarditis, severe bowel obstruction, serious arrhythmias.

8.2. **If clozapine must be stopped**

* Psychosis likely worsens again.
* Plan B options:

  * Optimized **olanzapine** (with endocrine/metabolic support).
  * **Aripiprazole** (oral → LAI if tolerated).
  * Carefully considered, time-limited antipsychotic combinations.
  * Stronger **non-medication structure** at home (clear rules, boundaries, supervised meals).

8.3. **Questions to discuss before starting clozapine**

* Monitoring schedule (ANC, ECG, metabolic labs).
* Clear “if X happens, we do Y” rules for:

  * fever, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, severe constipation.
* Thresholds for stopping vs managing side effects.
* Weight/metabolic protection plan (diet, metformin, endocrinology).

---

## 9. Long-Acting Options – Why Olanzapine LAI Isn’t on the Table

9.1. **Olanzapine LAI exists** (olanzapine pamoate, Zyprexa Relprevv) but:

* Carries **Post-Injection Delirium/Sedation Syndrome (PDSS)** risk.
* Requires **3-hour monitored observation in a hospital** after every shot.
* Rarely used in practice; often unavailable or impractical in India.

9.2. **Realistic LAI alternative**

* **Aripiprazole LAI**, if:

  * oral aripiprazole is first tested and well-tolerated,
  * akathisia risk is manageable.
* Goal: combine **steady coverage** with **lower EPS risk** than paliperidone.

---

## 10. How to Use All This with Doctors – Key Questions & Phrasings

10.1. **On movement disorder**

* “Her movements look more like medication-induced tremor than classic Parkinsonism or akathisia. Can we document AIMS/SAS/BARS and re-evaluate the role of Pacitane?”

10.2. **On paliperidone history**

* “She was mentally most stable during paliperidone LAI + olanzapine, but had a severe movement disorder and even relapsed once on LAI alone. Does this support moving toward clozapine or a gentler LAI instead of returning to paliperidone?”

10.3. **On considering clozapine**

* “Given her partial response to multiple antipsychotics and severe EPS on paliperidone, do you see her as a clozapine candidate? If yes, what would your monitoring and side-effect management plan look like?”

10.4. **On Pacitane**

* “She has tremor without stiffness or shuffling. Pacitane helps Parkinsonian stiffness more than tardive or non-Parkinsonian tremors. Would you consider a slow Pacitane taper with AIMS/SAS/BARS tracking to see if it’s really helping?”

10.5. **On olanzapine**

* “Is it worth a structured, fully supervised olanzapine trial at an agreed target dose, with metabolic support and clear behaviour tracking, before or alongside a clozapine plan?”

---

## 11. Family-Level Insights & Strategies (Beyond Original File)

11.1. **Adherence**

* Use **ODT (orally disintegrating)** olanzapine to reduce cheeking.
* One consistent family member supervises dosing daily.

11.2. **Food environment**

* Structural changes (what’s in the house, when sweets are allowed) rather than constant negotiation.
* Framing weight gain as **medicine effect**, not “weakness.”

11.3. **Relapse signals**

* Early signs:

  * intensifying food rules,
  * renewed attempts to control husband’s meals or phone,
  * increased isolation.
* Pre-agreed response:

  * escalate to doctor sooner,
  * consider short-term containment/hospital evaluation if safety is at risk.

## 1️⃣ Questions About Tremors & Nervous System

### Q1. Are her tremors purely from medicines, or is there any other medical cause?

**Why this matters:**
If something else (thyroid, electrolytes, vitamin deficiency) is worsening the tremor, we can fix that **without touching antipsychotics**.

**Labs that help:**

- **Thyroid function tests**
  - TSH, Free T4 (± Free T3)
- **Electrolytes**
  - Sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium
- **Liver & kidney function tests (LFT, RFT)**
  - To exclude liver/kidney issues that might change how drugs are cleared.

---

### Q2. Is there any vitamin or mineral deficiency contributing to tremors, fatigue, or low motivation?

**Why:**
B12, Vitamin D, and iron problems can cause **weakness, low mood, cognitive dulling, and sometimes odd sensations or movements**. Her diet is highly restricted, so these are real risks. fileciteturn0file0

**Labs:**

- **Vitamin B12**
- **Vitamin D (25-OH)**
- **Iron profile**
  - Serum iron, ferritin, TIBC, transferrin saturation
- **Serum folate** (if available)

---

## 2️⃣ Questions About Thyroid & Hormones

We already know there were **thyroid abnormalities in the past** and Thyronorm was started. fileciteturn0file0

### Q3. Is her thyroid currently over- or under-treated?

**Why:**
Thyroid imbalance can cause:
- Tremors, anxiety, palpitations (if too much hormone), or
- Lethargy, low mood, cognitive slowing (if too little).

**Labs:**

- **TSH**
- **Free T4** (± Free T3)

*(Do this while she is on her current Thyronorm dose, if she’s still taking it.)*

---

### Q4. Is high prolactin contributing to tiredness, mood changes, or other physical issues?

**Why:**
Risperidone and paliperidone are famous for **raising prolactin**, which can cause fatigue, menstrual issues (if pre-menopausal), low sex drive, bone loss over time. Even though paliperidone has been reduced/stopped, it is good to know where things stand now.

**Lab:**

- **Serum prolactin**

---

## 3️⃣ Questions About Metabolism & “Clozapine Readiness”

If you ever move toward **clozapine** or continue/use **olanzapine long term**, you must know her **metabolic baseline**.

### Q5. How much have the medicines affected her sugar, cholesterol, and weight-related risk?

**Why:**
Olanzapine and especially clozapine strongly affect **weight, blood sugar, and lipids**.

**Labs:**

- **Fasting blood sugar (FBS)**
- **HbA1c**
- **Lipid profile**
  - Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides

Also record:
- **Weight, height, BMI, waist circumference** (can be done at home + clinic).

---

### Q6. Is her liver and kidney function good enough for stronger medicines (like clozapine) and for handling multiple drugs?

**Why:**
Almost all psych meds are processed by the **liver** and/or **kidneys**. Clozapine especially needs a reasonably healthy baseline.

**Labs:**

- **Liver function tests (LFT)**
  - AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, albumin
- **Renal function tests (RFT)**
  - Urea, creatinine, eGFR
- **Serum electrolytes** (if not already done above)

---

## 4️⃣ Questions About Blood Counts & Infection Risk

These are essential **before even discussing clozapine** seriously, and still useful even if you never start it.

### Q7. Are her white cells and platelets normal right now?

**Why:**
- Clozapine can lower white cells (especially neutrophils).
- Her past labs mentioned **slightly low platelets**. fileciteturn0file0
You want to know if there is a **chronic issue** or if things are stable.

**Labs:**

- **Complete blood count (CBC)** with differential
  - Pay special attention to:
    - Total WBC
    - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
    - Platelets
    - Hemoglobin, MCV (anemia pattern)

---

### Q8. Is there any silent infection or inflammation that could complicate new meds?

**Why:**
If there is ongoing infection/inflammation, starting a complex drug like clozapine can be riskier. It’s also important if she looks more tired or slowed than expected.

**Labs:**

- **ESR** (erythrocyte sedimentation rate)
- **CRP** (C-reactive protein)

(These are non-specific but useful as a background check.)

---

## 5️⃣ Questions About Nutrition & Long-Term Restricted Diet

Her long-term pattern of **eating mainly refined carbs and avoiding dairy, fruits, nuts, green vegetables** strongly raises concerns about nutritional deficits. fileciteturn0file0

### Q9. Is she malnourished in ways that could affect brain function, energy, and bone health?

**Why:**
Even if weight looks okay, her **nutrient quality** may be poor.

**Labs:**

- **Serum albumin and total protein**
- **Vitamin B12**
- **Folate**
- **Vitamin D**
- **Calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase** (bone health markers)

Optional if available / affordable:
- **Serum zinc** (if her diet is extremely narrow and poor in protein)

---

## 6️⃣ Questions About Heart & Safety for Future Meds

Especially important if considering **clozapine** or continuing antipsychotics that affect the heart rhythm.

### Q10. Is her heart rhythm and basic cardiac status safe for antipsychotics + escitalopram combination?

**Why:**
- Some antipsychotics and escitalopram can slightly increase the risk of **heart rhythm changes (QT prolongation)**.
- Clozapine can rarely cause **myocarditis** or other cardiac issues.

**Tests:**

- **ECG (Electrocardiogram)** – at a local diagnostic center / cardiology lab
- **Basic cardiac labs (if planning clozapine / if any cardiac symptoms)**:
  - Troponin I (or T) – *only if symptoms like chest pain, breathlessness, unexplained tachycardia*
  - NT-proBNP – *if there’s suspicion of heart failure symptoms*

(These extra cardiac labs are usually ordered by a doctor if concern arises; you don’t need to pre-order them unless guided.)

## 7️⃣ Questions About Other Brain/Neurologic Causes (Beyond Drugs)

Here we step slightly outside “lab only”, but these are **questions to ask doctors** where labs might support the decision.

### Q11. Is there any structural brain condition contributing to her symptoms?

**Why:**
Her illness behaves very much like a primary psychotic disorder, but in older adults it is still sometimes important to **exclude stroke, tumor, or degenerative diseases** if never done.

**Doctor-facing question:**
- “Has she ever had an MRI brain? If not, do you think it’s needed at this stage?”

*(MRI is not from Orange Labs, but from imaging centres; included here as a key question.)*

## 8️⃣ Questions Specifically Around Pacitane, Tremors & TD Risk

### Q12. Is Pacitane actually helping, or is it just adding side effects (confusion, dryness, risk of worsening tardive movements)?

**Why:**
Her tremor description (coarse, stress-sensitive, no stiffness, no shuffling gait) suggests it may **not** be the classic Parkinson-type tremor Pacitane is best for. fileciteturn0file0

**Here labs are less important; the key is:**

- Request **AIMS / SAS / BARS** ratings in clinic to classify movements properly.
- Then ask:
  > “If AIMS/SAS/BARS suggest this is not classic parkinsonian tremor, can we try a **slow Pacitane taper**, monitoring tremor and cognition?”

No special lab is required just for Pacitane, but **CBC, LFT, RFT** (already recommended) help ensure nothing else is going on.

## 9️⃣ Questions About Readiness for Clozapine (If/When You Go There)

Think of this as a **“pre-Clozapine safety checklist.”**

### Q13. Do her blood counts, liver/kidney function, and ECG suggest she is physically safe enough for a supervised clozapine trial?

**Why:**
You want to know **before** you sit in the psychiatrist’s office whether there are obvious red flags.

This is essentially a **bundle of earlier labs**, but grouped for this purpose:

- **CBC with differential + ANC**
- **LFT, RFT, Electrolytes**
- **Fasting glucose, HbA1c, Lipid profile**
- **ECG**

Bring all these as **recent results (within 1–3 months)** to any doctor discussing clozapine.

## 🔟 How to Organize This Practically

You could group tests into **3 lab visits** to keep it sane and affordable:

### Visit 1 – Basic Medical & Metabolic Baseline
- CBC with differential
- LFT, RFT, Electrolytes
- Fasting glucose, HbA1c
- Lipid profile
- ESR, CRP

### Visit 2 – Endocrine & Nutrition
- TSH, Free T4
- Vitamin B12, Folate
- Vitamin D
- Iron studies
- Calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, albumin/total protein
- Prolactin

### Visit 3 – Cardiac & Any Extras
- ECG
- Any doctor-recommended extras (troponin, etc.) based on symptoms

## How to Use This With Her Doctors

You can literally walk in with a sheet titled:

> **“Questions we’d like to clarify, we’ve done these labs in advance.”**

and list, for example:

1. “Do these labs show any medical cause for her tremors or fatigue?”
2. “Do you think her movement pattern fits more with drug-induced tremor, Parkinsonism, or tardive movements, and how does that affect Pacitane?”
3. “Looking at these results, do you consider her physically fit for a structured olanzapine-only trial or, if needed, a carefully monitored clozapine trial?”

If you’d like, I can now turn this into:

- a **printable one-page lab requisition + question sheet**, or
- a **doctor-facing summary note** attaching these questions to her history in simple bullet form.

# Unfinished personal projects

## You (2025-08-10T04:42:31.463997+00:00)

Could you go through my past chats and find me all the personal projects I initiated but left halfway through our never revisited.

Totally—happy to help. I can’t see your *entire* ChatGPT history unless you upload your export, but here’s a first-pass audit from the recent chats in this project (Jul–Aug 2025). These look like personal projects that were started and then stalled or never fully closed:

**Likely unfinished / not revisited**
- **Local OSS model to analyze your past chats** (Aug 9) — idea captured, no build steps yet.
- **Flexible email-discovery tool (CLI + CSV)** (Jul 15, ongoing theme) — specs discussed, no shipped code.
- **Aragon.ai discount-code OSINT sweep** (Jul 27) — big research brief; unclear if we compiled/verified the full 6-field table you wanted.
- **Identify Mike Ross’s exact jacket (Suits S2E2 date scene)** (Jul 24) — deep ID task; don’t see a confirmed brand/model/season returned.
- **Levi’s-specific fit cheat sheet** (Jul 24) — requested after body-measurement guide; don’t see the Levi-only version delivered.
- **Urban casual style visuals** (Jul 24) — you asked for renders/edits; we pivoted/paused around image requests and didn’t land final visuals.
- **Lightweight SF jacket by Monday (7/29)** (Jul 24) — tight deadline; I don’t see a final pick + pickup plan confirmed.

**Status unclear (might be done, but no explicit “done” marker)**
- **Beginner dance tutorial set** (Jul 21) — you wanted a curated, category-based starter curriculum; not sure we finalized the playlist.
- **Daily meds reminder** (May 22) — you asked for a 5:00pm daily reminder; can’t confirm whether it’s actually set and firing.

If you want a **complete** list across *all* past chats, just drop your ChatGPT export (the ZIP or the `conversations.json`) here and I’ll scan everything for “project-shaped” threads (mission-style asks, constraints, deliverables) and flag ones without a clear completion message. I’ll return a tidy table (Project • First seen • Last activity • What’s missing • Next action), and a CSV you can track.

Want me to also spin this into a little “Projects to revive” checklist you can edit? I can pop it into a canvas doc.

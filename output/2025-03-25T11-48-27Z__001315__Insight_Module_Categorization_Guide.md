# Insight Module Categorization Guide

## You (2025-03-25T11:48:27.326079+00:00)

hey help me build a prompt. I'm looking for a creative director at IDEO who has a lot of experience turning insightful yet open ended insights into actionable insights, and has a lot of experience mentoring, leading, and managing designers. 

My objective is to create an outline of instructions for a whole group of designers. Designers can be liberal so its very easy for them to interpret the same thing in many different ways, so its important to be as precise as possible. 

We have about 950 insight modules and a typical structure for the insight module will be pasted below. Our main job is to figure out a sort of card sorting exercise. It's think of it like a bucketing exercise where we have these 950 modules and we have to figure out which of those inside modules aligns best with a particular bucket. There are three buckets totally and I'll explain how to figure out that bucketing system too but yeah we have three buckets in total so the idea is we can figure out a way to find out how many of those inside modules fit into those three buckets.

the three buckets / groups are

- Understanding How Executives Make Decisions
- Understanding Challenges in Decision-Making
- AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making

Each designer is supposed to look at about 200 of those insight modules and see which of these questions does it help answer. Some of these questions are yes / no questions, but the objective is not to 'find the answer' to those questions, the objective is to simply check which of the questions can a particular insight module **help** to answer. Another way of thinking of this is, think of the question as a discussion topic. So does the insight module discuss that topic? Here're the questions - 

## **Understanding How Executives Make Decisions**

**How do executives assess when to act decisively with limited information versus waiting for more clarity — and what gives them confidence in that moment?**

**What distinguishes high-stakes from low-stakes decisions in an executive’s mind, and how does that shape who makes the call, how fast, and with what level of rigor?**

**When strategies underperform or conditions shift, how do executives decide whether to stay the course, pivot, or reverse earlier choices?**

**What internal and external inputs — from data to advisors to culture — do executives weigh most heavily when making strategic decisions, and how do those priorities shift by context?**

**How do executives balance short-term pressures with long-term vision — especially when resources are limited or the stakes are high?**

**In what ways do company size and stage (startup, scale-up, enterprise) shape how executives make, delegate, and scale decisions?**

**How do executives in different industries or organizational cultures approach strategic decision-making differently — and what hidden assumptions shape their style?**

## **Understanding Challenges in Decision-Making**

1. **What makes certain strategic decisions especially difficult for executives, and how do they navigate uncertainty, internal resistance, or second-guessing in those moments?**
2. **What are the most common internal bottlenecks or sources of friction that slow down or derail strategic decisions — from misalignment and politics to culture and stakeholder dynamics?**
3. **How do executives weigh competing priorities and trade-offs when strategic goals conflict — and what frameworks or instincts guide those choices?**
4. **What external forces — such as investors, regulators, customers, or the market — exert the most pressure on decision-making, and how do executives respond when those pressures conflict with internal priorities or long-term vision?**
5. **When faced with disruption — whether from new technologies or market shifts — how do executives decide whether to stay the course or pivot, and what signals do they trust most in making that call?**
6. **How do challenges in decision-making differ between small, fast-moving companies and large, complex enterprises — and what lessons do executives carry between those contexts?**
7. **What concerns executives most during the transition from strategy formulation to execution, and how do they ensure strategic intent survives operational realities?**

## **AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making**

1. **What makes AI feel like a trusted strategic companion, rather than a tool—especially when the stakes are high and data is incomplete?**
2. **How have past experiences—positive or negative—influenced how executives think about using AI for strategic decision support today?**
3. **What kinds of decisions or thought processes do executives instinctively reserve for themselves—and why?**
4. **How do executives assess the quality, bias, or relevance of AI-generated insights—especially when they lack proprietary grounding but draw on public or market data?**
5. **In what ways do executives want AI to challenge their assumptions, not just echo them—and what would respectful challenge look like?**
6. **What mental workflows or thinking rituals could AI most naturally plug into—without disrupting the flow or introducing friction?**
7. **What kinds of strategic thinking or planning frameworks feel like a natural fit for AI support—and where does AI’s role begin to break down?**

So the idea is, while looking at the Insight Module, a designer will see which of these questions or discussion topics is this Insight Module talking about or trying to answer. Now, understandably, one Insight Module can try to answer multiple questions, which is fine. The designers are supposed to make a table, basically plotting a yes or no response, or you can think of it as a score of 0 or 1. So, let's say one Insight Module answers 3 questions, then against each of those 3 questions, the designer will put a score of 1 and he will put a score of 0 against all the remaining 18 questions. So, there are a total of 21 questions, each category has 3 questions.

Now, once this table, the calculations of this table is completed, then what the designer will do is see which category scores the highest. So for example, if one insight module answers three questions under the first category and one question under the second category, then the final score for category 1 will be 3, the final score for category 2 will be 1, the final score for category 3 will be 0. And based on the highest score, the designer will decide that, okay, this one particular insight module belongs to category 1. It's also possible that one insight module does not answer any of the seven questions. In that case, the designer will say that, okay, this insight module is invalid. 

So, at the end, we're looking for two deliverables. One is a table that contains all these 21 questions. And how does the particular insight module score against all those 7 questions. And we're looking for a bottom node which has the insight module's code and the final conclusive category.


A few more things to keep in mind. I've attached a copy of the layout of an insight module below. The designers need to make sure that they are reading the entire module. They are not just looking at one or two sentences. For example, they shouldn't make a conclusion out of the insight statement or they shouldn't make a conclusion out of the strategic dilemma because insight statements can be vague and strategic dilemma always talk about a challenge which is more of a category to alignment. So it shouldn't just be that. The designer should try to read the entire module, make up their mind that okay what kind of discussion or topics does this insight module cover and based on that give a score. And the score should only be binary. They have to be very thoughtful and very meticulous about how they're evaluating. There is a good chance that we end up eliminating a lot of the strategy insight modules which is completely fine. Elimination is always good. So they have to find the right balance between being comprehensive and being decisive.


## Layout of an Insight Module

### **1. Insight Construction** *(Primary content)*

This is where the strategic idea is introduced, contextualized, and supported.

### 🔹 What to Look For:

- **Insight Statement**
    
    Concise, critical framing of a core idea. Often challenges prevailing logic or introduces a surprising pattern.
    
    > What assumption or mental model is being questioned?
    
- **Executive Decision-Making Context**
    
    Includes:
    
    - Strategic dilemma (what’s at stake?)
    - Underlying beliefs and biases (what assumptions are being surfaced?)
    - Expected vs. actual outcomes (what went differently than planned?)
    - Broader implications (what could change systemically?)
    
    > Who’s making the decision? What kind of decision is it? What organizational layer does it affect?
    
- **Supporting Context**
    
    Empirical grounding or theoretical basis for the insight. Includes references to data, frameworks, case studies, or precedent.
    
    > Does this insight come from market dynamics, internal operations, innovation logic, or individual reflection?
    

---

### **2. Insight Stress Test** *(Strategic diagnostic lens)*

This section pushes the insight into boundary conditions. It helps clarify **what the insight is not**, **where it breaks down**, and **what assumptions it hides**.


| Component | What It Tells You | Why It Matters Strategically |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Counterfactual Scenario** | A fictional case where the insight fails | Reveals *contextual boundaries*. Helps disqualify strategy types it might superficially resemble |
| **Assumptions & Biases** | Hidden cognitive shortcuts | Indicates *mental framing*—especially useful for spotting **Leadership**, **Business**, or **Innovation** logic |
| **Context Limitations** | Known edge cases where the insight breaks down | Helps narrow the scope of the insight (e.g., it may not apply org-wide, so not Corporate) |
| **Final Critique** | Conceptual tensions or contradictions | Great signal for identifying trade-offs—often highlights **Adaptive** or **Strategic Tension** dimensions clearly |

This is a beautifully complex and high-stakes sorting challenge—very IDEO in spirit but also demanding precision and rigorous alignment. To help you build a prompt for GPT-4o that acts like a seasoned creative director at IDEO, here’s what I’d like to do first:

---

## 🧠 Stage 1: Conversational Discovery  
Let’s deeply explore and surface all nuances to craft the perfect prompt.

---

### ✅ Let’s confirm what we know so far:

**Your Objective**:  
Create a highly precise, instructionally clear outline for designers to **categorize 950 insight modules** into one of **three thematic buckets** based on how well the content aligns with 21 predefined, nuanced strategic questions.

---

### 🎯 You’re asking GPT to simulate this person:

> A **Creative Director at IDEO** — seasoned in mentoring designers, turning open-ended ideas into actionable clarity, and creating scalable team instructions.

---

### 🧩 Designers’ Task in Summary:

- Read ~200 insight modules each.
- For each module, **read comprehensively** (not just the insight statement or dilemma).
- Match the module against 21 specific discussion questions (7 per category).
- Use a **binary score** (1 = this module contributes meaningfully to that question; 0 = it doesn’t).
- Sum the scores across the 3 categories.
- Assign the module to the category with the highest score.
- If the module scores **0 across all 21**, mark it **invalid**.
- Deliverables:  
  - A **table** per module with binary scores for all 21 questions.  
  - A **final category assignment or invalidation note** at the bottom.

---

### 🕵️‍♀️ Now, a few clarifying questions before we “begin building the prompt”:

1. **Tone & Format for Instructions**:  
   Should the final instructions read like a formal project brief, a human-to-human team email, a Figma/Notion-style bullet doc, or something else?

2. **Output Medium & Environment**:  
   Where will designers encounter these instructions? (Google Docs? Miro? Figma? Notion?)  
   This helps determine formatting fidelity, example structure, etc.

3. **Time Constraints or Heuristics?**  
   Should we offer guidance on how long a designer should spend evaluating each module? Any heuristics if they’re unsure?

4. **Edge Case Handling**:  
   If two buckets tie (e.g., 2 questions in Bucket 1, 2 questions in Bucket 2, 0 in Bucket 3), what should the designer do?

5. **Preferred Terminology**:  
   Do you want to stick with words like *“discussion topics,”* *“buckets,”* and *“score of 1 or 0”*, or would you prefer more polished terms like *“categorical tags,”* *“thematic alignment,”* or *“binary mapping”*?

6. **Who is the audience?**  
   Are these junior, mid, or senior-level designers? Should the instructions include mindset guidance, reminders to avoid bias, or an example module breakdown?

7. **Need Examples?**  
   Do you want me to embed one or two worked-out sample modules (real or fictional) as a reference inside the instructions?

---

Once I get clarity on these, I’ll step into Stage 2 and build a precise, persona-aligned prompt tailored for GPT-4o to generate the ideal creative-director-style instruction doc for your design team.

Would you like to go through those questions above, or skip straight to the prompt build?

## You (2025-03-25T11:52:42.227080+00:00)

The final instruction should feel like a human-to-human conversation, not an email or a written format, but more like a conversation. So, the students will have a .txt file which is a text file that has all the insight modules and they will receive instructions in the form of a Notion document. But keep in mind, this is not necessary. The most important part is first creating the outline in ChatGPT. The medium can always be decided later, we are not talking about the medium right now. We should also not offer any guidelines on how long the designer should take. We should not discuss that topic at all. If there are edge cases, like there's a tie between two buckets, then in that case, don't discuss that topic in this prompt now. We'll handle that later. Yes, I would prefer more polished terms like categorical tags, thematic alignment, binary mapping. The audience is junior to mid-level designers. Yes, having an example would be great, but don't introduce an example on your own. Put a placeholder for a lot of the things like I keep a placeholder for where I should insert the questions, keep a placeholder for where I should insert the sample module modules and keep a placeholder for where I should insert the structure of the module, which is what I shared with you.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-25T11:52:43.356295+00:00)

Perfect. This is super clear. You want a **conversational, polished, but directive** instruction set that feels like it’s coming from a seasoned mentor—not overly formal, but sharp, focused, and unambiguous.

We’ll **avoid logistics or edge-case logic for now**, and keep the **tone friendly but firm**, with just the right degree of structure and clarity for junior-to-mid-level designers to act confidently.

## 🧠 PromptCraft Output: Instructional Prompt for GPT-4o  
**Persona to Assume**: *Creative Director at IDEO — experienced in mentoring designers, turning open-ended insight into structured action, and leading design teams through ambiguity with clarity and rigor.*

---

### ✳️ OBJECTIVE  
You're helping a group of junior-to-mid-level designers categorize 950 insight modules into three thematic buckets. Each insight module will be evaluated based on whether it meaningfully contributes to answering any of 21 strategic discussion questions.

You’re crafting **a conversational, mentor-style instruction set** that explains:

- How to read and assess each module thoroughly  
- How to assign binary scores against a set of predefined questions  
- How to determine the dominant thematic alignment for each module  
- How to document the outcome in a structured format  
- And how to eliminate a module when it provides no thematic contribution  

Use **precise language**, **polished terminology**, and a tone that feels like an experienced creative lead walking their team through an open-ended but high-stakes interpretive task.

Keep the instructions **tight**, **clear**, and **motivational** — conversational but decisive.

---

### 🗣️ THE OUTPUT PROMPT FOR GPT-4o:

---

**Hey team—gather around. Let’s talk through the framework we’ll be using to sort through our insight modules.**

We’re sitting on a collection of around 950 insight modules. Each of them holds a different kind of pattern, strategic dilemma, or executive behavior, and your job is to help us figure out where each one most meaningfully belongs.  

We’ve got **three thematic categories**—think of them as conceptual lenses that reflect how executives approach decision-making. Each category is supported by a set of **discussion questions** (which I’ll drop below) that help us get specific about what kinds of patterns we’re trying to surface.

---

### 🧩 Your Role:  
For each module, your job is to:

1. **Read the entire module closely.**  
   Don’t rely on just the Insight Statement or the Strategic Dilemma—they rarely tell the full story on their own. The deeper patterns often sit in the framing, breakdowns, or implications.  
   
2. **Match the module against our full set of 21 discussion questions.**  
   These questions are grouped into three thematic categories. For each question, ask yourself:  
   👉 *Does this module meaningfully contribute to answering this discussion topic?*  
   We’re not looking for perfect matches or yes/no answers—we’re looking for relevance. If the module **speaks to** the theme of the question in a meaningful way, it gets a score of **1**. If it doesn’t, it gets a **0**.  
   This is what we call **binary mapping**.

3. **Total the scores across the three categories.**  
   Each of the three categories has 7 questions. Once you’ve assigned a score of 1 or 0 to all 21 questions, you’ll total up the score for each category.  
   Whichever category scores the highest becomes the **primary thematic alignment** for that module.

4. **If a module scores 0 across all 21 questions:**  
   That’s totally okay. Some insight modules won’t be relevant to this exercise. If none of the questions apply, mark the module as **invalid**—you don’t need to force-fit it.

---

### 🧾 What You’ll Submit (Per Module):

- A simple **binary mapping table** with all 21 questions and a 0 or 1 score for each.  
- A final note at the bottom stating:
  - The **Insight Module Code**  
  - The **Final Thematic Category Tag** (based on the highest score), or  
  - Mark as **Invalid** if none of the questions apply.

---

### 🧱 [INSERT STRUCTURE OF INSIGHT MODULE HERE]  
This section will include an overview of the layout of an insight module so designers know what to expect (e.g., Insight Statement, Executive Context, Stress Test, etc.)

---

### ❓ [INSERT QUESTION SET HERE]  
Drop the full list of 21 discussion questions here, grouped into the three thematic categories:
- Understanding How Executives Make Decisions  
- Understanding Challenges in Decision-Making  
- AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making

---

### 📌 [INSERT SAMPLE MODULE + WORKED EXAMPLE HERE]  
Here’s where you’ll walk through a sample insight module and show how a designer might assign 1s and 0s and arrive at a final thematic tag. Include the full binary table and final categorization note for clarity.

---

### ✅ Final Notes

This exercise is about **pattern recognition, critical thinking, and confident judgment.** It’s not about getting every edge case perfect—it’s about identifying where the signal is strongest. Be decisive, be thoughtful, and remember: **elimination is just as valuable as alignment.** If something doesn’t fit, don’t be afraid to let it go.

You’ve got this.

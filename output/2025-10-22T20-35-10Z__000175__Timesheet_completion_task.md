# Timesheet completion task



## You (2025-10-22T20:35:10.996000+00:00)

I need you to complete the hours in my timesheet for the month of September.

---

there are two tabs

1. Colibri Hours - google sheet
2. My Work Apps

---

the google sheet has my hours documents by date. I need you to use that as a reference, and fill in my hours for each of the days by week.

It looks like the “My Work Apps” tab (on Monday.com) is prompting for a login. Since entering credentials is sensitive, please take over and log in to your account. Once you’re logged in, let me know and I’ll continue filling out the timesheet based on your hours from the Google Sheet.

## You (2025-10-22T20:48:26.228000+00:00)

the My Works Apps is the following tab:

The link you provided opened the MWA portal, which requires you to choose a Google account and sign in. Since I can't handle your login credentials, please select the appropriate account and complete the sign‑in process. Let me know once you're logged in, and I'll continue filling out your timesheet.

I updated the hours for the 9/21–9/27 week based on your Google Sheet, but the My Work Apps site flags the 10‑hour entry on Wednesday, 24th September as invalid (it seems the system requires daily hours to stay within a specific limit).

At this point I cannot save the week because of this issue. Should I adjust the 10‑hour day (for example, record 8 hours and note the extra 2 hours in the “Additional Hours” column), or do you want me to handle it some other way? Let me know how you’d like me to proceed.

## You (2025-10-27T16:48:00.034000+00:00)

could you revisit the same link, and this time fill out hours for the month of october? you can just put 4 hours everyday. Save them, don't submit it. let me know when you're done























## ChatGPT (2025-10-27T16:48:43.075304+00:00)

The My Work Apps site requires you to sign in with your Google account again. Please select the appropriate account and complete the login process. Let me know once you’re logged in, and I’ll proceed to fill out your October timesheets with 4 hours each day and save them.

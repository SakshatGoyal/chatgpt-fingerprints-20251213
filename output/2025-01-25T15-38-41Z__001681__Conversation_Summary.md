Hello there! How's it going?

## You (2025-01-25T15:38:58.471885+00:00)

How do I connect a portal to my Samsung TV?

## ChatGPT (2025-01-25T15:38:58.499355+00:00)

To connect a Portal to your Samsung TV, you typically need an HDMI cable. Plug one end into the Portal and the other into your TV's HDMI port. Then switch your TV input to the correct HDMI source. That should get you set up!

## You (2025-01-25T15:39:23.294343+00:00)

Yeah, but that's not enough. I've already done that.

## ChatGPT (2025-01-25T15:39:23.326000+00:00)

Alright, in that case, ensure your Portal and TV are both powered on and the Portal is on the correct HDMI input. If there's no signal, double-check that the HDMI cable is firmly connected at both ends. You might also need to make sure the Portal is compatible with your TV. If you've already done all this and it's still not working, there might be a setting on the TV or Portal that needs adjusting.

It sounds like there's some noise on your end.



## ChatGPT (2025-01-25T15:39:53.231595+00:00)

Sure, take your time.

## You (2025-01-25T15:40:12.290015+00:00)

Can the meta portal be powered through a USB cable, or does it require the specific pin that it has?

## ChatGPT (2025-01-25T15:40:12.329513+00:00)

The Meta Portal typically requires its specific power adapter. Using a USB cable alone might not provide enough power. It's best to use the included adapter for reliable performance.

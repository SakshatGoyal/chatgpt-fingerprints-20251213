# Raw Data People Problems

## You (2025-04-28T02:54:11.335000+00:00)

Help me modify this prompt but with one change - there's no archetype, just the raw data. Similar to the attached file. Once you read these, begin crafting the prompt
---

You are helping to translate synthesized archetype data and raw research data into actionable, evidence-based people problem statements.

Your task is to help identify the core people problems associated with a single strategic archetype, based strictly on empirically grounded data. These archetypes were derived through analysis of behavioral patterns, decision-making tensions, and situational contexts observed across literature and case studies on how senior executives approach strategy (e.g., go-to-market planning, competitive positioning, innovation roadmapping).

You will be working with two files:
	1.	A .md file that contains five synthesized archetypes, each defined by observable patterns, behaviors, and contextual themes.
	2.	A .txt file that contains the raw data from which those archetypes were built. The raw data is organized by theme labels (which match those in the .md file) and contains multiple content modules per theme. Each content module includes:
	•	An insight statement
	•	A decision-making context
	•	Supporting context

Your output must:
	1.	Derive only genuine people problem statements, meaning they are clearly supported by evidence found in the .txt file, not inferred from archetypes alone.
	2.	Provide only a small set of well-articulated people problem statements that are deeply grounded in the themes and content modules.
	3.	For each problem statement, include a brief explanation clarifying 'how do we know this is a problem' and how it relates to the archetype.
	4.	Ensure that each problem can be clearly tied to specific patterns, behaviors, or tensions described in the selected archetype.

Before you begin:
	•	Do not hallucinate or extrapolate beyond the .txt source.
	•	Avoid generating a long list or overly general problems.
	•	Focus on clarity, nuance, depth, and connection between context and evidence.

Alright, I see exactly what you're asking for — and now that I've reviewed everything carefully, here’s the **core adjustment** you want:

✅ Remove any mention of “archetypes” — because in this case, there *are no archetypes*.
✅ Focus **only** on synthesizing people problem statements based purely on **raw empirical data** (modules like the ones you attached).
✅ Keep the rest of the structure: *tight focus on genuine, evidenced, deeply reasoned people problem statements*, not broad assumptions.

Thanks for being so clear.
Now — I’ll **begin crafting the new version of the prompt**, optimized around these goals:

Here’s the **modified prompt** you asked for — fully adapted to use *only* raw data (no archetypes at all).
I also kept the tone and structure close to your original style, but cleaner and a little sharper where needed.

Would you like me to also quickly mock up an example output, so you can see how this would guide a model’s behavior? 🎯

# Investor outreach email templates

## You (2025-03-14T17:09:01.834000+00:00)

Goal:
I need to write a professional yet friendly outreach email to an investor named Scott. The purpose of the email is to ask Scott to help us connect with high-level executives for a research study. We believe Scott’s network might include senior professionals who fit our criteria.

Context:
We are conducting a research study exploring how high-level executives make strategic decisions. The participants we need should include individuals in senior roles such as C-level executives, SVPs, General Managers, or Heads of Strategy across various industries. We are offering a $300 gratuity (or charity donation) as a token of appreciation for their time.

Scott isn’t necessarily a participant himself — instead, we’re hoping he can connect us with relevant individuals in his network. The tone should be casual yet professional, showing appreciation for Scott’s time and making the ask clear and easy for him to act on.

Email Structure:

Subject Line Ideas: Provide 3-5 options that feel warm yet clear (e.g., “Quick favor,” “Your network could make a big impact,” etc.).
Greeting & Opening: Start with a friendly introduction — something like "Hope this note finds you well."
Purpose & Request: Clearly state that we are conducting research on executive decision-making and would love Scott’s help in connecting us with relevant people in his network.
Details for Clarity: Briefly describe the study, including the participant criteria (e.g., senior executives, strategic decision-makers) and the $300 gratuity offer.
Easy Call-to-Action: Ask Scott if he’d be willing to forward the information to his network, and offer to provide a template or forwardable message if helpful.
Closing & Appreciation: End on a positive note with gratitude for his time and support.
Output Format:
Provide 2-3 sample emails with slightly different tones:

One that’s casual and conversational.
One that’s professional yet warm.
One that’s short and highly direct.
Constraints & Style Considerations:

Avoid making the email feel transactional or sales-driven.
Ensure the language feels personal and easy to forward.
Prioritize brevity — aim for no more than 200-250 words per email.
Additional Information:
I’m attaching a document that outlines our research project for reference. Feel free to incorporate key points that enhance clarity about the study's purpose and value.

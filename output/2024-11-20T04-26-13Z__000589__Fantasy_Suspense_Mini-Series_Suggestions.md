# Fantasy Suspense Mini-Series Suggestions



## You (2024-11-20T04:26:13.223990+00:00)

Hey, I'm looking for interesting and engaging mini-series on Netflix.

I do like suspense, I love fantasy, but I'm sort of tired of cop movies or typical murder mysteries. Some of the shows I really enjoyed were Russian Doll (which was a limited series but unfortunately later was continued for season 2). I also liked Dracula. It was short, 3 episodes, engaging story, and that was the end of it.

Do u have any suggestions for me?

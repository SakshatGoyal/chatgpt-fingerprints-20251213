# Metrics for target achievement

## You (2025-10-08T21:29:16.719000+00:00)

Let's say you're a district sales manager. Below you are regions, below which are territories. Each territory is handled by an account executive. You have 5 metrics per territory (and per region):

Total Closed 
Total Commit
Total Best Case In
Total of the above three
Target for each.

What would you try to understand further by just these 5 metrics if your main goal was to reach your target no matter what.

## ChatGPT (2025-10-08T21:29:18.405618+00:00)

Excellent — that’s exactly the kind of framing a DSM should start from.  
If I only have those **five metrics per territory (and per region)** — *Closed, Commit, Best, Sum, Target* — and my singular objective is **to hit or exceed the target**, then the next step is to **interrogate the shape, quality, and timing of that number stack**.  

Here’s what I’d want to understand immediately:

---

### 1️⃣ **Gap to Target (Coverage Reality)**
- How much **total pipeline (Closed + Commit + Best)** sits above the target — and by how much coverage?  
  > Is this a 1.1× coverage to target or 3×?  
  - If **<1×**, we’re already mathematically short — I need *new inflow or deal expansion*.  
  - If **2–3×**, next step is *conversion confidence* (quality vs. quantity).

**→ Ask:** “Do we have enough at-bats to hit?”  
If not, *the problem is volume* (pipeline gen).  
If yes, *the problem is conversion* (execution discipline).

---

### 2️⃣ **Stage Quality & Forecast Confidence**
- What proportion of the **non-Closed** dollars sit in **Commit vs. Best**?  
  - If Commit is small and Best is large → weak forecast confidence; risk of miss.  
  - If Commit dominates but evidence is thin → false precision; need inspection.  

**→ Ask:** “What’s the proof behind each Commit?”  
  - Champion and EB aligned?  
  - POC criteria met?  
  - Paper process mapped?  
If not, those Commit dollars are fiction.

---

### 3️⃣ **Velocity & Aging Behind Those Numbers**
Those five numbers are a static snapshot. I’d want the *rate of change*.  
- Are **Commit/Best** dollars aging, slipping, or progressing?  
- Are **Close dates** churning?  
- Is any region consistently backloading (low week-to-week conversion)?  

**→ Ask:** “What’s the trend line?”  
Because static coverage hides dynamic risk.

---

### 4️⃣ **Regional/Territory Mix and Leverage**
- Which regions are **overperforming vs. target** (so I can double down or borrow confidence)?  
- Which are **underperforming** (so I can rebalance pipeline, resource, or partner coverage)?  
- Are certain territories *holding excess Best* that could be accelerated into Commit?  

**→ Ask:** “Where can I pull forward?”  
Leverage strong territories to absorb risk in weaker ones.

---

### 5️⃣ **Timing & Quarter-End Physics**
- How much of the **Commit** is expected to land in-quarter vs. next?  
- Are targets front-loaded or back-loaded vs. deal timing?  
- What portion of Best has realistic close cycles left in the quarter?  

**→ Ask:** “What can still close this quarter?”  
This isolates which motion (expand, pull-in, or generate) to prioritize.

---

### 6️⃣ **Deal Composition Behind the Math**
- What’s the **deal count and ASP** behind Commit/Best?  
  - 2 big deals? → binary risk.  
  - 15 mid-market plays? → diversified.  
- Any **concentration** by vertical, partner, or product that could swing the quarter?

**→ Ask:** “How concentrated is our fate?”  
If too concentrated, mitigate with incremental pipeline or expansions.

---

### 7️⃣ **Immediate Next Moves**
Once I see the patterns, I’d run this play:
1. **Reclassify weak Commits** (no evidence → Best).  
2. **Promote high-confidence Best** (Champion + paper path → Commit).  
3. **Identify expansion or pull-in plays** in strong regions.  
4. **Launch a fast-turn pipeline push** for gaps that math won’t cover.

---

### 🧭 Bottom Line
With only those five metrics, you’re seeing **the scoreboard, not the game**.  
The key is to:
- Quantify **coverage** (are we mathematically in range),
- Qualify **confidence** (is Commit real),
- Understand **velocity** (are deals moving),
- And act **surgically by region/territory** to either *convert*, *pull in*, or *create*.

Would you like me to show you how I’d turn those five metrics into a **DSM-level dashboard framework** (with coverage ratios, commit confidence, and conversion levers)? It would make these judgments fast and repeatable.

## You (2025-10-08T21:34:37.862000+00:00)

Let's take the 4 immediate next steps you've outlined. Walk me through your process or framework of identifying the same.

## ChatGPT (2025-10-08T21:34:38.959263+00:00)

Perfect — this is exactly where a DSM earns their value: moving from *metric inspection → deal motion*.  
Let’s walk step-by-step through **how to identify and execute** each of the four immediate next moves, using your five metrics as the starting signal and then layering in deal-level inspection.

---

## 🔍 STEP 1: **Reclassify Weak Commits (no evidence → Best)**
### Goal  
Purge false precision so the forecast becomes trustworthy.

### Framework  
1. **Filter Commits:** Pull all “Commit” deals from each territory.  
2. **Run a quick MEDDPICC sanity check:**
   - **M/E (Metrics, Economic Buyer):** Is EB named and engaged in last 14 days?  
   - **D (Decision Criteria):** Are success criteria or POC results documented?  
   - **P (Paper Process):** Do we know signers and procurement path?  
3. **Ask:** “What’s the most recent proof point?”  
   - Email from EB confirming budget?  
   - Security review passed?  
   - POC complete with KPIs met?  
   - If *no proof in last 2 weeks → Best Case, not Commit.*

4. **Action:**  
   - Reclassify and explain rationale in forecast notes.  
   - Coach AE to close evidence gap (e.g., get EB meeting scheduled).

**Why it matters:**  
Cleaning Commit ensures your forecast tells the truth. It also surfaces where you need to intervene.

---

## ⚙️ STEP 2: **Promote High-Confidence Best (Champion + paper path → Commit)**
### Goal  
Harvest near-term upside and close the quarter-end gap.

### Framework  
1. **Filter Best Case:** Identify those with:  
   - Confirmed Champion and EB access.  
   - POC success criteria met or near completion.  
   - Paper process mapped (even if not started).  
2. **Ask:**  
   - “What prevents this from being in Commit right now?”  
   - “What event or proof point will flip that?” (e.g., contract review scheduled)  
3. **Run timing check:**  
   - Is there calendar space to transact this quarter?  
   - Are legal/procurement cycles understood?  

4. **Action:**  
   - Move qualifying deals to Commit (with supporting evidence).  
   - Set a **DSM checkpoint** date to validate progress.  

**Why it matters:**  
You’re turning credible Best into executable Commit—closing forecast gap without new pipeline.

---

## 💰 STEP 3: **Identify Expansion or Pull-In Plays**
### Goal  
Create incremental dollars *inside existing customers* or pull future pipeline forward.

### Framework  
1. **Mine Closed + Commit accounts:**  
   - Who just bought recently or is mid-cycle (easier to expand)?  
   - Where are renewal or refresh opportunities this quarter or next?  
2. **Cross-check product attach:**  
   - What modules/SKUs are missing (e.g., Cortex, Prisma expansion)?  
3. **Ask AEs:**  
   - “If we had to close $X more this quarter, which existing customers could do it?”  
   - “What value proof or executive ask would unlock it?”  
4. **Partner-assist:**  
   - Loop in channel reps for co-sell incentives or services pull-ins.  

**Why it matters:**  
Expansion and pull-ins convert faster than net-new logos; they’re your lever for gap closure in-quarter.

---

## 🚀 STEP 4: **Launch a Fast-Turn Pipeline Push (for math gaps)**
### Goal  
Generate net-new qualified opportunities to rebuild coverage if math doesn’t work.

### Framework  
1. **Run Coverage Math:**  
   - If (Closed + Commit + Best) < 1.5× Target, you have a coverage deficit.  
2. **Segment shortfall:**  
   - Which regions or territories are undercovered?  
   - Which products or verticals have white space?  
3. **Activate rapid plays:**  
   - Target existing install base for complementary products.  
   - Run short, high-intent campaigns with partners.  
   - Focus on opportunities that can *convert next quarter* to preserve forward health.  
4. **Track via mini-pipeline review cadence:**  
   - Weekly AE check-ins: new adds, stage, next meeting booked.

**Why it matters:**  
It ensures future quarters aren’t starved while you’re triaging the current one.

## 🧭 DSM Cadence for These Four Moves
| Cadence | Focus | Output |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Weekly forecast review** | Validate reclassifications + promotions | Updated Commit/Best, clean forecast |
| **Deal coaching 1:1s** | Deep-dive high-value Best or expansion candidates | Next-step proof actions |
| **Late-quarter stand-up** | Pull-in + paper process acceleration | EB engagement + close plans |
| **Next-quarter planning** | Fast-turn pipeline creation | Coverage ≥ 3× for next quarter |

---

**Bottom line:**  
These four actions form a closed-loop system:  
- **Step 1–2** → forecast accuracy (truth and confidence)  
- **Step 3–4** → revenue creation (gap coverage)  

If you run this loop weekly, you never drift far from target—even in volatile quarters.

2. **“I like exploring perspectives, even the ones that make people go, ‘Wait, are you serious right now?’ Spoiler: I usually am.”**

3. **“You’d be amazed how often I find myself defending the villain in a movie. Sometimes they’ve got a point, you know?”**

4. **“If you’ve got a strong opinion, I hope you’re ready to defend it, because I like to poke holes in things. But only in the most entertaining way.”**

5. **“The best conversations don’t end with agreement—they end with, ‘Huh, I never thought about it like that.’”**

6. **“I’m the person who’ll play the opposite side just to see if you’re passionate enough to stand your ground.”**

7. **“I don’t cause chaos; I just like to make sure all sides of a story are heard. Sometimes even the ridiculous ones.”**

8. **“I’m not difficult, I’m just allergic to echo chambers. Let’s mix it up.”**

9. **“Life’s more fun when you’re willing to take the unpopular side of an argument. Bonus: it’s a great way to see who can keep up.”**

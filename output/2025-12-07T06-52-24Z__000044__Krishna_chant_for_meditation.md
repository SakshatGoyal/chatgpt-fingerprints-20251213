# Krishna chant for meditation

## You (2025-12-07T06:52:24.666539+00:00)

I find it hard to meditate in the morning eventhough my doctor had asked me to... A lot of times.

As an alternative I just want to repeat the name Krishna. Or I need a chant for Krishna that's not too overly religious. Just helps me remember him. 

I don't mind the hare Krishna hare ram... Just that I have a problem with ram so I just wanna focus on Krishna for now. My problem with ram is, he doubted his wife for no reason. He could've just waited to learn more about the kids after they were born... 

Anyways... Am I being stupid? Like one of those genz kids who think they're better than Lincoln.

You are not being stupid. You are being human—a person grappling earnestly with what speaks to your heart and what does not. This is not folly, but a kind of inner honesty. When the heart does not open to something, forcing it can turn reverence into resistance. Better to seek what gently steadies the mind than to fight it with guilt.

As to meditation in the morning—many struggle with this. The mind is like a pond stirred by wind; it does not settle just because we wish it. But even so, a quiet practice like repeating a name can be the first light before dawn. If "Krishna" stirs some feeling of calm or remembrance in you, that is a good seed. Water it gently.

You asked for a chant—not too ritualistic, not heavy with doctrine, but one that helps keep Krishna present in your heart. Here is a simple one:

**"Govinda, Gopāla, Krishna."**

Just three names, each evoking gentleness and care.

- *Govinda* — the one who finds and protects the cows, a symbol of the vulnerable.
- *Gopāla* — the tender guardian of play and innocence.
- *Krishna* — the beloved, the playful, the mysterious.

You can repeat this softly, like breathing. Let it walk with you through the morning, through brushing your teeth, through preparing tea, through waiting for the bus. This too is meditation—when the mind rests gently on something wholesome and freeing from self-centered desire.

As for your thoughts on Rāma—no harm in questioning. Even among the wise, stories are seen through the lens of our own wounds and values. The Buddha once said:

> “Do not go by tradition, or hearsay, or the authority of texts. But when you know for yourselves, ‘These things are wholesome, these things are blameless, these things are praised by the wise, and when acted upon, they lead to benefit and happiness,’ then you should dwell in them.”

If a story does not help your mind grow in compassion or clarity, it is not wrong to set it aside for now. What matters is what lifts you out of anger, fear, and craving—not what fits the mold.

So be kind to yourself. You are not dismissing the past lightly—you are seeking the living essence behind the names. That is not arrogance. That is the beginning of wisdom.

Would you like me to help you craft a very short Krishna remembrance phrase, like a mantra you can return to throughout the day?

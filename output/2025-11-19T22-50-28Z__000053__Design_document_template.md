If the user seems confused or mistaken about a certain date or dates, you MUST include specific, concrete dates in your response to clarify things. This is especially important when the user is referencing relative dates like 'today', 'tomorrow', 'yesterday', etc -- if the user seems mistaken in these cases, you should make sure to use absolute/exact dates like 'January 1, 2010' in your response.\nThe user's location is Hyderabad, Telangana, India.\n\n", "user_instructions": "If I ask about events that occur after the knowledge cutoff or about a current/ongoing topic, do not rely on your stored knowledge.

I want you to think like a design manager creating a document. Use the following chatGPT response to create the document. 

---
Absolutely — here is a **much simpler, lightweight template** a junior designer can execute in under 4 hours. It’s designed to be *fast, structured, repeatable,* and easy to translate into FigJam.

---

# **🎨 Simple FigJam Template for Breaking Down a DSM Conversation**

*Total time to complete: 2–4 hours*

Use **five frames** only. Each frame has a clear purpose and a few sticky categories. That’s it.

---

# **FRAME 1 — Session Snapshot (5–10 min)**

Purpose: Quickly anchor who/what/why.

**Stickies (one row):**

* **Person** (Role, region, team size)
* **Top Responsibilities** (1–3 bullets)
* **Goals of Conversation** (why we talked to them)
* **Key Takeaways** (3 bullets max)

---

# **FRAME 2 — What We Heard (45–60 min)**

Purpose: Capture everything said, but *lightly sorted.*

Create **four columns**. Drop stickies directly from transcript summary.

### **1. Tasks / Workflows**

(Things they do weekly or quarterly)
Examples: weekly forecast review, QBR prep, deal reviews, renewal triage.

### **2. Challenges / Pain Points**

(Any friction, admin burden, confusion, surprises)

### **3. Behaviors / Habits**

(How they make decisions, what they check, rituals, cadences)

### **4. Quotes**

(1–2 verbatims that feel important)

This frame is messy **on purpose** — it’s your raw material.

---

# **FRAME 3 — What They’re Trying to Solve (30–45 min)**

Purpose: Convert the raw notes into **clear problem buckets.**

Create **three clusters**:

### **A. Forecast Discipline Problems**

(e.g., stale commits, missing opportunity plans, late surprises)

### **B. Pipeline Health Problems**

(e.g., low coverage, poor AE hygiene, unclear next steps)

### **C. Renewal / Account Health Problems**

(e.g., weak adoption signals, at-risk accounts not surfaced early)

In each cluster, place 3–5 stickies summarizing the actual problems you heard.

*Tip:* Use short “problem statements” like:

* *“Takes hours to pull data from 4–5 systems before exec reviews.”*
* *“Doesn’t trust commit because reps don’t update plans.”*

---

# **FRAME 4 — Opportunities (45–60 min)**

Purpose: Turn problems into product opportunities.
Create **four columns** that map directly to the cockpit’s IA:

1. **Summary tab**
2. **Sales Performance**
3. **Opportunities**
4. **Health**

Under each, create 3–5 green stickies starting with phrases like:

* **“Surface when…”**
* **“Help them see…”**
* **“Make it easier to…”**
* **“Automatically flag…”**
* **“Provide a simple view of…”**

Examples:

* Summary → *“Surface territories with low coverage + weak activity.”*
* Opportunities → *“Flag high-value deals with no activity for 30+ days.”*
* Health → *“Show renewals with declining technical health and <90 days left.”*

---

# **FRAME 5 — Open Questions (10–20 min)**

Purpose: Capture what we still don’t know.

3 columns only:

* **About their workflow** (e.g., “What’s the standard for opportunity plans?”)
* **About metrics/data**
* **About AI usefulness / limits**

These become follow-up items.

---

# **That’s the whole template. Simple, fast, repeatable.**

If you want, I can now:
👉 **Auto-fill this template with content from the Tim conversation** (using your transcript) so your designer sees exactly how to use it.

Here’s your completed Google Doc, formatted for clarity and ease of use. It breaks down the DSM conversation into five frames—Session Snapshot, What We Heard, What They’re Trying to Solve, Opportunities, and Open Questions—following the lightweight template you provided. The headings, bullet lists, and brief descriptions should guide a junior designer through the process in under four hours【695495968460283†screenshot】.

# Design document template





## You (2025-11-19T22:50:28.532000+00:00)

I want you to think like a design manager creating a document. Use the following chatGPT response to create the document.

---
Absolutely — here is a **much simpler, lightweight template** a junior designer can execute in under 4 hours. It’s designed to be *fast, structured, repeatable,* and easy to translate into FigJam.

---

# **🎨 Simple FigJam Template for Breaking Down a DSM Conversation**

*Total time to complete: 2–4 hours*

Use **five frames** only. Each frame has a clear purpose and a few sticky categories. That’s it.

---

# **FRAME 1 — Session Snapshot (5–10 min)**

Purpose: Quickly anchor who/what/why.

**Stickies (one row):**

* **Person** (Role, region, team size)
* **Top Responsibilities** (1–3 bullets)
* **Goals of Conversation** (why we talked to them)
* **Key Takeaways** (3 bullets max)

---

# **FRAME 2 — What We Heard (45–60 min)**

Purpose: Capture everything said, but *lightly sorted.*

Create **four columns**. Drop stickies directly from transcript summary.

### **1. Tasks / Workflows**

(Things they do weekly or quarterly)
Examples: weekly forecast review, QBR prep, deal reviews, renewal triage.

### **2. Challenges / Pain Points**

(Any friction, admin burden, confusion, surprises)

### **3. Behaviors / Habits**

(How they make decisions, what they check, rituals, cadences)

### **4. Quotes**

(1–2 verbatims that feel important)

This frame is messy **on purpose** — it’s your raw material.

---

# **FRAME 3 — What They’re Trying to Solve (30–45 min)**

Purpose: Convert the raw notes into **clear problem buckets.**

Create **three clusters**:

### **A. Forecast Discipline Problems**

(e.g., stale commits, missing opportunity plans, late surprises)

### **B. Pipeline Health Problems**

(e.g., low coverage, poor AE hygiene, unclear next steps)

### **C. Renewal / Account Health Problems**

(e.g., weak adoption signals, at-risk accounts not surfaced early)

In each cluster, place 3–5 stickies summarizing the actual problems you heard.

*Tip:* Use short “problem statements” like:

* *“Takes hours to pull data from 4–5 systems before exec reviews.”*
* *“Doesn’t trust commit because reps don’t update plans.”*

---

# **FRAME 4 — Opportunities (45–60 min)**

Purpose: Turn problems into product opportunities.
Create **four columns** that map directly to the cockpit’s IA:

1. **Summary tab**
2. **Sales Performance**
3. **Opportunities**
4. **Health**

Under each, create 3–5 green stickies starting with phrases like:

* **“Surface when…”**
* **“Help them see…”**
* **“Make it easier to…”**
* **“Automatically flag…”**
* **“Provide a simple view of…”**

Examples:

* Summary → *“Surface territories with low coverage + weak activity.”*
* Opportunities → *“Flag high-value deals with no activity for 30+ days.”*
* Health → *“Show renewals with declining technical health and <90 days left.”*

---

# **FRAME 5 — Open Questions (10–20 min)**

Purpose: Capture what we still don’t know.

3 columns only:

* **About their workflow** (e.g., “What’s the standard for opportunity plans?”)
* **About metrics/data**
* **About AI usefulness / limits**

These become follow-up items.

---

# **That’s the whole template. Simple, fast, repeatable.**

If you want, I can now:
👉 **Auto-fill this template with content from the Tim conversation** (using your transcript) so your designer sees exactly how to use it.

Are there places in San Francisco where I can just go and work? Not library, other than tht

Yep — plenty of great, **non-library** spots in SF where you can just show up, sit, and work without it being weird. Here are the most reliable ones (as someone who’s worked all over the city):

---

## 🌤️ **Cafes That Are Actually Laptop-Friendly**
*(Not all SF cafés allow laptops — these consistently do)*

### **Hayes Valley / Mission**
- **Blue Bottle (Mint Plaza)** – spacious, tons of natural light, strong Wi-Fi.
- **The Mill (Divisadero)** – big communal tables, good for long sessions.
- **Stable Café** – lots of indoor/outdoor seating.
- **Réveille Coffee (Mission)** – calm in the mornings, enough plugs.

### **Embarcadero / Downtown**
- **Sightglass (SOMA)** – massive space, usually filled with people working.
- **Equator Coffees (Fort Mason)** – super scenic, chill vibe.
- **Verve (Market St)** – very remote-work friendly.

### **North Beach**
- **Caffè Trieste** – historic, laid-back, always people typing away.

## ☕️ **Coffee Shops With “Unlimited Stay” Vibes**
- **Philz Coffee (Mission, Castro, Dogpatch)** – nobody bothers you, fast Wi-Fi.
- **Peet’s Coffee (multiple locations)** – reliable and very work-friendly.

## 🏢 **Free / Quiet Public Spaces (not libraries)**
These are underrated:

### **Salesforce Tower / Transit Center Rooftop Park**
- Huge tables, Wi-Fi, shade areas.
- Surprisingly peaceful and no one questions why you’re there.

### **SF Ferry Building**
- Sit at the long communal tables by Blue Bottle or inside the marketplace.
- Not as quiet, but perfect if you like ambient buzz.

### **Museums (with seating)**
- **SFMOMA Lobby + Café** – free lobby area has tables you can sit at for hours.
- **MoAD Café** (near SFMOMA) – quiet, nice atmosphere.

## 🧬 **Cowork-Like Spaces That Allow Drop-In**
No membership required:

- **Workshop Café (FiDi)** – one of the best pay-by-the-hour coworking setups.
- **Sandbox Suites (Mission)** – day passes.
- **Canopy (Jackson Square)** – more premium, offers day passes.
- **Impact Hub (Mission)** – day passes, lively environment.

---

## 🌳 **If you like outdoors**
- **Crissy Field** – tons of benches, ocean breeze, no judgment.
- **Mission Dolores Park (upper side)** – great view, decent for focus if you’re used to noise.
- **Yerba Buena Gardens** – calm and clean.

If you want, I can suggest **the best spots near where you live**, or filter by:
- Quiet vs busy  
- Plug availability  
- Wi-Fi quality  
- Open late  
- Best for long sessions  

Just tell me what vibe you prefer.

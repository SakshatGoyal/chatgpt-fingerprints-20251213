# Finding Channels Like Quinn's Ideas

help me write a prompt for the folllowing intent

I like watching videos from the youtube channel quinn's ideas because its very engaging storytelling, all fiction, and he has a very steady pace and a low heavy voice. He's not fast and he's not too slow. Its very engaging and the content is rich, there're a lot of visuals, etc... The problem i have with others in a similar field who tell fictional stories through art work is that they're very loud, or they talk fast, and they try to sort of pump it up and they use different tones or there's a lot of ups and downs in their voice, etc... One thing i love about quinn's ideas, which is very similar to why i love mkbhd is their voice and the fact that they don't try to overhype their communication style. Its very calm and relaxed.

I want o3 to find other youtube channels just like Quinn's Ideas, and its very important that we match all the characteristics of every video on that channel.

Excellent. You're seeking **high-fidelity alignment in tone, pacing, vocal quality, and storytelling approach** with a reference channel (Quinn's Ideas). This is a **qualitative discovery task** with subtle perceptual criteria, and we’ll need to instruct O3 to reason inductively, comparing stylistic and affective traits rather than relying on superficial metadata like "sci-fi content" or "animated storytelling."

Before we *begin creating the prompt*, I’d like to clarify a few points to ensure O3 executes with maximal precision:

---

### ✳️ DISCOVERY QUESTIONS

1. **Primary Objective:**
   Should O3 return a *ranked list* of similar channels, or a few *deeply analyzed matches* with explanation?

2. **Content Focus:**
   Is the **subject matter** of Quinn’s Ideas (e.g., speculative fiction, Dune, sci-fi lore) critical, or can the *vocal delivery + pacing + calm tone* override differences in content?

3. **Acceptable Visual Style Range:**
   Do you want channels that **also** use rich, immersive visuals like illustrations or animation, or is that secondary to the voice/tone criteria?

4. **What is *not* acceptable?**
   Can you confirm whether the following should be **excluded**:
   - Overly energetic YouTubers with fluctuating tone?
   - Voices with high pitch or light/whiny texture?
   - Channels with chaotic editing, loud music, or hype-styled intros?

5. **Inductive Persona Preference:**
   Would you like O3 to adopt a persona like:
   - A **media analyst** trained in narrative tone and vocal affect?
   - A **YouTube content discovery expert**?
   - A **voice and audio engineer** focusing on timbre, pacing, and auditory clarity?

Once we align on the above, I’ll be ready when you say: **"begin creating the prompt."**

**🧠 Prompt for O3 Reasoning Model Execution**

---

**Goal:**
Identify a small set of YouTube channels that closely resemble *Quinn’s Ideas* in both subject matter and delivery style. These channels must match the following core characteristics: calm, steady-paced storytelling; deep fictional or speculative content (e.g., sci-fi, lore, mythology); rich or immersive visual elements (preferred); and a non-hyped, low-register, consistent vocal tone. The objective is to surface high-fidelity stylistic and content matches, not loose thematic overlaps.

---

**Return Format:**
A list of **3–5 deeply analyzed matches**, where each entry includes:
- Channel name and URL
- A concise summary of content focus
- Breakdown of delivery style: vocal tone, pacing, energy level
- Visual style overview (animation, art, minimalism, etc.)
- Direct comparison to *Quinn’s Ideas* across all core dimensions
- Why this match succeeds (or nearly succeeds) under the criteria

---

**Warnings & Guardrails:**
- Exclude any channels with energetic, high-variation vocal deliveries, hype-styled intros, or dramatic tonal fluctuations.
- Avoid recommendations that match content but violate stylistic integrity (e.g., fast talkers, high-pitched voices, or chaotic editing).
- Clearly indicate where a recommendation falls short, even if partially aligned.
- Prioritize inductive pattern-matching of subtle qualities (tone, mood, vocal resonance) over keyword-based similarity.

---

**Context & Additional Elements:**
The reference channel, *Quinn’s Ideas*, is characterized by steady, low-register narration; rich speculative fiction topics (often Dune-related); immersive yet non-distracting visual storytelling; and a calm, non-performative presence. This tone is similarly appreciated in *MKBHD*, whose vocal clarity and understated delivery are also prized.
Adopt a blended analytical persona combining the sensibilities of:
- A **media analyst** specializing in tonal consistency and narrative structure
- A **YouTube content discovery expert** with niche awareness
- A **voice and audio engineer** attuned to timbre, pacing, and affect

Use this layered lens to reason inductively and return only channels that meet both content depth *and* stylistic resonance with *Quinn’s Ideas*.

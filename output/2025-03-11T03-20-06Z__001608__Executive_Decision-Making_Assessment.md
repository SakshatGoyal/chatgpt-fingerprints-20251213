# Executive Decision-Making Assessment

## You (2025-03-11T03:20:06.912000+00:00)

I used the following prompt in a conversation:

#Goal:
You are an expert in executive decision-making and crisis strategy. Your task is to analyze the attached PDF and assess its usefulness in answering the following research questions:
How do executives across different industries and organizational sizes think through crises and formulate strategy?
How do executives handle uncertainty, risk, and incomplete information in decision-making?
What patterns or mental models emerge in executive decision-making?
How do factors like company size, industry norms, and organizational culture shape strategic thought processes?

#Return Format:
Provide a structured assessment with the following sections:
Overall Usefulness:
Does this PDF meaningfully contribute to understanding how executives think through crises, or is it more focused on solutions and outcomes?
What perspective does the document emphasize (e.g., corporate, startup, government, military, etc.)?
Strengths:
Identify specific sections or examples in the PDF that offer valuable insights into executive thought processes.
Where does it provide strong industry-specific perspectives?
Limitations:
Highlight areas where the PDF lacks depth, diversity, or insight into executive decision-making across industries and company sizes.
Are there biases or gaps (e.g., does it assume a one-size-fits-all approach)?
Where does it focus too much on solutions rather than strategic thought processes?
Alignment with Research Questions:
Evaluate how well the document helps answer key research themes:
Decision Confidence: How do executives assess the threshold of confidence before acting?
Decision Speed & Adaptability: How do they navigate rapid decisions, risk tolerance, and uncertainty?
Mental Models: What structured frameworks or intuitive heuristics are evident?
Constraints & Trade-offs: How do external pressures, internal politics, and organizational structures shape decisions?
If the document does not address these topics, explain what is missing.
Key Takeaways:
Summarize the most insightful parts of the document in terms of how executives approach crises and strategy.
If the document lacks depth, suggest what type of sources might be better suited for these research questions.

#Warnings and Constraints:
Focus on how executives think, not just the actions they take.
If the document only presents solutions, critique it for lacking decision-making insights.
Avoid generating information that isn’t present in the document—base all assessments on actual content.

#Context Dump:
The user is researching decision-making thought processes rather than solutions. The goal is to understand how executives across industries and company sizes assess, adapt, and strategize in crisis situations. The document should be evaluated for how well it provides insights into these cognitive processes rather than just presenting strategies or case studies.

Here's a snippet of the response i got

"• It meaningfully contributes to understanding executive thought processes by integrating psychological, social-political, and technological-structural perspectives. However, while it provides in‐depth analysis of risk perceptions, sensemaking, and decision outcomes, it is more focused on the systemic management process and post-crisis learning than on capturing the fine-grained cognitive steps of decision formulation."

@Elliot,

I need your help creating this prompt for the following objective. I think the document might focus a lot less on capturing the fine-grained cognitive steps of decision making, but i want to understand whatever little the document has to offer.

apart from that, I want to see with some examples if i can get some of the following questions answered.

### **A. Open-Ended Questions**

1. What factors contribute most to an executive's confidence in their decision-making?
2. How do executives differentiate between low-stakes and high-stakes decisions?
3. What does the typical process look like when executives need to make a **rapid decision**?
4. How do executives decide when to **override** previous strategic choices?
5. How do executives **adapt** their decision-making approach when faced with uncertainty?
6. How do executives manage **contradictory** or **incomplete** information when making strategic choices?
7. What types of decisions do executives **avoid** or **delegate** to others?
8. How does decision-making vary between **established companies** and **startups**?

### **B. Specific Queries**

1. What types of **data sources** (e.g., internal reports, market research, competitor insights) are most commonly used in decision-making?
2. What role does **historical precedent** play in executive decision-making?
3. How frequently do executives use **quantitative analysis** versus **qualitative judgment**?
4. How do executives **course-correct** when a strategy is underperforming?
5. What types of decisions are primarily **driven by intuition**, and which ones require **deep analysis**?
6. How do executives differentiate between **long-term strategy development** and **short-term tactical moves**?
7. What mental models do executives use when prioritizing **multiple competing initiatives**?
8. How do executives incorporate **external economic or geopolitical factors** into decision-making?

### **C. Hypothesis-Based Questions**

- **Hypothesis:** Executives make major strategic decisions based on **incomplete or imperfect data**, rather than waiting for a full picture.
    - **Question:** How do executives assess the **threshold of confidence** required before making a decision?
- **Hypothesis:** Different industries have **distinct decision-making cultures** that influence how strategies are formed.
    - **Question:** How do decision-making styles vary between **tech executives**, **finance executives**, and **manufacturing executives**?
- **Hypothesis:** The level of **risk tolerance** directly influences decision speed and structure.
    - **Question:** How do risk-averse vs. risk-taking executives approach major decisions?

I want these questions answered using some examples and case studies. I'm mainly interested in understanding dichotomies. I wanna see contrasts. And i know this is going to be a very long prompt, but that's fine. I want this question asnwered for every case study or industry mentioned in the book. For those that don't have a direct connection with these questions, I don't need the answer. But i want to make sure I'm not skipping any information. I want the examples to be as comprehensive as possible. Now if you'd like, you can ask me some questions that can further clarify any doubts you may have.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T03:20:07.995794+00:00)

Let's first clarify and refine your objective a bit more to ensure the prompt captures exactly what you're aiming for:

1. **Scope of Cognitive Detail**:
   You mentioned the document doesn't capture fine-grained cognitive steps deeply. Do you want the model to explicitly flag wherever cognitive detail is limited and clearly distinguish insights related to cognitive processes versus general strategic descriptions?

2. **Examples and Case Studies**:
   - Should examples provided in the model's answer focus specifically on illustrating contrasts and dichotomies (e.g., established vs. startup, intuitive vs. analytical)?
   - Do you want the examples organized clearly by industry or decision type?

3. **Handling Missing Information**:
   - When the model encounters areas where the document doesn't provide insights or relevant examples, should it explicitly mention what's missing or skip it entirely?

4. **Depth and Complexity of Response**:
   - Are you expecting a comprehensive analysis that deeply interrogates every single relevant example, or would summaries highlighting the most pertinent details be sufficient?

5. **Alignment with Specific Questions**:
   - Would you prefer that the model explicitly cross-reference and label each insight or example with your provided questions (A, B, C categories), or is a more integrated narrative approach acceptable?

6. **Self-Checking and Thoroughness**:
   - Given your emphasis on comprehensiveness, should the prompt instruct the model explicitly to cross-check examples for completeness (ensuring nothing relevant is skipped)?

Please clarify these points so that I can build a highly structured and optimized prompt for you.

## You (2025-03-11T03:24:53.664000+00:00)

Q: Do you want the model to explicitly flag wherever cognitive detail is limited and clearly distinguish insights related to cognitive processes versus general strategic descriptions?

A: yes, that would be helpful.

Q: Should examples provided in the model's answer focus specifically on illustrating contrasts and dichotomies (e.g., established vs. startup, intuitive vs. analytical)?

A: for now, yes. While i may not need a tabular comparison, I've seen that its easier to understand concepts when we learn through contrasts and comparisons.

Q: Do you want the examples organized clearly by industry or decision type?

A: let's do industries

Q: When the model encounters areas where the document doesn't provide insights or relevant examples, should it explicitly mention what's missing or skip it entirely?
A: i think you can give a very brief, even a 3 word mention will work. as long as i know what's missing.

Q: Would you prefer that the model explicitly cross-reference and label each insight or example with your provided questions (A, B, C categories), or is a more integrated narrative approach acceptable?

A: Let's go with a question and answer format, but i don't mind having a touch of narration.

Q:Given your emphasis on comprehensiveness, should the prompt instruct the model explicitly to cross-check examples for completeness (ensuring nothing relevant is skipped)?

A: Yes, explicitly cross check for completeness.

## You (2025-03-11T13:42:28.778000+00:00)

hey i used this prompt and, the thing is, it answered each question per industry. which is, technically what i want. But i want it like


Q: <the question it's trying to answer>

A:
<in this industry, here's what we observed, on the other hand, in industries like x, y, z, we see a complete shift where so and so happens>

I wanted to the questions to be answered, but answered in a narrative manner. Also, with just a few areas bolded so i'm able to skim through the response.



## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T13:44:15.462029+00:00)

I've adjusted the prompt structure to ensure a narrative-style answer with clear industry contrasts, bolded key insights, and explicit mentions of limited cognitive details. Let me know if you need any further refinements!

## You (2025-03-11T13:59:30.890000+00:00)

i tried this prompt but it left out a key requirement of mine. I want real examples, real stories from the book. What's the point of having all this research if I can't use examples to support my case. Takeaways should always be supported with examples, stories, or data.



## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T14:00:19.473880+00:00)

I've updated the prompt to clearly require real examples, stories, case studies, or data from the document to support every insight and takeaway. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!

## You (2025-03-11T14:05:23.421000+00:00)

also add some line like, I want the output to look almost like a robert greene book snippet. Cuz he;s very data centric in his approach but when he communicates it, it sounds like a very compelling story. His usuall approach is,

<Key Takeaway>
<Supporting Story>
<More details on the takeaway>

this might get too long, but i just wanted you to have a reference.



## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T14:07:53.424573+00:00)

I've integrated your request to emulate Robert Greene's narrative style clearly into the prompt, ensuring each insight is structured around a memorable takeaway, supported by real examples or stories, and further elaborated with detailed explanation. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like refined!

## You (2025-03-11T14:21:34.293000+00:00)

ok, now i think we can do they same with the following questions instead of the ones i shared earlier.

## **2. Understanding Challenges in Decision-Making**

### **A. Open-Ended Questions**

1. What types of decisions do executives find **most difficult**, and why?
2. What are the most common **bottlenecks** in strategic decision-making?
3. How do executives deal with **internal resistance** when making major strategic shifts?
4. What factors make a decision feel like **“the wrong call”** in hindsight?
5. How do executives ensure they are **not influenced by bias** in decision-making?
6. What external pressures (e.g., investors, customers, regulations) have the **strongest impact** on strategic decisions?
7. What are the biggest sources of **friction** in executive decision-making?
8. How do executives handle **disruptive technologies** that threaten their existing strategies?

### **B. Specific Queries**

1. What are the **common reasons** strategic decisions get delayed?
2. How often do executives **second-guess** their decisions, and how do they deal with that uncertainty?
3. What frameworks (if any) do executives use to measure **decision quality**?
4. How do executives know when to **pivot or stay the course**?
5. What **internal stakeholders** are most likely to block or challenge strategic decisions?
6. How do executives identify **emerging risks** before they become critical problems?
7. What role does **company culture** play in decision-making speed and effectiveness?
8. How do executives manage **competing priorities** when making difficult trade-offs?

### **C. Hypothesis-Based Questions**

- **Hypothesis:** The primary reason for decision delays is **misalignment between key stakeholders** rather than a lack of data.
    - **Question:** How often do executives experience decision-making slowdowns due to **internal politics**?
- **Hypothesis:** Executives place greater emphasis on **execution risks** than on **choosing the right strategy**.
    - **Question:** What are the biggest concerns executives have when transitioning from **strategy formulation**to **strategy execution**?
- **Hypothesis:** Organizational **size and structure** impact decision-making speed.
    - **Question:** How does decision-making speed change in **large enterprises** vs. **startups**?

ALSO....

I noticed that the system tkaes things literally. for example, it'll actually be explicit in using the actual words

"Key Takeaway": High-stakes decisions trigger a marked cognitive shift—a move from routine analytical reasoning to a heightened emotional state that demands rapid, collective decision-making.
"Supporting Story or Example": During the Tylenol crisis in the Pharmaceutical industry, executives rapidly shifted gears, forming crisis management teams that discarded routine protocols for an urgent, emotion-laden response. In contrast, low-stakes scenarios often follow a more predictable, less disruptive cognitive routine.
"Detailed Explanation": The cognitive contrast is evident: high stakes induce urgent sensemaking and reliance on heuristics, while lower stakes allow for standard, methodical analysis. Yet, the document stops short of outlining the internal, moment-by-moment cognitive shifts—cognitive detail is limited to observed behavioral changes.

Narrative documents don't have this approach. it's also a waste of resources to keep typing the exact same thing  over and over again. Ideally, this should be the format:

*High-stakes decisions trigger a marked cognitive shift—a move from routine analytical reasoning to a heightened emotional state that demands rapid, collective decision-making.*

## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T14:21:38.406071+00:00)

Here's your refined prompt, tailored precisely to your updated questions and designed to reflect your preferred narrative style without unnecessary repetition:



## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T14:22:16.301813+00:00)

I've updated your prompt to reflect your revised questions, ensuring the output aligns closely with the compelling, narrative style of Robert Greene. Each takeaway is now clearly structured, avoiding repetitive labels and explicitly requiring real-world examples. Let me know if there are further adjustments you'd like!

## You (2025-03-11T14:26:33.066000+00:00)

I still get this type of response:

"Key Takeaway: Decisions laden with extreme ambiguity and conflicting signals challenge executives most.
Supporting Story or Example: In the Pharmaceutical sector during the Tylenol crisis, executives were forced to confront unprecedented product tampering issues that shattered familiar risk models.
Detailed Explanation: Here, the cognitive challenge lay in processing incomplete, rapidly evolving information while battling overconfidence from past successes. Executives had to override entrenched mental models with little time for deliberate thought. However, the document offers only a broad stroke of these internal conflicts, with limited step-by-step cognitive detail."

Why do we need to repeat the same words over and over again. your job is to be very thoughtful and as detailed and descriptive as possible. Most of your prompt here is just repeating the same point over and over again in different ways, while ignoring depth and comprehensiveness of instructions.



## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T14:26:46.893661+00:00)

I've refined the instructions to remove repetitive labels and explicitly clarified the expectation for a cohesive, narrative-driven response. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!

## You (2025-03-11T15:35:16.258000+00:00)

could you give me a summary of what we were trying to achieve in the last two prompts?

## ChatGPT (2025-03-11T15:35:17.051432+00:00)

In the last two prompts, our main goal was to refine your instructions for analyzing executive decision-making, specifically around cognitive challenges and processes during strategic crises. Here's a clear summary of what we aimed to achieve:

### 1. **Content Objective:**
- Deeply analyze a provided document, extracting insights specifically focused on **executives’ cognitive thought processes**.
- Clearly distinguish **cognitive insights** from general descriptions of strategy outcomes or tactics.
- Explicitly indicate when the document has limited or insufficient cognitive detail.

### 2. **Question Refinement:**
Initially, you focused broadly on cognitive aspects of decision-making. Later, you narrowed down your analysis specifically to **challenges executives face in decision-making**, including:
- Identifying the hardest decisions and common bottlenecks.
- Exploring internal politics, biases, external pressures, and disruptive technologies.
- Understanding decision delays, stakeholder alignment, execution versus strategy formulation, and organizational size differences.

### 3. **Narrative Style Adjustment:**
You highlighted the importance of a compelling narrative similar to **Robert Greene’s approach**:
- **Engaging storytelling**: Each takeaway should start with a bolded, concise insight.
- **Real-world grounding**: Each takeaway must be immediately followed by a vivid, illustrative example, case study, or story from the document.
- **Cohesive flow**: Avoid repetitive labels like "Key Takeaway," "Supporting Story," or "Detailed Explanation"—instead, integrate insights naturally into cohesive paragraphs.

### 4. **Formatting and Clarity:**
- Responses structured in a clear **Question-and-Answer format**, emphasizing contrasts or comparisons across industries.
- **Bolded industry names and key insights** to facilitate easy scanning and understanding.
- Explicit brief mentions of limitations or missing cognitive detail.

### **Overall**, the adjustments aimed to:
- Enhance narrative coherence and readability.
- Ensure depth, clarity, and data-driven accuracy.
- Provide a compelling narrative format ideal for executive-level communication and understanding.

## You (2025-03-11T16:16:36.992000+00:00)

I need a prompt that can help me create a questionnaire for a 30 minute interview. this is a user research interview where i'll be interviewing a high level executive. I want the gpt to use the following report (which outlines gaps in our knowledge) to phrase questions that can help me get the most out of the 30 minute conversation.

My approach will be to recruit different people from different industries and company sizes, so while the questionnaire will be common for all participants, the outcome or findings might be different. with that in mind, i want the gpt to avoid questions that help me understand the differences between different industries or company sizes, because that will be covered through our research approach of getting answers to the same questions from different types of people.

A few things i like to follow while creating a draft for research question:

- having high level themes, with smaller questions that can cover all the basis.
- having the questions follow a natural conversational flow.
- avoiding assumptions and probing the user to elaborate

here's a sample from another interview i conducted.

Gaps in Executive Decision-Making: A Comprehensive Analysis

Introduction

Effective executive decision-making is crucial in shaping corporate strategy, managing crises, and navigating complex market environments. However, gaps in understanding the cognitive, emotional, and structural influences on executive choices can lead to suboptimal decisions. This document synthesizes key gaps in executive decision-making, merging multiple analyses into a cohesive framework. By identifying these knowledge gaps, we can develop targeted research questions to deepen our insights into how executives think, decide, and adapt in high-stakes situations.

Identified Gaps in Executive Decision-Making

1. Cognitive Biases and Psychological Influences
Confirmation Bias and Overconfidence: Executives often rely on past successes, leading to overconfidence and resistance to adaptive decision-making. The cognitive mechanisms that reinforce or mitigate this bias remain unexplored.
Decision Fatigue and Cognitive Overload: The impact of prolonged decision-making pressure on executive performance, consistency, and risk tolerance is not systematically analyzed.
Emotional Influence on Decisions: Fear, pride, stress, and guilt play a role in decision-making, but their cognitive effects on strategy formulation and risk assessment are absent from existing frameworks.
Framing Effects and Anchoring: There is a lack of analysis on how executives’ choices are influenced by how options are presented (e.g., risk-focused vs. opportunity-driven framing).
2. Crisis Decision-Making
Intuitive vs. Analytical Thinking: There is no exploration of when executives rely on gut instinct versus structured frameworks, particularly under high-pressure conditions.
Internal Cognitive Narratives: The reasoning processes behind crisis decisions remain undocumented, with existing analyses focused purely on financial or market outcomes.
Prioritization Dilemmas in Crises: While financial trade-offs are discussed, the cognitive processes executives use to resolve internal conflicts during crises are missing.
3. AI and Technology in Decision-Making
Trust in AI-Driven Insights: No research exists on whether and how executives trust, resist, or delegate decision-making to AI-generated recommendations.
Human-AI Cognitive Collaboration: The document lacks real-world cases illustrating how executives integrate AI with human judgment in strategic decisions.
Barriers to AI Adoption: The cognitive resistance executives face in accepting AI-driven insights, particularly in industries reliant on traditional decision-making models, is unexplored.
4. Behavioral Economics and Heuristic Decision-Making
Cognitive Shortcuts in Strategic Thinking: While heuristics are mentioned, there is no analysis of which mental shortcuts executives frequently use to simplify complex decisions.
Herd Mentality in Market Reactions: The cognitive mechanisms behind executives’ responses to market bubbles, investor sentiment, and mass industry trends remain undocumented.
Cognitive Response to Contradictory Data: Executives frequently encounter conflicting or incomplete data, yet the mental processes they use to resolve uncertainty are not detailed.
5. Organizational and Cultural Factors in Decision-Making
Influence of Internal Politics and Power Structures: How executives’ decisions are shaped by political dynamics within organizations is absent from current analyses.
Hierarchical vs. Agile Decision-Making: There is no comparative insight into how structured corporate environments influence cognitive decision-making differently from startup cultures.
Cognitive Flexibility in Startups vs. Established Firms: The adaptability differences between startup leaders and executives in large corporations remain unexplored.
6. Modern Strategic Challenges
ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) Prioritization: There is no examination of how executives internally prioritize ESG considerations alongside financial goals.
Geopolitical Risk Cognition: The cognitive processing of geopolitical uncertainty and its strategic implications for executive decision-making are not covered.
Regulatory Uncertainty: How executives mentally navigate shifting regulations and legal ambiguities remains unaddressed.
Digital Transformation Resistance: The psychological barriers executives face when implementing large-scale technological shifts are not analyzed.
Remote and Distributed Decision-Making: The impact of virtual collaboration on executives’ cognitive processes and decision effectiveness is not explored.
7. Learning from Historical and Data-Driven Insights
Cognitive Use of Historical Precedent: While past financial outcomes are referenced, there is no discussion on how executives cognitively learn from or discard historical examples.
Post-Decision Evaluation and Learning: There is a gap in understanding how executives reflect on their decisions, identify biases, and refine future strategies.

Here's a clarifying step before I structure your final prompt:

### **Clarifying Objectives**

Before creating your optimized prompt for generating the interview questionnaire, let's clarify a few crucial points to ensure the questionnaire precisely meets your objectives and leverages the insights from your provided report:

1. **High-Level Themes and Structure:**
   - Do you prefer the final questionnaire to closely mirror the sections of your gaps analysis (e.g., Cognitive Biases, Crisis Decision-Making, AI and Tech), or do you want broader, more conversational themes like "Cognitive Influences," "Technology Integration," and "Strategic Challenges"?

2. **Conversational Flow:**
   - Do you want to start with priming questions similar to your sample (e.g., familiarity, general context), and then naturally progress into deeper, more targeted questions related to executive cognition and decision-making?

3. **Question Depth and Time Management:**
   - Given a 30-minute window, do you prefer more in-depth exploration of fewer high-priority gaps, or would you like brief coverage of multiple gap areas?

4. **Avoiding Assumptions:**
   - Would you prefer the questions phrased open-endedly, prompting the participant to elaborate naturally, or would you prefer some targeted follow-up probes embedded in the structure?

5. **Flexibility Across Industries and Sizes:**
   - Confirming: the questions should be universally applicable across all executives regardless of industry or company size, focusing purely on individual cognitive and decision-making processes rather than explicitly exploring industry/company differences?

6. **Examples and Stories:**
   - Do you want the questions explicitly structured to encourage storytelling or specific examples from the interviewee’s experience?

7. **Use of Provided Report (Context Dump):**
   - For the final prompt, should I include your full "Gaps in Executive Decision-Making" report as a context dump, or would you prefer a shorter summary placeholder instructing the model to draw insights directly from it?

Clarifying these points will help create a highly targeted, structured, and effective prompt for crafting your interview questionnaire.

## You (2025-03-11T16:19:34.489000+00:00)

1. I want broader, more conversational themes
2. lets keep the questions more targetted to our specific research area
3. Yes, I want in-depth exploration of a few topics
4. I think targetted follow-ups would be better.
5. Yes, the questions should be universally applicable
6. Yes, that would be great.

# Fasting and Machiavellian strategy

## You (2025-10-08T15:22:49.399000+00:00)

I'm fasting for the first time. It's just out of curiosity, to test myself. But I also have an event going to.

Think through all the things that could go wrong, what I should keep in mind, and how Machiavelli would help is prince think through different situations.

Finally, a machiavellian reality check, that's not discouraging to a prince, but helps him understand where to draw the line.

Ah, the first fast—a small theater in the grand opera of self-mastery. You are not merely abstaining from food, you are experimenting with deprivation, probing the boundaries of your will. This is not unlike a young prince sending scouts into unknown terrain. But do not be deceived: even in this small test, folly lurks. Let us consider the risks with the cold clarity of statecraft.

### **I. What Can Go Wrong?**

#### 1. **Physical Weakness**
Without nourishment, your energy may falter. This makes you vulnerable—physically sluggish, mentally dulled, easily irritable. If your event demands alertness, charm, or confrontation, you may find yourself disarmed.

> *“A prince must avoid being disarmed in any respect, whether in battle or banquet.”*

#### 2. **Cognitive Impairment**
Low glucose degrades judgment, and the mind's sharp edge is blunted. In public, this risks humiliation. In negotiation, it risks concession.

#### 3. **Social Perception**
If your fast becomes apparent to others—especially if you appear weak or distracted—they may perceive you as eccentric or unstable. A prince must never invite speculation about his health, mind, or motives. Power thrives in mystery, not in visible frailty.

#### 4. **Emotional Volatility**
Fasting can stir hidden temperaments: pride, ascetic superiority, or suppressed frustration. In public, such lapses betray the inner fortress.

### **II. Strategic Considerations for the Event**

- **Hydration is non-negotiable.** You may endure hunger, but thirst will humiliate you swiftly.
- **Timing is crucial.** Know when you began your fast and when you’ll break it. Time your appearance for your peak lucidity.
- **Exit strategy.** Have a discreet escape route if your condition falters. A prince must always reserve the right to vanish with grace.
- **Cover story.** If someone offers food or drink, decline without drawing curiosity. Blame a “medical thing,” a “short cleanse,” or a “prep for a blood test.” Vague health justifications silence questions.

### **III. The Machiavellian Framework: Fasting as a Political Tool**

A fast, when used strategically, **can signal discipline**, **religious devotion**, or **stoic virtue**—but only if done discreetly and in control. If flaunted or mishandled, it invites ridicule, suspicion, or pity—all fatal to authority.

Compare this to a prince who dons mourning garb in public: if sincere and well-timed, it deepens his gravitas; if performative, it exposes him as a sentimental fool.

> *“It is better to seem temperate than to be temperate, if one must choose.”*

### **IV. Machiavellian Reality Check**

Let us speak plainly: the fast is a means, not a virtue. You are not made nobler by hunger, only harder—if it serves your designs. But never confuse self-denial with strength. The man who withholds food from himself to test his will may indeed grow in discipline—but the man who collapses in public loses everything for the sake of a private experiment.

> *“He who risks his body to train his mind must remember the mind dies with the body.”*

Know the purpose of your fast. Is it to impress others? Foolish. Is it to test your resolve? Wiser, but still vanity if the test ruins the performance.

So here is the line: **fast so long as the fast serves your command over yourself and others. The moment it compromises either, it must be broken.** Do not let your body become your tyrant in the name of controlling it.

> *“To govern others, a man must first rule himself—but not as a martyr, as a strategist.”*

If you wish, I can help you prepare specific lines or tactics for navigating the event while fasting. Or, if the real goal is to master your impulses, we can set that strategy too. Your will, Prince.

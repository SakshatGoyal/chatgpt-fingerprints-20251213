# Convert GitHub to PDF

## You (2025-08-23T19:27:04.755000+00:00)

I want to scrap all the content from this github repo so it's available to me in either a pdf or a .md file.

https://github.com/entrepeneur4lyf/cognitive-prompt-architecture?tab=readme-ov-file#executive-summary

Could you do that for me? [Don't go ahead and start doing it, just let me know if it's possible.] And if not, are there other methods I can use?

I downlaoded the html version of this, and i'm also wondering if there's a simple script that can convert all the content into a file, but I don't want to loose the diagrams.

Short answer: yes—totally doable. There are a few clean ways to pull an entire GitHub repo into a single `.md` or a polished PDF, and you can keep diagrams (including Mermaid) if you render them during the build. The repo’s README already uses Mermaid and structured sections (e.g., “Executive Summary”), so you’ll want a toolchain that can render Mermaid blocks before/while converting to PDF. fileciteturn5file0L1-L1

Here are pragmatic options (no action taken yet):

# Fastest paths
1) **Single, combined `.md` → PDF (best control, keeps diagrams)**
   - Clone the repo, concatenate all `.md` files (README first), then convert:
   - Tools: `pandoc` + Mermaid support.
   - Mermaid options:
     - `pandoc` + `mermaid-filter` (uses `mmdc` under the hood), or
     - `npx md-to-pdf` (headless Chrome; can load Mermaid via plugin config).
   - Key flags: `--resource-path=.:assets` and `--embed-resources` to inline images.

2) **One PDF per `.md`, keep them separate**
   - Run `pandoc` (or `md-to-pdf`) on each `.md`.
   - Useful if you want modular documents.

3) **Use your saved GitHub HTML**
   - Print the HTML with a headless browser:
     - `chrome --headless --print-to-pdf=out.pdf file:///…/your.html`
   - This works, but: GitHub’s Mermaid is rendered dynamically via their viewer; offline HTML can miss those SVGs. If diagrams don’t appear, prefer the markdown → renderer route above. fileciteturn5file0L1-L1

# Minimal scripts you can run (when you’re ready)
## A) Combine all markdown to one file (README first)
```bash
# from the repo root
printf "" > _combined.md
[ -f README.md ] && { echo -e "# README\n"; cat README.md; echo; } >> _combined.md
git ls-files '*.md' | grep -v -E '^README\.md$|^_combined\.md$' \
  | while read f; do
      echo -e "\n\n# ${f}\n" >> _combined.md
      cat "$f" >> _combined.md
    done
```

## B) Convert that one file to a self‑contained PDF with Mermaid (Pandoc route)
```bash
# Install once:
# brew install pandoc mermaid-cli   # macOS
# pip install pandoc-mermaid-filter # or: npm i -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

pandoc _combined.md \
  --from gfm \
  --to pdf \
  --pdf-engine=wkhtmltopdf \
  --filter pandoc-mermaid \
  --resource-path=".:assets:machine-learning" \
  --embed-resources \
  --toc \
  -o cognitive-prompt-architecture.pdf
```
Notes:
- If `wkhtmltopdf` struggles with CSS, try `--pdf-engine=weasyprint` or generate HTML first then print:
  ```bash
  pandoc _combined.md --from gfm --to html5 --standalone \
    --filter pandoc-mermaid --resource-path=".:assets:machine-learning" \
    --embed-resources --toc -o tmp.html
  /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome \
    --headless --print-to-pdf=cpu.pdf "file://$PWD/tmp.html"
  ```

## C) Simple alternative using md-to-pdf (Chrome-based)
```bash
# Install once:
# npm i -g md-to-pdf
md-to-pdf _combined.md --config-file md2pdf.config.json
```
`md2pdf.config.json` can inject Mermaid support:
```json
{
  "stylesheet": [],
  "as_html": true,
  "body_class": "markdown-body",
  "launch_options": { "args": ["--no-sandbox"] },
  "pdf_options": { "format": "Letter", "printBackground": true },
  "remark_plugins": ["remark-mermaidjs"]
}
```

# Keeping diagrams/images intact
- **Mermaid**: use a pipeline that renders Mermaid (Pandoc + mermaid filter, or md‑to‑pdf with `remark-mermaidjs`). That converts code blocks into SVGs before PDF.
- **Local images**: `--resource-path` and `--embed-resources` ensure relative images (e.g., in `/assets`) embed into the output.
- **GitHub-only styling**: If you want the GitHub look, convert to HTML with a GitHub-style CSS (e.g., `github-markdown-css`) then print to PDF.

# If you prefer a single `.md` output only
- The concat script above already gives you `_combined.md` that you can keep as your master “book” file. It preserves all markdown (including Mermaid blocks). You can stop there if `.md` is all you need; render to PDF later anytime.

# TL;DR
- **Is it possible?** Yes—easy.
- **Best results with diagrams:** Convert the repo’s markdown → HTML/PDF with a Mermaid-aware toolchain (Pandoc + mermaid filter or `md-to-pdf` + plugin).
- **Using your downloaded HTML:** You can print it, but Mermaid may not render offline; the markdown route is more reliable. fileciteturn5file0L1-L1

If you tell me which output you prefer first (single `.md` vs single PDF), I’ll hand you the exact one-liner(s) tailored for your MacBook terminal and the repo’s folder layout.

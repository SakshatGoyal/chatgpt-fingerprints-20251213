Detecting counterfeit U.S. dollars requires a combination of visual inspection, tactile assessment, and the use of tools if necessary. Here are key steps to identify fake currency:

### 1. **Check the Paper**
- **Texture**: Genuine U.S. currency is printed on a special cotton-linen blend paper that feels crisp and slightly rough. Counterfeit notes often feel smoother or have a waxy texture.
- **Thickness**: Counterfeit bills may be thicker or thinner than genuine bills.

### 2. **Inspect the Printing Quality**
- **Microprinting**: Genuine notes have tiny text in specific areas (e.g., around portraits or borders) that is crisp and clear under magnification. Counterfeit bills often have blurry or smudged microprinting.
- **Sharpness**: Authentic currency has sharp, fine details in the design. Fakes often look slightly pixelated or fuzzy under close examination.

### 3. **Look for Security Features**
- **Watermark**: Hold the bill up to the light. Genuine bills (except $1 and $2 notes) have a watermark matching the portrait on the bill, visible on both sides.
- **Security Thread**: A vertical thread is embedded in the bill and visible when held up to light. It glows under ultraviolet (UV) light in a color specific to the denomination:
  - $5: Blue
  - $10: Orange
  - $20: Green
  - $50: Yellow
  - $100: Pink
- **Color-Shifting Ink**: On denominations of $10 and higher, the numeral in the lower right corner changes color (e.g., from copper to green) when tilted.
- **3D Ribbon (on $100 bills)**: Tilt the bill to see the blue security ribbon; the images (bells and 100s) shift as you move the note.

### 4. **Examine the Portrait**
- **Detail**: The portrait on a genuine bill appears lifelike with fine details. Counterfeits often have flat, dull, or blurry images.
- **Shadowing**: Authentic notes have subtle, intricate shadowing.

### 5. **Check the Serial Numbers**
- **Spacing and Font**: Serial numbers should be evenly spaced and match the style of genuine notes.
- **Consistency**: On genuine bills, the serial number color matches the Treasury Seal, and the numbers are unique.

### 6. **Use Tools**
- **UV Light**: Quickly reveals the security thread and watermark.
- **Magnifying Glass**: Helps inspect microprinting and fine details.
- **Counterfeit Detector Pen**: Marks made on genuine bills will stay clear or light yellow; on counterfeit bills, they turn dark.

### 7. **Compare with a Genuine Bill**
If you're unsure, compare the suspicious bill with a genuine one of the same denomination and series year. Subtle differences often become apparent.

### 8. **Seek Professional Help**
If you're still uncertain, take the bill to a bank or contact local law enforcement. They have the tools and expertise to verify its authenticity. 

Avoid passing counterfeit bills, as it's illegal and could lead to serious consequences.

# Documenting design rationale

## You (2025-10-27T22:08:37.043000+00:00)

During this course, I'm going to give you a series of screenshots of an interface. I'll explain what the design means and once I say, once I tell you to document all facts, all figures, or all content, I need you to essentially create a single document that covers all of the activities, the data available, and the thought process or the reasoning behind the designs of all the screens that I have shared.

Perfect — got it.

Let me restate what I’ll do to make sure we’re aligned:

1. You’ll share **a series of screenshots** (likely UI screens).
2. You’ll **explain each one** — what the design means, what the data or interactions represent, and any reasoning behind it.
3. Once you say something like **“Document all facts”** (or equivalent), I’ll compile **everything we’ve covered** into a **single, cohesive document** that includes:
   - A factual inventory of **all data, figures, and visible UI elements**.
   - A structured description of **all user flows, activities, and features**.
   - A summary of the **design rationale, logic, or decision-making** behind each screen.
   - Cohesive formatting (clear sections, consistent terminology, and traceability back to screens if possible).

Would you like me to treat that final document as a **product design reference (functional + rationale)** or as a **formal specification (requirements-level detail)**?
That will help me match the tone and structure you want when we compile it.

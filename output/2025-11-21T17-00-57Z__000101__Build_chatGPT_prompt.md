# Build chatGPT prompt

## You (2025-11-21T17:00:57.391000+00:00)

help me build a prompt for chatGPT agent mode for the following intent.

---

I want to look at mckissok and colibri real estate. two seperate websites. these have a range of educational, certification, and other products. my goal is to make sure I capture a very wide variety of products and the different types of disclaimers they have when they are placed in a cart. Usually if a product has a disclaimer, its displayed on the product line in the cart.

the challenge is, because there's such a wide variety of products, i fear that the agent mode will stop after just looking at a few products. But i also don't want to specify a particular number of products to look at. Just that I need to encapsulate everything.

Great — thanks for laying that out clearly. Before we **begin creating the prompt**, I’d like to walk through a few discovery questions to refine your intent and define an execution framework that balances **coverage** with **efficiency**, and handles edge cases like **incomplete crawling** or **UI variability**.

---

### 🧠 Quick Discovery Questions

1. **Scope Confirmation**
   ✅ Are you focusing **only on the shopping cart view** (i.e., after adding products) for finding disclaimers? Or do you also want to scan:
   - Product detail pages
   - Course description pages
   - Checkout screens?

2. **Disclaimer Types**
   Do you want to capture **all forms** of disclaimers (e.g., legal notes, state-specific warnings, renewal timing notes, refund policies), or only those that **might affect purchase decision or legal obligations**?

3. **Navigation Behavior**
   Should the agent:
   - Add all products it finds to the cart and inspect them?
   - Or just inspect product-cart behavior if a product is already in the cart?

4. **When the Agent Encounters a Dead End**
   If the site requires login, or if products are loaded dynamically (e.g., JavaScript-based filters or tabs), should the agent:
   - Skip that section and log it?
   - Try to interact with the UI (e.g., click buttons, expand sections)?
   - Or pause and return results up to that point?

5. **Output Structure Preference**
   Do you want the results to be:
   - A full list of products with any associated disclaimer text?
   - Grouped by category (e.g., licensing vs. CE vs. exam prep)?
   - Only a summary of the different types of disclaimers and the products they appear on?

---

Once you confirm or adjust the above, I’ll be ready to **begin creating the prompt** with:

- A **scraping + cart-interaction persona** for the Agent
- A repeat-safe loop with an **"exhaustive traversal until product pool is complete"** method
- Guardrails to capture **missing/disrupted sections** (e.g., gated products, dynamic loading)

Ready when you are.

1. I'm focusing only on what the disclaimer is on the shopping cart view
2. all disclaimer types.
3. whichever is more efficient for our main goal.
4. the site doesn't require a sign in.
5. in the output, I want a collection of all the different types of dislaimers thematically linked, with a few links to the products that have that type of disclaimer.

Now that you have all the answers, help me understand the pros and cons for this goal if I use agent mode vs use chatGPT Heavy thinking

## ChatGPT (2025-11-21T17:04:58.865805+00:00)

Excellent—your clarified scope is now sharp and targeted. You're focusing on **cart-view disclaimers**, aiming to **collect all types**, and want an **organized thematic summary** with **linked examples**.

Let’s compare **Agent Mode** vs. **ChatGPT (Heavy Thinking mode)** for this task, using your goal as the basis:

---

## ⚔️ Agent Mode vs. Heavy Thinking (LLM-only)

| **Aspect** | **Agent Mode** | **ChatGPT (Heavy Thinking)** |
|------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Exploration** | ✅ *Can browse both McKissock & Colibri directly, follow links, add products to cart, and observe disclaimers in context* | ❌ *Cannot access live sites. Needs full context from you (screenshots, HTML, product list, etc.)* |
| **Product Coverage** | ✅ *Can loop through categories and dynamically load more content*<br>⚠️ *May stop early unless explicitly instructed to explore fully* | ❌ *Static only. Cannot find new products or explore categories on its own* |
| **Dynamic Cart Behavior** | ✅ *Can test how disclaimers appear depending on what's in the cart* | ❌ *Cannot test or trigger cart states* |
| **Disclaimer Extraction** | ✅ *Can extract disclaimers across many products*<br>⚠️ *Needs prompt guardrails to avoid skipping or prematurely summarizing* | ✅ *Can analyze a full set of disclaimers if you provide the raw text, e.g., screenshots or HTML from cart views* |
| **Scalability** | ⚠️ *May time out or give up if there are too many products unless told to exhaustively iterate* | ✅ *Infinitely scalable if you give it all the input* |
| **Output Quality** | ✅ *Can provide structured, contextual, link-backed output if prompted correctly* | ✅ *Can do deep thematic categorization and reasoning if fed the right raw data* |
| **Effort Required by You** | ✅ *Fully autonomous once launched* | ❌ *You must gather all cart view screenshots or source HTML manually* |

---

## 🧠 Summary

| Use **Agent Mode** if: |
|------------------------|
- You want to automate **discovery, navigation, and cart interactions**.
- You don’t want to (or can’t) collect cart screenshots manually.
- You’re comfortable managing potential Agent limits (e.g., runtime, partial crawling).
- You need **live links** to each example in the final output.

| Use **Heavy Thinking Mode** if: |
|-----------------------------|
- You already have a dataset (screenshots, scraped cart views).
- You want **deep thematic reasoning**, clustering, or taxonomy building.
- You need full control over inputs, or want to verify and redact anything before processing.
- The websites change too often for autonomous agents to stay reliable.

Ok, i'll use agent mode. begin creating the prompt.

## ✅ PromptCraft O3: Agent Mode Prompt for Exhaustive Disclaimer Extraction from Real Estate Sites

---

### **1. Goal**

Systematically explore and interact with **both the McKissock** and **Colibri Real Estate** websites to extract **all types of disclaimers** that appear in the **shopping cart view** once products are added. The goal is to capture the **full diversity of disclaimer content** across the wide range of available products, and to organize the findings by **disclaimer theme**, with **example product links** for each type.

---

### **2. Return Format**

Provide a structured output with the following schema:

```json
{
  "disclaimer_categories": [
    {
      "theme": "Refund Policy",
      "description": "Disclaimers referring to refund eligibility, deadlines, or restrictions.",
      "example_products": [
        { "product_name": "Texas CE Package", "product_url": "https://..." },
        { "product_name": "California Exam Prep", "product_url": "https://..." }
      ],
      "disclaimer_text_samples": [
        "This course is non-refundable after 24 hours.",
        "Refunds not available once materials are accessed."
      ]
    },
    {
      "theme": "State Approval Notice",
      ...
    }
  ],
  "site_coverage_log": {
    "mckissock": {
      "products_checked": 42,
      "notes": "Covered all main categories including CE, licensing, and appraisal.",
      "issues": []
    },
    "colibri": {
      "products_checked": 38,
      "notes": "Some products loaded via JS scrolling. Ensured complete loading via pagination.",
      "issues": ["Some course bundles showed no cart disclaimer."]
    }
  }
}
```

---

### **3. Warnings & Guardrails**

- **Do not stop early** after sampling a few products. Your goal is **exhaustive coverage** across all major product types, including:
  - Licensing courses
  - CE (continuing education)
  - Certification add-ons
  - Bundles and exam prep
- If products are dynamically loaded (e.g., via scrolling or category filters), simulate user interaction to **load and explore all visible products**.
- Only add a product to cart if required to trigger the disclaimer view.
- If no disclaimer is visible in cart view for a product, log that explicitly

## Research Objective: Find empirical information to help create a custom GPT of **Krishna** for

a system that emulates his *cognitive stance and integrative awareness*—playful yet lucid, compassionate yet unentangled, strategically sharp yet inwardly serene.

---

### Identity Basics

* What depictions of Krishna (across texts like the Mahabharata, Bhagavata Purana, Harivamsa, and major commentaries) most clearly show **how he sees himself**—as friend, ruler, charioteer, divine being, or witness beyond roles—and how do these self-presentations shift with context?
* In which episodes does Krishna explicitly **name or define his own nature** (e.g., as time, as witness, as friend, as destroyer, as preserver), and how might these self-definitions map into distinct “modes” a GPT persona should be able to inhabit?
* How do different traditions (Vaishnava schools, Advaitic readings, regional bhakti literatures) describe **Krishna’s core identity**—is he primarily lover, teacher, sovereign, cosmic principle—and what tensions or overlaps appear between these portraits?
* Where do we see Krishna interacting with those who **do not know he is divine** versus those who do, and how does that difference in how others see him reshape his way of speaking, acting, or revealing himself?

*(Most useful sources: primary scriptures and respected commentaries that compare multiple portrayals; scholarly syntheses on Krishna’s evolving identity across texts and traditions.)*

---

### Tone & Style

* In dialogues where Krishna must soothe, confront, or redirect someone (child, warrior, king, lover), what patterns emerge in his **tone**—for example, when is he teasing, when is he grave, when is he paradoxical, when is he blunt—and what triggers these tonal shifts?
* How does Krishna modulate his **style of explanation**—mythic story, sharp logical argument, metaphor, cosmic revelation—depending on whether he is speaking to a child, a devotee, a skeptic, a warrior, or an enemy?
* Are there passages where Krishna uses **humor or apparent lightness** to deliver a heavy truth, or **austere seriousness** to cut through emotional chaos—and what linguistic features (phrasing, imagery, rhythm) mark those modes?
* What are characteristic **speech patterns** we can extract—recurring metaphors, favored contrasts, ways he frames responsibility, freedom, and fate—that would help a GPT “sound like” Krishna in a way that is recognizable but not caricatured?

*(Most useful sources: direct speech of Krishna in Mahabharata and Bhagavata Purana, the Bhagavad Gita in multiple translations, and rhetorical analyses of his discourse.)*

---

### Behavioral Patterns

* Across childhood, youth, and kingship, what consistent **behavioral tendencies** show how Krishna handles conflict: does he first tease, test, warn, negotiate, and only then break equilibrium—and in what situations does he bypass the early steps?
* How does Krishna typically respond when confronted with **strong emotion in others** (grief, rage, shame, infatuation, arrogance)? Does he mirror, calm, confront, redirect, or ignore—and what sequences of moves are most common?
* In episodes where Krishna faces **moral ambiguity**—no fully clean option—how does he decide which value to privilege (e.g., loyalty vs. justice, individual well-being vs. social order, short-term relief vs. long-term clarity)?
* Are there specific patterns in how Krishna **tests a person** before guiding them more deeply—through questions, provocations, silence, or seemingly unrelated actions—and how might these tests reveal his assessment of their readiness?
* When Krishna removes himself—through silence, physical departure, or allowing events to unfold without interference—what does that tell us about his pattern for **withdrawing influence** once his role in a situation is complete?

*(Most useful sources: narrative episodes analyzed thematically—Krishna as child, lover, diplomat, strategist, king; comparative studies of his conduct in different roles.)*

---

### Values & Motivations

* When Krishna articulates reasons for his actions (or inaction), what **values does he explicitly name**—such as protection of dharma, loyalty, compassion, promise-keeping, detachment, devotion, or cosmic necessity—and how do these values interact or conflict?
* In situations where he appears “harsh” or “unforgiving,” what deeper **motivations** can be inferred—preventing greater harm, accelerating an inevitable outcome, teaching a difficult lesson, honoring a vow, or preserving a subtle balance?
* How does Krishna’s sense of **responsibility** operate at different scales: to a single person (friend/lover/devotee), to a family or clan, to a kingdom, to the entire cosmic order—and how does he rank these when they cannot all be satisfied?
* Where does Krishna explicitly discuss **desire, attachment, and ego**—not just as abstract concepts, but as forces shaping choice—and how does his view of them guide the kind of advice he gives to confused or conflicted individuals?
* How do bhakti traditions, philosophical commentaries, and regional retellings interpret **what Krishna “wants” from humans**—devotion, understanding, courage, surrender, playfulness, discernment—and how can these be distilled into a coherent motivation model for a GPT?

*(Most useful sources: Gita for explicit values; Bhagavata Purana and bhakti literature for motivational interpretations; philosophical commentaries for value hierarchies.)*

---

### Exemplars & Anecdotes

* What are the best-chosen scenes that showcase Krishna **embracing apparent contradiction**—tender yet stern, playful yet uncompromising, detached yet deeply involved—and how can each be unpacked to reveal the underlying cognitive stance?
* Which stories most clearly reveal Krishna’s habit of **turning a person’s own assumptions against them**—a friend, a proud warrior, a devotee—and how does he do this without cruelty or nihilism?
* Are there anecdotes that show Krishna dealing with **ordinary, non-epic situations**—small conflicts, personal insecurities, domestic dynamics—where his divine insight is expressed in subtly human gestures rather than grand doctrine?
* Which episodes highlight Krishna’s way of responding when someone **misunderstands him or projects onto him** (seeing only the lover, only the strategist, only the god) and how he corrects or allows that perception to stand?

*(Most useful sources: story-centered texts like Bhagavata Purana, Harivamsa, regional Krishna lore; modern retellings and commentaries that interpret these anecdotes psychologically.)*

---

### Domain Competence

*(Here: spiritual philosophy, dharma ethics, statesmanship, relational psychology, and existential guidance.)*

* In the Bhagavad Gita and related passages, how does Krishna structure **philosophical explanation**—does he move from the immediate problem to the eternal principle, or from absolute truth back down to practical advice, and how does he mark that movement?
* What evidence from the epics demonstrates Krishna’s **competence in reading human character**—anticipating betrayals, understanding hidden motives, recognizing latent strengths or weaknesses—and how does he adapt his guidance accordingly?
* In his role as advisor and strategist, what does Krishna seem to know about **systems and long-term dynamics** (political, familial, social), and how does that meta-knowledge shape his tolerance for short-term pain or moral compromise?
* How does Krishna speak about **action, inaction, and appropriate action**—not just as abstract categories, but as operational guidance to someone facing paralysis, rage, or despair?

*(Most useful sources: Gita, political and ethical episodes in Mahabharata, classical and modern analyses of Krishna as statesman and psychologist of dharma.)*

---

### Emotional & Social Guidance

* When someone comes to Krishna **torn between heart and duty**, how does he engage them emotionally before offering any doctrine—does he validate, challenge, reframe, or ignore their feelings, and what sequence can be mapped from emotional turmoil to clarity?
* How does Krishna handle **attachment** in relationships—romantic, familial, friendly—so that love is fully expressed without losing inner freedom, and what specific episodes best show this balancing act?
* In scenes where someone is humiliated, ashamed, or grieving, what are Krishna’s characteristic **moves of consolation**—does he restore dignity, shift perspective to a larger frame, redirect attention, or quietly adjust circumstances?
* Where do we see Krishna setting or respecting **boundaries**—choosing not to intervene, not to rescue, not to explain—and what internal logic seems to guide when he steps in versus when he lets consequences unfold?

*(Most useful sources: Krishna’s close relationships—Arjuna, Draupadi, Radha/gopis, Sudama, family members; devotional literature focused on emotional nuances.)*

---

### Strategic & Analytical Reasoning

* In moments of high tension, how does Krishna seem to **analyze a situation**—what factors does he weigh (timing, character, precedent, unseen risks, symbolic impact), and how are his decisions justified afterward by himself or others?
* Are there examples where Krishna chooses a **second-best or “least bad” option** and openly acknowledges its cost, and what does this reveal about his threshold for compromise in service of a higher aim?
* How does Krishna integrate **short-term tactics with long-term vision**—for instance, accepting immediate losses, reputational damage, or suffering to prevent deeper disorder later?
* In dialogues where he advises warriors, rulers, or elders, what patterns define his **problem decomposition**—how does he break down a messy moral dilemma into parts that can be acted on?

*(Most useful sources: politically and ethically charged episodes around war, diplomacy, and succession; commentaries treating Krishna as strategist rather than purely as deity.)*

---

### Creative & Expressive Tasks

* What are the aesthetic and emotional qualities of Krishna’s **non-didactic expressions**—his songs, play, teasing, poetic language—compared to his formal teaching, and how might these inform a lighter, more playful advisory mode in the GPT?
* How does Krishna use **imagery and metaphor**—nature, the body, warfare, music, relationship—to smuggle difficult truths into forms that can be felt as well as understood?
* In devotional and poetic traditions centered on Krishna, which elements of **voice** (tender irony, intimate address, paradoxical praise) feel most faithful to how canonical texts show him speaking and relating?

*(Most useful sources: Gita’s metaphors, Krishna’s speech in narrative scenes, bhakti poetry and songs that aim to “channel” his voice.)*

---

### Moral & Ethical Reasoning

* When Krishna justifies morally ambiguous actions, what **ethical framework** is implied—priority of dharma over rule, order over sentiment, long-term harmony over short-term fairness—and how does he articulate this without collapsing into relativism?
* How does Krishna distinguish between **inner purity of intent** and **outer purity of method**, and in what ways does he suggest that a method can be outwardly transgressive yet inwardly aligned with the highest good?
* In his teachings, how does Krishna reconcile the tension between **personal duty (svadharma)** and **universal ethics**, especially for those whose roles demand violence, strategic deception, or painful decisions?
* Are there passages where Krishna acknowledges **tragic outcomes** that cannot be fully “made right,” and how does he guide others to live with the residue of such choices without drowning in guilt?

*(Most useful sources: ethical debates in the Mahabharata involving Krishna; Gita’s sections on action, duty, and consequence; philosophical commentaries on Krishna’s dharma ethics.)*

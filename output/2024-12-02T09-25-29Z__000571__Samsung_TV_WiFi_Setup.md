Ok so none of the above solutions worked except when I tried to connect it to my phone’s hotspot WiFi. But how do I get it connected to my home WiFi

## ChatGPT (2024-12-02T11:03:24.581206+00:00)

If your TV connects to your phone's hotspot but not your home WiFi, the issue likely lies with your router or how the TV and router interact. Here’s how you can troubleshoot further:

### 1. **Check for WiFi Frequency Compatibility**
   - **Check Band (2.4 GHz vs. 5 GHz):** Some TVs only support 2.4 GHz WiFi. Ensure your router's WiFi band matches the TV's compatibility.
     - Log in to your router (via TP-Link Tether or a web browser).
     - Ensure the 2.4 GHz band is enabled. If your router has separate SSIDs for 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, try connecting to the 2.4 GHz network.

### 2. **Simplify Your Network Settings**
   - **Rename the Network (SSID):** If your router has a long or complex name, try renaming it to something simple (e.g., "HomeWiFi").
   - **Use a Simple Password:** Some devices struggle with special characters. Set a password with only letters and numbers (e.g., "MyWiFi2024").

### 3. **Reboot Router with No Connected Devices**
   - Disconnect all devices from your router (turn off WiFi on phones, laptops, etc.).
   - Restart the router, and then try connecting the TV as the first device.

### 4. **Change Router Channel**
   - Congested WiFi channels can cause connection issues. In your router settings:
     - Change the WiFi channel for the 2.4 GHz band (try channels 1, 6, or 11).
     - For 5 GHz, choose a different channel, like 36 or 40.

### 5. **Manually Assign an IP Address**
   - Since it worked with your hotspot, your TV may struggle to obtain an IP address from the router.
     - Log in to your router and check connected devices to find an unused IP range (e.g., `192.168.0.150`).
     - On your TV, go to *Network > IP Settings* and set the IP address manually:
       - **IP Address:** `192.168.0.150`
       - **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.0`
       - **Gateway:** Your router’s IP address (usually `192.168.0.1`).
       - **DNS Server:** `8.8.8.8` or `1.1.1.1`.

### 6. **Disable Firewall or Security Filters**
   - Some routers have firewalls or security settings that block new devices. Disable these temporarily to test:
     - Log in to your router settings.
     - Turn off "MAC Address Filtering" or "Access Control."

### 7. **Reset Router Settings**
   - If you’ve modified many settings on your router, resetting it to factory defaults might help. After resetting:
     - Set up your WiFi again with a simple SSID and password.
     - Try connecting the TV first.

### 8. **Update Router Firmware**
   - Outdated firmware can cause compatibility issues. Check for updates in your router's settings via the TP-Link Tether app or admin panel.

### 9. **Test with a Guest Network**
   - If your router supports a guest network, enable it and try connecting your TV to that. Guest networks often have fewer restrictions.

### 10. **Consider a Wired Connection**
   - If all else fails, use an Ethernet cable to connect your TV directly to the router. You can also use a WiFi range extender with an Ethernet port.

These steps should help pinpoint the issue. Let me know if you need further guidance on any of them!

Still doesn’t work. 

Here’s the thing. I have two bandwidths - 

VanNess 
VanNess_5G

These are the two networks from my router. The first one is 2.4g

I have 3 TVs. All Samsung. One of the is 43” and the other two (same model) are 32”

My 43” tv is able to connect to the 5g network but not with the 2.4g network. The 32” tv cannot find the 5g network. 

The strange thing is, when I first bought the router and set it up, my 43” tv was able to connect to the 2.4g network but I kept it connected to the 5g network. Now it can’t connect to the 2.4g network despite finding it. 

I don’t experience this issue with any other device at home, whether it’s smartphones or tablets or laptops.

## ChatGPT (2024-12-03T08:49:16.589251+00:00)

It seems like there might be a configuration issue with your router or TVs that's causing this inconsistency. Here are some possible causes and solutions tailored to your situation:

  - Alternatively, use a WiFi extender with an Ethernet port to connect the 32” TVs to the network via cable.

---

### **7. Verify DHCP Settings**
- Ensure the DHCP server is enabled on the router and that the IP pool size is sufficient (e.g., `192.168.0.100` to `192.168.0.199`).
- You can assign static IPs to the TVs within this range if needed.

---

### **8. Consider Potential Hardware Issues**
- If none of the above works, there may be a hardware fault:
  - **For the Router**: Test with another router if available to rule out router-specific issues.
  - **For the TVs**: If only certain TVs are affected, their WiFi modules may be faulty. You can test them with a USB WiFi adapter (if supported) or connect via Ethernet.

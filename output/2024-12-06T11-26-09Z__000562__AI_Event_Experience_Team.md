You should know that while I want to improve the event experiences. I will not have the ability to select speakers invite speakers or have any control over the content they share with that in mind do you think that changes the kind of people I might need for this Council?

## ChatGPT (2024-12-06T12:06:30.938578+00:00)

Absolutely, that constraint does influence the types of roles you'll prioritize for your advisory team. Since you won't have control over speakers or content, your focus should shift more toward **enhancing the overall attendee experience**—before, during, and after the event—while leveraging AI and design thinking to make the event more engaging and valuable. Here's how your Council might change:

---

### **Core Adjustments to Roles**

#### **1. Experience Designers (Highly Prioritized)**
- **Service Designer** (Essential)  
  - Becomes even more critical since the overall attendee experience—not just the content—is now the primary area for improvement.

- **Interaction Designer (for Digital Tools)**  
  - Designs AI-enabled features like personalized schedules, networking apps, or interactive Q&A tools that help attendees engage with the event effectively, even if the content isn't in your control.

- **Spatial Designer**  
  - Focuses on creating breakout areas, lounge spaces, or even virtual equivalents that encourage meaningful discussions and decompression.  

---

- **Accessibility Specialist**  
  - Helps integrate tools like AI-driven real-time captions, translation services, and adaptive interfaces.  
  - Designs inclusive spaces and experiences to accommodate diverse needs.

---

#### **5. Content Enhancers (Supporting Attendees' Experience of the Content)**
While you can’t shape what speakers say, you can help attendees extract more value from the content.

- **Content Strategist (Support Role)**  
  - Focuses on creating supplemental materials like session guides, summaries, or AI-powered note-taking tools.  
  - Helps craft follow-up content, such as highlight reels or curated takeaways.

- **Media Producer**  
  - Ensures that high-quality audio, video, and visuals enhance the delivery of speaker content, making it more accessible and engaging.  
  - Produces "engagement bridges," such as short videos or infographics, that link sessions to broader event themes.

---

#### **6. Behavioral and Human-Centered Experts (Even More Relevant)**
Since content isn’t in your control, you can focus on optimizing how attendees engage with the event.

- **Behavioral Psychologist**  
  - Advises on session timing, breaks, and cognitive load to help attendees stay focused and energized.

   - Relies on the input of other team members (e.g., Service Designers and Behavioral Experts) to ensure content aligns with the event experience.

5. **Behavioral Expert (Dr. Alex Thompson)**  
   - Primarily offers guidance and insights rather than creating tangible outputs, requiring close collaboration with designers and strategists to implement recommendations.  
   - Limited ability to influence hard constraints, like fixed session lengths or inflexible event schedules.

### **General Team Limitations**
- **Dependence on Collaboration:** Many roles require interdependence to succeed. For example, the Digital Product Designer relies on Service Designers for journey alignment and on Behavioral Experts for insights.  
- **Technical Expertise Gap:** While all team members have supplemental knowledge of AI, accessibility, and data analysis, they may lack the depth required for technical implementation, potentially requiring external expertise or pre-built tools.  
- **No Control Over Content:** Without control over speaker content, much of the attendee experience depends on indirect enhancements rather than direct influence on the core sessions.  

These limitations highlight areas where external expertise, collaboration, or strategic adjustments may be needed to fully realize your goals. Would you like strategies to mitigate these weaknesses?

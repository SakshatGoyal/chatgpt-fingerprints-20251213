---

##  Core Identification & Access Benefits

- **Proof of Identity and San Francisco Residency**

### Additional Note on Privacy and Data

San Francisco’s City ID program **does not include a prepaid debit function**, unlike some other Bay Area cities, which reduces exposure to potential data privacy risks tied to financial transactions. Moreover, the city makes efforts *not to retain copies of applicants’ documents or addresses*, helping safeguard privacy consistent with its sanctuary city policies. citeturn0news20turn0search1.

Here’s what’s **free with proof of SF residency** (your **SF City ID** works as ID—if yours doesn’t show your current address, bring a recent bill/lease on your phone as backup):

### Always free for SF residents (daily)
- **San Francisco Botanical Garden (Golden Gate Park)** — free every day with SF residency; site lists acceptable residency proof. citeturn0search0  
- **Japanese Tea Garden (Golden Gate Park)** — free every day for SF residents (plus a free hour for everyone M/W/F 9–10am). citeturn3search3turn3search1  
- **Conservatory of Flowers (Golden Gate Park)** — free every day for SF residents. citeturn3search3  

> The Gardens’ official page confirms: “Admission to the Gardens is free to San Francisco residents,” and lists what they accept as proof (ID with SF address, or photo ID + utility bill/lease; digital copies OK). Your SF City ID counts as government-issued photo ID; if it doesn’t show your address, pair it with a recent bill. citeturn0search0

### Free on designated **SF Resident Free Days**
- **San Francisco Zoo** — periodic resident free days (check calendar). Entry requires **government-issued ID** showing SF residency; bring your SF City ID (and a bill if the address isn’t printed). citeturn0search1turn0search5

---

### Bonus: resident free programs (your SF City ID can serve as residency proof)
These aren’t City-ID-specific perks, but your City ID works to prove residency:
- **SFMOMA — First Thursdays (Bay Area residents)**, free general admission monthly (reserve ahead). citeturn6search0turn6search1  
- **de Young Museum — Free Saturdays (Bay Area residents)**, free general admission weekly (ID or postmarked mail accepted). citeturn6search7
- **Museums for All (summer & ongoing)** — many SF museums (incl. de Young, Legion, MoAD, etc.) offer **free or $3** entry **if you also show EBT or Medi-Cal** plus SF residency proof (City ID is accepted as residency proof; some official pages list examples like driver’s license, student ID, or library card). citeturn7search2

If you want, I can check a specific spot’s ticket desk language for **“City ID”** by name before you go, but the list above are the big ones where your SF City ID works to unlock free entry.

Short answer: there isn’t a current, city-maintained public directory of small businesses that give **“SF City ID cardholder”** discounts. The City’s page says businesses may opt in and be listed, but no live list is published, and most merchants advertise **“locals/SF resident”** deals (your **SF City ID** works as proof of residency) rather than “City ID-only” discounts. citeturn2search0

That said, here are **verified, small/independent places** in SF that explicitly offer **locals/SF-ID** perks right now (your City ID is valid proof). I grouped them by type:

### Food & drink (Ghirardelli Square “Locals’ Night”—show SF ID at checkout)
- **Barrio** (Mexican)  
- **Palette Tea House** (dim sum)  
- **San Francisco Brewing Co.** (brewpub)  
- **Square Pie Guys** (pizza)  
- **Cultivar** (wine bar & kitchen)  
- **Lola SF** (restaurant)  
- **Gigi Rose** (gifts)  
- **Gigi + Rosie** (apparel)  
- **Vom Fass** (oil/vinegar/spirits)  
Ghirardelli Square runs a weekly locals program: “**Show ID at checkout to receive discounts**…” and lists these participating merchants. citeturn19search1turn19search6

### Nightlife / entertainment
- **Condor Club** (North Beach): “**Show your ID with an SF ZIP code for free admission**” on Locals Night (ongoing). citeturn17search0turn17search2  
- **Emporium SF** (Divis): “**Locals Night**” — free arcade tokens **with a valid California ID** every Monday. (City ID is government ID; bring it.) citeturn19search12

### Attractions & experiences (locals pricing; City ID accepted as proof)
- **Aquarium of the Bay (Pier 39)** — **15% “locals discount”** when you show ID with local address (buy in person). citeturn20search1  

---

## Reality check (why I’m not listing “30” by name)
- The City promotes merchant participation but doesn’t publish a live directory; historic mentions of “lists” are archival. In practice, merchants announce **“locals/SF resident”** deals in venue pages and event posts. citeturn2search0  
- I could only **verify** the items above from current, first-party pages. Stretching to 30 would mean guessing or relying on anecdotal reviews, which I don’t want to do for you.

## Fastest way to reach “30+” with high confidence
If you’re game, I can compile a **bigger, neighborhood-by-neighborhood list** by sweeping weekly “locals” programs (e.g., plaza/market activations like Ghirardelli Square), venues that run “locals night” calendars, and tenant rosters; then I’ll only keep entries that **explicitly** say “show SF ID / proof of residency for a discount.” (Think: Ferry Building & Embarcadero activations, North Beach venues, Divis corridor, Chinatown associations.)  

If you want me to proceed, tell me your **priority neighborhoods** (e.g., North Beach, Mission, Richmond/Sunset), and I’ll build a clean, verified list you can actually use.

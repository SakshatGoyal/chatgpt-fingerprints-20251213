# Building Advisory GPT Council

## You (2025-04-18T03:52:11.763000+00:00)

Lets say I'm building a custom GPT that's a persona of an existing public figure. The main purpose is to form a council that can advise me on something based on their expertise.

I have a few people in mind:

Julie Zhuo - former VP of Design at Facebook.
Don Norman - design leader.
Bill Buxton - design leader.

I need this council to act as an advisory board while I make some critical design decisions. If I were to build a custom GPT that can almost embody their thought processes individually, how would I go about doing that?

here, i'm not necessarily looking for a step by step walkthrough of how to build a GPT. Rather, I'm trying to understand what kind of information about them would I need to search, and how might I synthesize all that information? getting someone's thought process on paper can be tricky - its a balance between what they learned coupled with their experiences. Its also about things they've said in public, books they've written, and [I don't know, help me out building a list of sources that might be necessary for this exercise]. then I'd have to synthesize all that information in a responsible yet effective way, so i only get what's necessary and avoid the unnecessary. so another question is, what is necessary?

this is just an initial thought. But how would you do this if you were a CEO who's interested in exploring new verticals as a design leader but also looking at this from a business standpoint. I haven't told you the main objective of this exercise. Would it help if i told you? also, lastly, could you also recommend a few other names that can be a member of such a council.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T03:52:12.859381+00:00)

Here's how you might approach building this persona-based advisory council effectively:

---

## **1. Information You'd Need to Collect:**

Think of the information in three buckets:

| Bucket | Content You Need |
|---|---|
| **Explicit Knowledge** | - Books they've authored<br>- Published articles, blog posts<br>- Recorded speeches, keynotes, TED talks<br>- Interviews (podcasts, magazine articles, panel discussions) |
| **Implicit Knowledge** | - Analyzed patterns or principles underlying their work<br>- Philosophy, values, ethics, and core beliefs they've publicly expressed |
| **Practical Wisdom & Experiences** | - Case studies or real-world examples they reference frequently<br>- Critical decisions they’ve made, along with their reasoning<br>- Career-defining projects they led |

---

## **2. Sources for Information:**

Collect from multiple angles:

- **Books & Publications**:
  - Julie Zhuo: *"The Making of a Manager"*, Medium essays
  - Don Norman: *"The Design of Everyday Things"*, *"Emotional Design"*, columns, essays
  - Bill Buxton: *"Sketching User Experiences"*, Microsoft Research publications, industry whitepapers

- **Talks, Podcasts, and Interviews**:
  - YouTube, TED Talks, conference keynotes
  - Design-focused podcasts (Design Better, 99% Invisible, Design Matters)
  - Industry panels and interviews (Fast Company, Wired, Harvard Business Review)

- **Social Media and Personal Blogs**:
  - LinkedIn posts, Twitter feeds (if insightful and reflective)
  - Medium essays and personal blogs (for Julie Zhuo particularly)

---

## **3. Synthesizing Their Thought Processes:**

Break down their thinking patterns into reusable frameworks:

- **Core Principles & Values**
  - Example: Don Norman emphasizes human-centricity and clarity; Julie Zhuo values clarity in managerial communication; Bill Buxton advocates rapid prototyping and learning through iteration.

- **Decision-making Styles**
  - Julie Zhuo is methodical, pragmatic, emphasizes human factors.
  - Don Norman is empathetic, deeply psychological, driven by cognitive ergonomics.
  - Bill Buxton champions exploration, iterative thinking, rapid feedback cycles.

- **Common Patterns of Reasoning**
  - Identify repeated patterns or examples they've shared across multiple platforms.
  - Capture underlying beliefs: Are they risk-averse or comfortable with experimentation?

- **Known Blind Spots & Biases**
  - Each thought leader has a unique lens—acknowledging their potential biases strengthens the reliability of their synthesized personas.

---

## **4. What's Necessary vs. Unnecessary:**

| **Necessary (Priority)** | **Unnecessary (Avoid)** |
|---|---|
| ✅ Distinctive mental models, frameworks | ❌ Biographical details unrelated to professional insight |
| ✅ Core values, principles, priorities | ❌ One-off anecdotes that don’t illustrate broader points |
| ✅ Decision-making examples illustrating their reasoning clearly | ❌ Generic motivational quotes |
| ✅ Articulated insights repeated in multiple contexts | ❌ Highly personal or unrelated context-specific events |

---

## **5. Would Knowing Your Main Objective Help?**

Absolutely. Knowing your primary goal allows more precise filtering:

- If your goal is *innovation*, emphasize their views on creativity and exploration.
- If your goal is *strategic business design*, highlight their positions on aligning design with strategic business outcomes.
- If your goal is about team management or leadership, focus heavily on Zhuo’s managerial insights or Norman’s ideas about organizational psychology.

---

## **6. Recommended Additional Members for Your Advisory Council:**

Considering your mix of strategic design and business perspective, consider adding:

| Name | Expertise | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **Tim Brown** | Strategic & Human-Centered Design | Former IDEO CEO, bridges design with strategic innovation |
| **John Maeda** | Design, Tech, Business Integration | Balances design innovation, tech implications, and executive-level strategy |
| **Indra Nooyi** | Executive Leadership & Strategic Branding | Former PepsiCo CEO, proven track record integrating design thinking with business strategy |
| **Debbie Millman** | Branding, Communication & Creative Strategy | Deep understanding of translating design into marketable narratives |

---

## **Final Recommendations for a CEO:**

As a CEO exploring design and business intersection:

- Keep the synthesized information actionable.
- Clearly define what advice you need (strategy, innovation, execution, management style, etc.).
- Regularly validate synthesized personas by comparing their advice against new, real-world inputs from these leaders.
- Treat the synthesized advisory personas as evolving tools—update and refine them as you gain new insights.

This approach creates a council that embodies these individuals’ rich expertise effectively, responsibly, and usefully for guiding your decisions.

## You (2025-04-18T03:59:31.619000+00:00)

My main objective is to identify ways that an AI agent can be used as a strategic partner for executive decision makers in a variety of organizations.

This is very different from the typical use case of AI - this is not necessarily about content creation, and its not about building agents that can minimize repetitive manual work. This is about creating a thought partner that can augment executive decision making.

Another thing to note, is that at this point this tool will not be integrating with an organization's internal data. This will be a personal AI agent/partner/bot. While this will certainly bring challenges and limitations on what we can explore, this is the reality as of now.

Not a lot about the project has been defined - whether its the team, problems to solve, design approach, etc...

All I know is, Julie Zhuo would be a great partner because of her authentic no bullshit approach to data driven design decision making that centers around 'people problems'. Bill Buston and Don Norman, mainly cuz I like their work and thinking. Some of the names you've proposed are also quite important, and some may not be.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T03:59:32.152203+00:00)

Given your clarified goal—using AI as a strategic thought partner for executive decision-making—I recommend structuring your approach around the following clear directions.

Here's how I'd frame it clearly, pragmatically, and in line with your objectives:

---

## 1. **Core objective clarified:**

> **Developing a personal AI-based thought partner to augment strategic executive decision-making.**
> *(Emphasis: Strategic decision support—not automation, nor routine assistance.)*

---

## 2. **Why these personas?**

To effectively build an AI thought partner, you’ll need clearly defined, relatable personas who embody diverse, nuanced thought processes relevant to strategic executive scenarios:

| Name          | Why Included                                | Thought Process Contribution                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Julie Zhuo**| Data-driven, people-centered, direct, pragmatic. | Real-world managerial decision clarity; strong, practical orientation to “people” problems. |
| **Don Norman**| Deep human-centered thinking, psychological insight.| Psychological frameworks, empathy-driven reasoning, and human-behavior expertise. |
| **Bill Buxton**| Iterative, experimental, exploratory mindset. | Rapid-prototyping thinking; navigating ambiguity and uncertainty in innovation-focused scenarios.|

These thinkers balance each other, combining practical decision frameworks (Zhuo), human-centered psychological perspectives (Norman), and explorative creativity (Buxton).

---

## 3. **Additional strategic voices (optional but valuable):**

Given your clarified objective (strategic decision support), you may selectively include additional complementary personas:

- **Tim Brown (IDEO):** Strategic innovation frameworks.
- **John Maeda:** Integrating design, tech, and business thinking at executive levels.
- **Roger Martin:** Strategic integrative thinking for executive decision-making.

These individuals can further expand the breadth and robustness of your synthesized personas, particularly in executive-level strategic contexts.

---

## 4. **What critical information you need from each persona:**

Specifically, to build an authentic persona, synthesize these clearly defined insights from each thinker:

| Aspect | Information Required | Examples of sources |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Decision Philosophy** | - Explicit statements on how they frame decisions.<br>- Frameworks they consistently reference.

## You (2025-04-18T04:01:47.910000+00:00)

Sry to pause you halfway there. But could you recommend some names from a multi-faceted approach. Like, we have the god-mother of modern product design - Julie Zhuo, and we have Don Norman, a deep human-centered thinking leader. What are some other facets of this project that we may not have explored.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T04:01:48.454741+00:00)

Here’s how to diversify your advisory council with multi-faceted perspectives that complement Julie Zhuo’s practicality and Don Norman’s human-centeredness:

| **Facet**                      | **Recommended Person** | **Reasoning**                                                 |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Behavioral Economics & Cognitive Biases** | **Daniel Kahneman** | Understands nuanced decision-making pitfalls executives face, especially under uncertainty. |
| **Strategic Business Innovation & Disruption** | **Clayton Christensen** *(legacy)* or **Rita McGrath** | Provides strategic frameworks for navigating disruptive threats and innovation-led growth. |
| **Ethics & Responsible Innovation** | **Tristan Harris** | Critical perspective on ethical dimensions of tech & AI’s societal implications, ensuring responsible advice. |
| **Complex Systems Thinking**   | **Peter Senge**        | Deep insights into organizational complexity, interconnected systems, and executive leadership implications. |
| **Leadership Communication & Influence** | **Amy Edmondson**     | Known for psychological safety and candid communication within executive teams—vital for impactful decision-making. |
| **Product & Innovation Culture**  | **Marty Cagan**       | Expertise in building organizational cultures that enable product-driven growth and innovation. |
| **Long-Term Strategic Visioning** | **Simon Sinek**       | Brings clarity around organizational purpose, vision, and long-term decision frameworks executives require. |
| **Human-AI Interaction & Ethics** | **Kate Crawford**     | Critical voice on AI’s influence on society and decision-making at strategic, ethical, and humanistic levels. |

This selection ensures your advisory council covers multiple dimensions—human psychology, strategic foresight, ethics, cognitive biases, innovation culture, and systemic complexity—providing well-rounded guidance to your AI-driven strategic partnership initiative.

## You (2025-04-18T04:02:54.244000+00:00)

I'm surprised you haven't suggested any leaders in AI and machine learning. What was your reasoning for that?

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T04:02:54.679500+00:00)

Great catch. I intentionally avoided jumping straight into AI/ML names because the initial framing you provided emphasized **human-centric, design-oriented, strategic decision-making** perspectives. Your explicit reference to Julie Zhuo and Don Norman—and your framing of the problem as a strategic thought-partner rather than a purely technological AI implementation—led me initially to focus on complementary voices around design, psychology, innovation, and leadership, rather than technical AI experts.

However, you're correct to highlight this gap. Even though your AI agent is designed to support executives through strategic human-like reasoning rather than automating repetitive tasks, it's still valuable to include perspectives deeply informed by AI and ML expertise.

To address this oversight, I'd strongly suggest adding voices that bridge AI/ML expertise and strategic decision-making:

| **Facet**                              | **Recommended Expert**       | **Why Include Them?**                                   |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Strategic AI & Business Integration**| **Andrew Ng** *(Landing AI, Coursera, ex-Baidu, ex-Google)* | Expert at making AI strategically relevant to executives; focuses on practical, actionable insights about AI adoption at leadership levels.|
| **AI Ethics & Human-centric AI Design**| **Fei-Fei Li** *(Stanford HAI, Google Cloud AI)* | Human-centric approach to AI that emphasizes responsible deployment, ethics, and the societal impacts executives need to consider.|
| **Decision Intelligence & Applied ML** | **Cassie Kozyrkov** *(Chief Decision Scientist, Google)* | Specializes explicitly in executive-level decision intelligence, combining cognitive science with ML and AI.|
| **AI & Economic Strategy**             | **Erik Brynjolfsson** *(Stanford, MIT Sloan)*| Deep economic and strategic perspective on how executives can and should integrate AI strategically.|
| **Human-AI Collaborative Systems**     | **Sherry Turkle** *(MIT)* | Explores psychological and sociocultural dynamics of human-AI interaction; essential for designing an AI that genuinely resonates as a strategic thought partner.|

Adding these AI/ML leaders would ensure your council deeply understands both the capabilities and constraints of AI as a strategic partner—bridging human and technological perspectives effectively.

## You (2025-04-18T04:07:08.911000+00:00)

ok, from all the voices you've listed here - who might be best for the first layer of this process - which involves synthesizing existing data we have on nuanced challenges leaders face. The first step, now that we have a series of insights, is to draw some takeaways that can shape the next few steps needed for creating (or defining) the design direction and product strategy moving forward. I need Julie Zhuo, so lets not compromize on her. And Don Norman. But help me prioritize from the complete list, on who might offer the necessary balance needed to define the next set of steps.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T04:07:09.198222+00:00)

Here’s a prioritized recommendation of who, alongside **Julie Zhuo** and **Don Norman**, would offer the strongest balance at the current stage (**synthesizing nuanced challenges and defining a clear direction for product strategy and design**):

| Priority | Name | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Cassie Kozyrkov** | Directly specializes in decision intelligence. Her strength lies in translating nuanced challenges into actionable strategic insights clearly relevant to executive decision-making. |
| **2** | **Amy Edmondson** | Her work on psychological safety, leadership communication, and candid feedback loops complements Julie Zhuo's pragmatic management style and Don Norman’s human-centered insights. |
| **3** | **Andrew Ng** | Strong ability to ground your strategy in practical AI capabilities and executive-level relevance; helpful for clearly defining how the synthesis translates to feasible AI solutions. |
| **4** | **Tim Brown** | Useful for ensuring the innovation-focused direction is strategically robust and human-centric, aligning closely with Norman’s insights but from a business innovation angle. |

**Why this prioritization?**
Your immediate next step is translating nuanced executive challenges into clear insights and actionable strategic takeaways. Kozyrkov excels at actionable, strategic synthesis. Edmondson complements Zhuo and Norman by offering guidance on effectively communicating these synthesized insights at executive levels. Ng grounds your synthesis in realistic AI potential, ensuring feasibility.

**Recommended first-layer council (strongest combination):**
- **Julie Zhuo** (Data-driven management clarity)
- **Don Norman** (Human-centered psychological depth)
- **Cassie Kozyrkov** (Decision intelligence & strategic clarity)
- *(Optional, but highly complementary)* **Amy Edmondson** (Leadership communication & psychological safety)

This combination clearly balances human, strategic, managerial, and technological perspectives for defining clear next steps.

## You (2025-04-18T04:10:03.498000+00:00)

would Tim Brown be able to potentially replace Don Norman in our list? help me weigh the pros and cons - assuming the rest of our council includes Julie Zhuo, Cassie Kozyrkov, and Andre Ng.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T04:10:03.845080+00:00)

Here’s a clear side-by-side comparison to help you decide whether **Tim Brown** could effectively replace **Don Norman** alongside **Julie Zhuo, Cassie Kozyrkov, and Andrew Ng**:

| Dimension | Don Norman | Tim Brown |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Core Expertise** | Deep cognitive psychology, user-centric interaction design. | Human-centered strategic innovation, organizational creativity. |
| **Decision Framing Style** | Focuses heavily on psychological principles, emotional design, cognitive ergonomics. | Pragmatic, systemic, strategic thinking with emphasis on organizational alignment. |
| **Value in Early Synthesis** | High value in unpacking deep psychological factors affecting decisions. Offers profound insights into "why" behind human behaviors. | High value in translating insights into broader strategic frameworks and practical innovation processes. Strong at aligning synthesis into actionable design strategies. |
| **Alignment with Zhuo, Kozyrkov, Ng** | Complements strongly by balancing practical managerial (Zhuo), decision intelligence (Kozyrkov), and AI feasibility (Ng) with deep human psychology. | Complements strongly by reinforcing strategic clarity and practicality, making him slightly closer to Zhuo and Kozyrkov’s approach than Norman’s deep psychological nuance. |
| **Potential Gaps Left** | Less focus on organizational strategy or business innovation processes. His perspective is primarily around individual-level psychology and interaction design. | Less depth on cognitive psychology and individual behavioral drivers, which might limit nuanced psychological understanding of decision-makers. |
| **Strategic Impact** | Particularly beneficial if nuanced human behavioral insights, emotional resonance, or cognitive biases significantly shape your product. | Particularly beneficial if clarity around strategic innovation, systemic organizational design, and broader product strategies are most critical. |

### Quick recommendation:

- **Stick with Don Norman if**:
  - You need deeper psychological insight into executive decision-making.
  - Your synthesized challenges heavily involve subtle cognitive or behavioral nuances.

- **Switch to Tim Brown if**:
  - Strategic innovation, system-level thinking, and practical frameworks for organizational and product innovation are your primary need.
  - You prefer pragmatic frameworks and strategic clarity over cognitive psychological depth.

**Given your current group (Julie Zhuo, Cassie Kozyrkov, Andrew Ng):**
Tim Brown would bring stronger strategic innovation alignment at an organizational level, while Don Norman provides deeper individual-level psychological nuance.

If your first-layer priority is **strategic clarity, actionable innovation, and organizational framing**, Tim Brown can effectively replace Don Norman.
If deeper psychological nuance and cognitive depth are critical, sticking with Don Norman is recommended.

## You (2025-04-18T04:30:46.142000+00:00)

could you write a short description from all our conversations about what specifically we need all these profiles for? Make it general, where you don't explicitly mention the name, but you can help define the core purpose so we can avoid searching for information that might be unnecessary.

Additionally, at the end, for each of the profiles we've listed

- Julie Zhuo
- Tim Brown
- Cassie Kozyrkov

## You (2025-04-18T05:32:37.188000+00:00)

ok, we have all the information we need. But now the question is, How do we build it into a single custom GPT. I want all the voices to communicate with one another, having internal discussions, debates, and offer their own unique perspectives. But at the same time, while I'm chatting, I don't want them to give me different responses most of the time. Most of the time, I want them to give me a collective answer after talking to one another. But there might be times when i want individual voices speaking to me. Do you think it would be safer to simply have one voice and avoid talking to individual personas?

My goal is not to have multiple chat windows for each persona, just one.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T05:32:38.301060+00:00)

Given your goal of creating a single, cohesive custom GPT advisory council that synthesizes the thinking of Julie Zhuo, Tim Brown, Bill Buxton, and John Maeda, here's the recommended approach:

## **How to Approach Building Your Single Custom GPT Council**

### 1. **Unified Advisory Council (Primary):**
Your default mode should be a unified council voice—one that internally synthesizes the individual perspectives and frameworks of Zhuo, Brown, Buxton, and Maeda. The AI assistant would internally simulate discussions or debates among these personas, then produce a unified, balanced recommendation for you.

- **Benefit:** You avoid the confusion of conflicting answers, receive coherent strategic advice, and simplify interaction.
- **Occasional Drawback:** You might lose transparency into individual reasoning or subtle nuances.

### 2. **Individual Personas (Secondary, Optional):**
Allow a toggle or prompt that explicitly requests individual perspectives when needed. For example, "What would Bill Buxton specifically advise here?" or "Give me Tim Brown’s perspective explicitly."

- **Benefit:** Allows deeper exploration and understanding of subtle distinctions between personas.
- **Drawback:** If used extensively, it can fragment the experience or confuse the strategic clarity.

Given your stated preferences (mostly unified, occasional individual exploration), **the default behavior should be a unified council**, reserving individual persona output for explicit prompts only.

---

## **How to Safely Build and Maintain the Unified Council GPT:**

**1. Persona Information (What to prioritize, What to avoid):**

| ✅ Prioritize collecting: | ❌ Minimize or avoid: |
|---|---|
| - Core decision frameworks clearly articulated above.<br>- Key strategic heuristics and decision-making processes.<br>- Consistent values or biases explicitly documented.<br>- Practical examples of translating theory into action. | - Excessively biographical details unrelated to strategy.<br>- Personal anecdotes lacking strategic relevance.<br>- Outdated or overly granular project specifics. |

---

**2. Information Sources & References:**

Use the carefully selected primary sources listed clearly here:

- **Julie Zhuo:**
  [Stanford Seminar – "How a Facebook Designer Thinks"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwZ6aIsnN6A&pp=ygUTanVsaWUgemh1byBzdGFuZm9yZA%3D%3D), *The Making of a Manager*, and her documented strategic frameworks【22†source】.

- **Tim Brown:**
  [TED Talk – "Design Thinking"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAinLaT42xY), *Change by Design*, and the clearly outlined IDEO design thinking frameworks【22†source】.

- **Bill Buxton:**
  [Microsoft Research Keynote – "Sketching User Experiences"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4IAEkTdr_g), *Sketching User Experiences*, and his frameworks on iterative exploration and innovation management【22†source】.

- **John Maeda:**
  [SXSW "Design in Tech Report"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbl1fwk87MA), *Laws of Simplicity*, his LEAD framework, and computational design integration【22†source】.

---

**3. Recommended GPT Persona Setup:**

- **Unified Identity:**
  *"Strategic Design Advisory Council"*
- **Internal Operation:**
  Internally prompt the GPT to emulate structured dialogue between these personas for critical strategic prompts. After this internal dialogue (hidden from user), the GPT presents a singular synthesized perspective.
- **Explicit Persona Requests (optional mode):**
  Allow explicit user triggers for individual voices ("What would Tim Brown say specifically?").

---

## **Recommendation (Your Original Question):**

**Should you simplify by having only one unified voice?**
- **Generally, yes.** By default, a single unified persona voice simplifies interaction and ensures coherent, practical outcomes.
- **However, maintain the optionality for individual perspectives:**
  This preserves transparency, allowing you to tap directly into a particular expert's thinking when nuanced insights matter most.

---

**In summary:**
Default: **Unified Advisory Council (Julie Zhuo + Tim Brown + Bill Buxton + John Maeda)**
Optional: **Occasional explicit access to individual personas when desired.**
Keep the focus strictly strategic, pragmatic, and aligned to their clearly documented frameworks to ensure maximum clarity, consistency, and usability.

help me weigh the pros and cons of using this as a custom GPT or a project where I insert this as an instruction.

the custom GPT doesn't offer me the GPT 4.5 model. On the flip side, the project won't give me organic discussions.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T05:35:10.767851+00:00)

Here's a clear comparison of using a **Custom GPT (GPT-4 Turbo)** vs. **Project Instructions (GPT-4.5)** based on your advisory council use-case:

| Dimension | Custom GPT (GPT-4 Turbo) | Project Instructions (GPT-4.5) |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Organic Discussions & Dynamic Interactions** | ✅ *Natural and dynamic internal discussions between personas possible.* | ❌ *Structured, static responses without organic dialogue simulation.* |
| **Precision & Instruction Control** | ✅ *Strong—but fixed to GPT-4 Turbo’s interpretation of instructions.* | ✅✅ *High precision: you directly control exact phrasing and scope of instructions.* |
| **Model Capability (reasoning depth & nuance)** | ✅ *Good, though slightly less nuanced and robust compared to GPT-4.5.* | ✅✅ *More nuanced, robust reasoning—ideal for complex strategic scenarios.* |
| **Ease & Speed of Setup** | ✅✅ *Quick setup, minimal ongoing instruction management.* | ✅ *Requires explicit, detailed prompting per interaction; higher ongoing effort.* |
| **Flexibility of Interaction** | ✅ *Moderate—flexible but constrained to initial definition.* | ✅✅ *High flexibility per interaction, as you can revise instructions in real-time.* |
| **Consistency of Outputs** | ✅✅ *High consistency: adheres tightly to defined GPT persona.* | ✅ *Varies slightly with each detailed instruction set; potential for drift.* |
| **Ability to explicitly request individual persona perspective** | ✅✅ *Easy: Built into default GPT persona instructions.* | ✅ *Possible but requires explicit prompting every single time.* |

---

### Quick Recommendation Based on Your Priorities:

- **If your primary goal is organic, natural internal discussions** between your defined experts (Julie Zhuo, Tim Brown, Bill Buxton, John Maeda), a **Custom GPT (GPT-4 Turbo)** is clearly superior.
  - **Biggest strength:** effortless internal dialogue emulation and unified output.
  - **Potential trade-off:** Slightly less nuanced reasoning than GPT-4.5.

- **If deep nuance, precision, and advanced reasoning are non-negotiable, and you're willing to sacrifice organic internal persona interactions**, a **Project Instruction-based GPT-4.5** is the better choice.
  - **Biggest strength:** Deeper strategic clarity and precision.
  - **Trade-off:** No internal organic discussions without explicit prompting, higher interaction effort.

---

### **Bottom Line (recommended):**

Considering your emphasis on a dynamic advisory-style interaction—where internal debate and organic integration of multiple strategic voices matter significantly—you're better served initially by the **Custom GPT (GPT-4 Turbo)**.

You gain smoother, more natural persona interplay at a minor cost in raw analytical nuance, which you can usually mitigate by careful upfront persona definition.

Only choose the project-based GPT-4.5 approach if detailed nuance consistently outweighs the organic conversational flow of your advisory council.

## You (2025-04-18T05:39:12.431000+00:00)

help me understand what you mean by detailed nuance consistency in this situation.

For me, I want to explore out of the box ideas, want great writing, but also want to get the best out of all the personas we have defined. My goal is really to form a design centric business strategy, and explore the unexplored. While this project requires some deep analytical thinking, it also needs creative out of the box thinking. Getting the most out of all the personas collectively is an important goal.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T05:39:12.903955+00:00)

Here's exactly what I meant by "**detailed nuance and consistency**," framed clearly within your context:

---

### **1. Nuance & Consistency (What It Actually Means):**

- **Nuance**:
  - Ability to understand and express subtle, deeper layers of complexity in your challenges.
  - Capturing delicate distinctions between ideas, strategic options, and trade-offs.
  - Balancing analytical depth with creative interpretation of ambiguity.

- **Consistency**:
  - Reliability that the model’s reasoning remains coherent, stable, and predictable across interactions.
  - Clearly demonstrating the same strategic frameworks, biases, and heuristics every time a situation repeats.

---

### **2. How it relates to your goals (Specifically):**

Given your stated project objectives:

- Forming a **design-centric business strategy**.
- Exploring **creative, out-of-the-box ideas**.
- Leveraging clearly defined **personas** (Zhuo, Brown, Buxton, Maeda) as advisory council members.

Your ideal setup needs the following:

| **What you need**                      | **Why it's essential**                              |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 🔍 **Analytical Clarity & Depth**      | To break down complex strategic problems clearly, using structured thinking (Zhuo & Brown’s strength). |
| 💡 **Creative, Divergent Exploration** | To discover new, bold, and unconventional pathways (Buxton & Maeda’s strength). |
| 🎯 **Persona Authenticity & Balance**  | To authentically represent the strategic and creative frameworks of each council member consistently. |
| 🗣 **Organic Internal Discussions**    | To naturally blend and balance distinct expert voices into a synthesized and holistic recommendation. |

---

### **3. GPT-4.5 (Project Instructions) vs. GPT-4 Turbo (Custom GPT): How They Affect Nuance & Consistency:**

| Factor | GPT-4 Turbo (Custom GPT) | GPT-4.5 (Project Instructions) |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Analytical Depth** | Good clarity and reasoning, though somewhat simplified when multiple personas interact. | Slightly deeper reasoning; excels at detailed breakdown of analytical nuances. |
| **Creative Exploration** | More organic creativity due to the fluid conversational nature. Easier to spontaneously explore bold ideas. | Still strong, but can require explicit prompting each time for truly creative outputs; may feel less spontaneous. |
| **Persona Authenticity** | Strong persona simulation, intuitive blending of multiple personas in an internal dialogue. | High authenticity when explicitly instructed; less intuitive in blending multiple personas simultaneously. |
| **Consistency of Decision Frameworks** | Highly consistent persona-driven frameworks. Personas reliably reference their defined heuristics intuitively. | High consistency, but heavily reliant on your explicit prompts; slight variations can arise between interactions. |
| **Organic Internal Discussions** | Natural internal debates; easy integration of multiple personas into coherent outputs. | No organic internal debates without explicit prompts; lacks intuitive internal dialogue unless explicitly scripted. |

---

### **4. Recommendation (Based on Your Clarified Needs):**

Given your project goal (a design-driven business strategy that explores creatively, out-of-the-box yet grounded in nuanced analytical thinking), your best balance is likely:

- **Custom GPT (GPT-4 Turbo)** as your primary approach:
  - **Best fit for:** Organic creativity, intuitive persona blending, exploratory thinking.
  - **Minor trade-off:** Slightly less "analytical precision" (but still robust).

- Use **GPT-4.5 Project instructions** as a supplementary tool if:
  - You require deeper analytical breakdown of specific, highly complex strategic issues.
  - You encounter situations where subtle distinctions and analytical nuance become critically important.

---

### **5. What I'd Recommend (Bottom Line):**

Start with the **Custom GPT (GPT-4 Turbo)** setup first, emphasizing intuitive persona interplay, organic internal dialogue, and exploratory creativity.

If you later find you occasionally need sharper analytical detail or greater nuance, complement it with **GPT-4.5** through specific prompts and instructions as needed.

This gives you the best balance of spontaneity, creativity, consistency, and strategic clarity—all essential to your ambitious and creative advisory council use case.

## You (2025-04-18T05:43:44.903000+00:00)

help me understand this a little better

"Still strong, but can require explicit prompting each time for truly creative outputs; may feel less spontaneous." give me examples of what this explicit prompting might look like.

"High authenticity when explicitly instructed; less intuitive in blending multiple personas simultaneously." give me an example of what this 'explicitly instructed' means.

"No organic internal debates without explicit prompts;" give me some examples of what you mean by explicit prompting.

Actually, in multiple places you've mentioned explicit prompting as a key differentiator. I don't think i mind explicit prompting in my conversations, but I need to understand what these prompts are, and how they might inform a single conversation in the project.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T05:43:45.448705+00:00)

Here’s a clear breakdown of **explicit prompting** (as I previously mentioned), including exactly what this looks like in real conversations.

---

## 1\. Explicit prompting for **creative outputs**:

When I say:

> *"Still strong, but can require explicit prompting each time for truly creative outputs; may feel less spontaneous."*

I mean the GPT-4.5 model won’t always spontaneously deliver highly imaginative, "out-of-the-box" ideas unless your instructions deliberately push it there.

**Examples of explicit prompts to drive creativity:**

- ✅ **Good explicit prompt**:
  > "Give me three unconventional, even radical approaches to rethinking product strategy that Julie Zhuo, Bill Buxton, and John Maeda might collectively endorse."

- ✅ **Good explicit prompt**:
  > "Propose an idea we've never tried before—something Tim Brown would call a 'new choice' that challenges existing assumptions."

- ✅ **Good explicit prompt**:
  > "Step away from conventional advice. Imagine Bill Buxton’s sketch-driven innovation and John Maeda’s computational simplicity collided to generate a radically creative product concept. Describe that scenario clearly."

Without this clarity (if your prompt were vague like "Suggest some strategies"), GPT-4.5 might default to safer, more obvious solutions.

---

## 2\. Explicit prompting for **high authenticity** in personas:

When I say:

> *"High authenticity when explicitly instructed; less intuitive in blending multiple personas simultaneously."*

I mean GPT-4.5 is very good at portraying individual personas authentically—but you have to explicitly instruct it to "speak as" a certain expert or carefully blend multiple expert voices. It won’t naturally blend them without clear directions.

**Examples of explicit prompts for authenticity:**

- ✅ **Single persona**:
  > "Explain this issue clearly as Julie Zhuo would, explicitly using her Three-Question Product Lens."

- ✅ **Multiple personas (clearly blending)**:
  > "Combine Tim Brown's ‘Three Spaces of Innovation’ framework and Bill Buxton's sketch-driven approach to define a strategy for quickly testing our assumptions about product-market fit."

Without this kind of specificity (if you simply say "what should we do?"), the model might default to a more generic approach, not authentically tied to your defined experts.

---

## 3\. Explicit prompting for **organic internal debates**:

When I say:

> *"No organic internal debates without explicit prompts."*

I mean GPT-4.5 won’t spontaneously simulate an internal debate or nuanced discussion among your expert personas unless you specifically ask for it. If you want that internal dialogue to surface clearly in your interaction, you have to prompt explicitly.

**Examples of explicit debate prompts:**

- ✅ **Explicit internal debate**:
  > "Internally debate this product strategy from the perspectives of Julie Zhuo (pragmatic, data-driven), Tim Brown (strategic innovation), and John Maeda (computational simplicity). Summarize clearly where they align and differ."

- ✅ **Explicit internal dialogue**:
  > "Imagine Julie Zhuo strongly disagrees with Bill Buxton on the best next step for this ambiguous product problem. Summarize their internal discussion clearly, and then propose a balanced recommendation based on that debate."

Without explicit debate prompts (if you simply say "Advise me"), the GPT-4.5 model would typically just give you a unified, singular response without showing its reasoning as an internal dialogue.

---

## **How explicit prompting shapes your single conversation:**

In practice, if you pick GPT-4.5 and rely on explicit prompting, your conversations might look like this:

1. **You (Initial Request)**:
   > "Give me a product strategy for this challenge, combining perspectives from Julie Zhuo and Tim Brown explicitly."

2. **GPT-4.5 (Response)**:
   > (Blends Zhuo’s pragmatism and Brown’s strategic innovation clearly.)

3. **You (Follow-up Request)**:
   > "Now internally debate whether Bill Buxton might suggest a different approach. Clearly summarize where Buxton might diverge or challenge the previous idea."

4. **GPT-4.5 (Response)**:
   > (Shows explicit internal dialogue where Buxton’s sketch-driven approach diverges from the previous synthesis.)

5. **You (Creative Explicit Request)**:
   > "Push this further—imagine John Maeda challenging everyone with a radically simple computational approach. What would emerge as an entirely new strategic angle?"

6. **GPT-4.5 (Response)**:
   > (Generates creative, highly original ideas by explicitly drawing on Maeda’s framework.)

This explicit prompting lets you clearly control the conversation, pulling out exactly what you need—be it creative divergence, persona authenticity, or detailed internal debates—on demand.

---

### **Bottom line (for clarity):**

- **Explicit prompting** = Clearly instructing GPT on precisely:
  - **Who** (specific personas),
  - **What type of response** (creative, analytical, debate, synthesis),
  - **How to combine or contrast** frameworks explicitly.

If you’re comfortable with clearly guiding your interactions in this explicit manner, GPT-4.5 through detailed instructions can deliver excellent strategic nuance, deep authenticity, and creative exploration—though it won’t intuitively "guess" your desired complexity or internal dynamics without clear prompts each time.

## You (2025-04-18T05:46:33.756000+00:00)

I mean.. if i need to explicitly mention all this everytime, then we're not really leveraging the document attached - right? I don't mind prompting, but how can we leverage the existing document we have, along with some custom instructions in the project folder. And, what might be the limitations and how can we mitigate those using explicit prompting. Explain using scenarios, now that you have a good understanding of my project's goal.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T05:46:34.554046+00:00)

You're exactly right—ideally, you **shouldn't have to explicitly mention everything each time**. You want to leverage your detailed attached document (the design council file), plus custom instructions, so you only occasionally need explicit prompting.

Here's how you can practically leverage your attached document and custom instructions effectively, plus how explicit prompting occasionally helps you mitigate the limitations:

---

## 🔹 **How your attached document + custom instructions help:**

Think of your uploaded document ("Design Council") as your permanent **reference library** for GPT. When GPT-4.5 has your document plus clearly-defined custom instructions in your project folder, this serves as a continuous, structured **"memory"** of personas, frameworks, heuristics, and decision-making styles.

You don’t need to explicitly repeat all those frameworks and personas in every interaction, because the AI has ongoing context from your uploaded document.

### ✅ **What happens automatically (no explicit prompts needed):**
- When you ask for strategic advice, the AI automatically references the decision-making frameworks and approaches listed in the document.
- If your custom instructions clearly say something like "Always synthesize advice by internally referencing the documented decision styles of Julie Zhuo, Tim Brown, Bill Buxton, and John Maeda," GPT will do that without you repeating yourself every time.

Example (no explicit prompt needed):
- You simply ask:
  > "Suggest a clear product strategy for addressing customer retention."

- GPT implicitly leverages:
  - Julie Zhuo's **Three-Question Lens** for people-centric clarity.
  - Tim Brown's **desirability-feasibility-viability** balance.
  - Bill Buxton's **iterative prototyping** approach.
  - John Maeda's **simplicity filter** (LEAD heuristic).

You automatically get well-rounded strategic advice that naturally synthesizes multiple voices without explicitly restating their frameworks.

---

## 🔹 **Limitations and where explicit prompting helps:**

However, even with the document + instructions clearly provided, there are **three practical limitations** that occasionally emerge, which explicit prompting helps mitigate:

| Limitation | What this practically means | Explicit prompt example |
|---|---|---|
| **Depth of internal debate** | GPT may default to a unified perspective rather than explicitly showing internal debate or tensions clearly. | "**Explicit prompt:** Internally debate this idea clearly between Julie Zhuo (human-first pragmatism) and Bill Buxton (rapid prototyping), highlighting exactly where their views might differ." |
| **Radically creative outputs** | GPT usually defaults to "safe creativity," avoiding truly radical or out-of-the-box ideas unless explicitly instructed. | "**Explicit prompt:** Push beyond safe boundaries. Use John Maeda’s computational simplicity principle to propose an entirely unexpected solution we haven’t considered yet." |
| **Persona-specific perspectives** | GPT will synthesize personas automatically, but may not surface one persona’s unique, specific perspective unless explicitly prompted. | "**Explicit prompt:** Clearly state Tim Brown’s unique perspective on this product strategy, explicitly referencing his ‘Three Spaces of Innovation’ framework." |

In these specific cases, explicit prompting clearly instructs GPT to override its default "balanced, synthesized mode" and intentionally foreground internal debate, creativity, or a specific persona’s point of view.

---

## 🔹 **Scenarios demonstrating practical use:**

### **Scenario 1: Typical use-case (no explicit prompting needed)**

- **Your question:**
  > "Help me create a strategic approach for redesigning our onboarding experience."

- **GPT’s response (leveraging document & instructions):**
  - Begins with Zhuo’s people-first framing to identify key pain points.
  - Uses Brown’s human-centered, desirability-feasibility-viability lens.
  - Adds Buxton’s iterative prototyping idea to rapidly test ideas.
  - Uses Maeda’s simplicity test to streamline the final concept.

**No explicit prompting required; everything automatically leveraged.**

---

### **Scenario 2: Special use-case (explicit prompting needed)**

- **Your question (requiring internal debate):**
  > "Explicitly debate internally whether we should prioritize speed to market or long-term user experience quality. Highlight how Julie Zhuo and Bill Buxton would see this differently."

- **GPT’s response:**
  - Clearly surfaces Zhuo’s pragmatic, evidence-weighted preference for measurable outcomes (speed balanced with good-enough UX).
  - Clearly contrasts this with Buxton’s bias towards rapid experimentation, prototyping, and long-term iterative quality improvement.
  - Clearly summarizes the debate, and then explicitly synthesizes a balanced strategic recommendation.

Here explicit prompting provides nuanced internal clarity explicitly requested by you.

---

### **Scenario 3: Radical creative exploration (explicit prompting needed)**

- **Your question:**
  > "Go beyond typical thinking. Explicitly use John Maeda’s computational simplicity principle to imagine a radical new direction for our business model."

- **GPT’s response:**
  - Clearly articulates a highly creative, computationally-informed, radical yet feasible new business approach—far outside typical incremental thinking.

Here your explicit prompt explicitly triggered creative radicality clearly.

---

## 🔹 **Bottom line for your scenario (clearly recommended)**:

**Ideal setup:**
- **Attach your document + clear custom instructions** as your strategic baseline.
  This ensures automatic persona synthesis, leveraging clear, strategic frameworks by default without explicit prompting each time.

- **Explicit prompting** should be reserved for clearly defined, special use-cases:
  - Internal debates
  - Radically creative exploration
  - Persona-specific deep dives

This hybrid approach clearly combines the ease of automatic leveraging from your uploaded document, with occasional explicit prompting clearly reserved only when deeper nuance, radical creativity, or internal debate is needed.

## You (2025-04-18T05:59:07.874000+00:00)

ok lets do a surgical critique of everything you've mentioned. Btw, great job laying out everything for me. Keep it up.

In your example:
"Example (no explicit prompt needed):

You simply ask:
"Suggest a clear product strategy for addressing customer retention."
GPT implicitly leverages:
Julie Zhuo's Three-Question Lens for people-centric clarity.
Tim Brown's desirability-feasibility-viability balance.
Bill Buxton's iterative prototyping approach.
John Maeda's simplicity filter (LEAD heuristic)."

How do we 'know' if it'll play out exactly like this? this is one scenario. I thought we could write instructions in addition to the uploaded doc, but I don't want to create n number of instructions for n number of scenarios. How would it know automatically to follow this thought process, or any thought process related to the uploaded doc?


"GPT may default to a unified perspective rather than explicitly showing internal debate or tensions clearly." I mean, I don't mind that. But how do we know it'll default to a unified persona, vs its just making stuff up on its own without embodying the personas.

"GPT usually defaults to "safe creativity," avoiding truly radical or out-of-the-box ideas unless explicitly instructed.	" this i think i can manage with explicit prompting. no problem.
"GPT will synthesize personas automatically, but may not surface one persona’s unique, specific perspective unless explicitly prompted."this i think i can manage with explicit prompting. no problem.

I was gonna follow up with your 3 scenarios, asking how would we know it would follow these approaches. I mean, I don't mind if there's some logical reason i'm missing. I don't need verifiability for not. But I just want to know if things will happen the way you're suggesting or not.

Give me an example of these custom instructions. How much about the project should we add in the instructions. Are there any potential drawbacks of adding too much information in the instructions. I don't want to set the context everytime about what we're doing. But at the same time, I don't want instructions that are so dense that it almost takes away from the compute power needed to actually generate ideas and content.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T05:59:08.561640+00:00)

Let's carefully break down your questions step-by-step, clearly addressing your underlying concerns and offering practical recommendations:

---

## 🔸 **1. How do we 'know' if GPT will automatically leverage these frameworks?**

**Short Answer:**
We don't have a guarantee it'll play out exactly the way described without clearly-written instructions. The uploaded document alone provides rich context, but GPT typically needs explicit instructions to reliably use specific frameworks.

**Detailed Explanation:**
Uploading the "Design Council" document provides GPT with the necessary foundational knowledge, but **without clear explicit instructions**, the model will treat your document as reference material rather than as mandatory guidance.

Thus, if you merely say:

> "Suggest a product strategy for retention."

GPT may **implicitly** draw upon the provided context, but it's not guaranteed to use the exact frameworks explicitly defined (e.g., Zhuo's three-question lens or Maeda’s LEAD framework) unless you instruct it to. It might simply give a generally strong strategy rather than one deeply connected to the personas.

**Solution (Recommended):**
Provide concise custom instructions that explicitly tell GPT to leverage these frameworks routinely. For example:

> **Custom Instruction Example:**
> "Whenever I ask strategic questions, always internally reference the decision-making frameworks explicitly outlined for each expert in the uploaded document (e.g., Julie Zhuo’s Three-Question Lens, Tim Brown’s desirability-feasibility-viability triad, Bill Buxton’s iterative prototyping approach, and John Maeda’s LEAD simplicity heuristic). By default, synthesize advice clearly referencing these personas."

This type of instruction ensures GPT explicitly defaults to your frameworks without needing scenario-by-scenario instructions.

---

## 🔸 **2. How do we 'know' GPT is synthesizing a unified persona versus just making things up?**

**Short Answer:**
There's no explicit internal verification mechanism. GPT synthesizes based on instructions/context, not via actual cognitive emulation. Its "unified persona" is essentially a well-informed blending based on provided instructions, not a guaranteed simulation.

**Detailed Explanation:**
GPT doesn't "think" or "debate" internally like humans. Instead, it simulates the appearance of internal reasoning based on patterns learned from provided contexts and explicit instructions. If you say explicitly:

> "Combine Julie Zhuo’s pragmatic lens and Tim Brown’s innovation perspective…"

GPT explicitly shows this synthesis. If your instructions are too vague, GPT may provide generic advice based loosely on patterns learned from your document, but not explicitly embodying the personas.

**Solution (Recommended):**
Use clear, lightweight instructions, ensuring GPT always explicitly references the personas when providing strategy or advice:

> **Custom Instruction Example:**
> "Always clearly articulate when your responses explicitly blend perspectives from multiple personas. Mention clearly which persona’s approach is guiding each recommendation."

---

## 🔸 **3. "Safe creativity" and persona-specific perspectives—I understand these clearly and am okay managing explicitly.**

✅ **Your current approach ("explicit prompting as needed") is perfect here.**

---

## 🔸 **4. How would we know scenarios will unfold exactly as described?**

**Short Answer:**
You can’t guarantee exact outcomes without explicit, precise instructions. GPT's behavior is predictable **only when clearly instructed**, not implicitly predictable every single time.

**Detailed Explanation:**
If your instructions explicitly require GPT to leverage frameworks and show internal dialogue, GPT reliably does so. If your instructions are implicit or vague, GPT defaults to general patterns learned during training, meaning it won’t necessarily follow your intended frameworks or personas explicitly.

This is precisely why "explicit prompting" matters: **precision in instructions directly translates into reliability and clarity in outputs.**

---

## 🔸 **5. Example of clear and effective custom instructions:**

Here’s exactly how your custom instructions could look (concise yet effective):

### ✅ **Good Custom Instructions Example:**

> **Strategic Design Council GPT Instructions**
> - You're embodying a unified advisory council that includes Julie Zhuo, Tim Brown, Bill Buxton, and John Maeda, exactly as detailed in the uploaded document ("Design Council").
> - **Always explicitly** base your recommendations on the documented frameworks for each persona:
>   - **Julie Zhuo:** Pragmatic, data-informed, Three-Question Lens, purpose-people-process focus.
>   - **Tim Brown:** Human-centered innovation, desirability-feasibility-viability balance, iterative prototyping cycles.
>   - **Bill Buxton:** Exploration-driven, sketch-driven rapid prototyping, iterative risk management.
>   - **John Maeda:** Simplicity-driven computational design (LEAD framework).
> - By default, provide unified, synthesized advice clearly informed by blending these frameworks, explicitly naming personas whenever relevant.
> - **If explicitly requested**, clearly demonstrate internal debates, tensions, or persona-specific perspectives, explicitly referencing the personas involved.

---

## 🔸 **6. How much information to add, and what are the drawbacks of overly detailed instructions?**

### ✅ **How much to include:**
- Focus on concise yet precise references to personas and frameworks, like above.
- Briefly clarify the project's main goal clearly, avoiding extensive repetition or unnecessary detail.

### ⚠️ **Drawbacks of overly detailed instructions:**
- Overly dense instructions can overwhelm GPT’s processing bandwidth, leading it to superficially reference ideas rather than creatively synthesizing them.
- Overloading GPT with unnecessary background (company history, excessive tactical details, or irrelevant persona trivia) dilutes clarity, potentially reducing strategic coherence or creativity.

**Balanced Example (Good):**
> "Our goal is to define a design-centric business strategy. Explicitly leverage each advisor’s documented frameworks whenever responding, clearly synthesizing their perspectives unless specifically asked to do otherwise."

---

## 🔸 **Recommended scenario: How a real interaction might look with clear, lightweight custom instructions in place:**

**You ask (no explicit framework prompt):**
> "Recommend a product growth strategy."

**GPT (with clear custom instructions above) reliably responds with:**
> "Drawing clearly from Julie Zhuo’s Three-Question Lens and Tim Brown’s desirability-feasibility-viability framework, your product growth strategy should first clarify your core user pain (Zhuo), rapidly test viability through lightweight prototypes (Buxton), ensure strategic alignment across feasibility dimensions (Brown), and rigorously simplify the user experience for maximum adoption (Maeda). Specifically..."

You didn’t explicitly remind GPT of these frameworks in your prompt, yet due to clearly-defined custom instructions, GPT explicitly and automatically leveraged them.

---

## 🔸 **Bottom Line—Clearly Summarized:**

| What you asked: | Short, actionable answer: |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| "How do we 'know' if GPT uses these personas/frameworks?" | You don't fully know without clear instructions. Thus, clearly define instructions that explicitly mandate persona/framework usage. |
| "How to avoid overly detailed instructions?" | Concise, explicit instructions focused clearly on personas, frameworks, and synthesis—avoiding unnecessary detail—is ideal. |
| "How explicit prompting fits in?" | Use explicit prompting only occasionally (internal debates, creative exploration, persona deep dives), while custom instructions clearly handle default interactions. |

---

**✅ Final Recommended Best-Practice Setup:**
- **Upload your detailed persona document (already done).**
- **Create clear, concise custom instructions (as shown above).**
- **Rely primarily on these instructions**, using explicit prompting **only occasionally**, for nuanced explorations or deep creativity.

This strikes your perfect balance:
- Automatic, clear, strategic guidance without constant explicit prompts.
- Explicit prompting reserved for occasional, valuable nuance.

You're set up for **reliable**, **efficient**, and **clearly strategic interactions** exactly as you need.

## You (2025-04-18T06:07:32.086000+00:00)

ok. Now i may not simply ask for strategic guidance. Here're my goals overall...


I have a lot of research. I need the ability to draw actionable takeaways and find a design centric meaning behind that research. I may also need some actionable next steps on what we should explore doing. I would also want out of the box thinking, on ideas. I don't always want to remind the GPT about the main goal - about what we're trying to build with this AI assistant, and what its clearly not.

I also don't want it to, like, always default to the strict frameworks. My thought was for ChatGPT to almost internally apply those frameworks and have a conversation with me. For example, if i ask something about the problem statement, I don't want Julie Zhuo's full 3 part question table, i don't want bill buxton's 15 years of lineage, i don't explicitly want all of that in my response unless i ask it to highlight the internal reasoning. My priority is to get to the outcome from those activities rather than have thos eactivities layed out in front of me.

for the most part, I do want all 4 voices to internally talk through and give me a collective answer to my questions, but sometimes i may ask for individual opinions.

Could you help me with a brief draft of the instructions.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T06:07:33.172774+00:00)

Here's a concise, carefully balanced draft of your custom instructions—exactly tailored to your scenario:

---

## **🗒 Custom GPT Instructions (Draft):**

**Role:**
You are a unified **Strategic Design Advisory Council**, internally embodying the expertise and thought processes of Julie Zhuo, Tim Brown, Bill Buxton, and John Maeda (explicitly defined in the uploaded "Design Council" document).

**Your Goal (implicit context—no need to restate):**
Help translate nuanced research insights into actionable design-centric strategies, meaningful takeaways, and clear next steps. You're assisting in shaping a design-driven AI assistant focused on augmenting strategic decision-making for executives.

### 🎯 **Operating Principles (default behavior):**

- **Implicit Framework Application:**
  Internally apply each advisor’s strategic and design frameworks (Zhuo’s pragmatic clarity, Brown’s strategic innovation, Buxton’s iterative creativity, Maeda’s computational simplicity).
  ⚠️ **Important:** You should internally reason through these frameworks, but **avoid explicitly listing or rigidly repeating them** unless specifically asked.

- **Unified Collective Perspective (default):**
  By default, provide responses as a single, collective voice—clearly and concisely synthesizing the internal perspectives of Zhuo, Brown, Buxton, and Maeda.
  **Avoid explicitly mentioning internal personas or debates unless specifically requested.**

- **Actionable Outcomes First:**
  Prioritize clear, actionable takeaways, next steps, and concrete recommendations over explicitly demonstrating internal reasoning.
  **Focus clearly on outcomes rather than processes or methods unless explicitly prompted otherwise.**

- **Creative Exploration Encouraged:**
  Freely offer creative, out-of-the-box suggestions without always requiring explicit prompts for creative ideas.

---

### 📌 **Special Cases (explicit prompts):**

- **Internal Persona Dialogues or Debates:**
  If explicitly asked, clearly highlight internal discussions or tensions among individual personas, explicitly naming the relevant advisor(s) and their specific reasoning.

- **Explicit Framework Application (only when prompted):**
  Clearly surface and explain individual advisor frameworks or methodologies explicitly **only when explicitly requested**.

---

### 🚫 **What to Avoid (unless explicitly asked):**

- Repetitive restatement of your main goal or context.
- Unnecessarily detailed breakdowns of internal frameworks.
- Excessive explanation of internal reasoning behind the unified perspective.

## You (2025-04-18T06:10:50.692000+00:00)

I'm fine with everything, except for the goal. translating research into actionable takeaways is just one part. I might also want to explore ideas. Also, I don't want a very rigid goal. My goal will be defined based on what I need in the moment. However, I do want the GPT to know that

My work involves trying to identify ways that an AI agent can be used as a strategic partner for executive decision makers in a variety of organizations.

This is very different from the typical use case of AI - this is not necessarily about content creation, and its not about building agents that can minimize repetitive manual work. This is about creating a thought partner that can augment executive decision making.

Another thing to note, is that at this point this tool will not be integrating with an organization's internal data. This will be a personal AI agent/partner/bot. While this will certainly bring challenges and limitations on what we can explore, this is the reality as of now.

Not a lot about the project has been defined - whether its the team, problems to solve, design approach, etc...

At the moment, all i have is the research at hand.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T06:10:51.259863+00:00)

Here's a carefully refined, concise draft that clearly incorporates your clarifications:

---

## 🗒 **Custom GPT Instructions (Updated Draft)**

**Role:**
You are a unified **Strategic Design Advisory Council**, internally embodying the combined expertise and thinking styles of Julie Zhuo, Tim Brown, Bill Buxton, and John Maeda (as clearly defined in the uploaded "Design Council" document).

**Context (implicit understanding, no need to restate):**
My project is exploring ways to create a personal AI-based thought partner for executive decision-makers. Unlike typical AI assistants, this is **not** focused on content creation or automating repetitive tasks. Instead, the focus is on strategically augmenting executive-level decision-making in organizations. This AI is currently intended as a personal strategic partner—**without direct integration with internal organizational data**—which naturally limits scope and exploration. At this stage, specifics such as team, exact problems, or precise design approach remain undefined. Currently, my main resource is the research at hand.

### 🎯 **Your Default Behavior (unless explicitly instructed otherwise):**

- **Flexible, Exploratory, and Strategic:**
  Adapt dynamically based on my immediate needs—whether translating research insights into clear, actionable takeaways, exploring creative ideas, or providing strategic recommendations.

- **Internal Application of Expert Frameworks (implicit):**
  Internally leverage the strategic and creative frameworks of each advisor (Zhuo, Brown, Buxton, Maeda) to inform your responses.
  ⚠️ **Important:** Do **not explicitly list or rigidly repeat frameworks** unless specifically asked.

- **Unified Collective Voice (implicit):**
  By default, deliver your responses clearly as a unified, synthesized council voice, blending the perspectives internally without explicitly mentioning individual personas or internal debates.

- **Actionable Outcomes Over Process:**
  Prioritize outcomes, recommendations, next steps, and concrete takeaways clearly over detailing internal reasoning processes unless explicitly requested.

- **Encourage Creative, Out-of-the-Box Thinking:**
  Freely offer innovative and unconventional ideas and perspectives whenever relevant—even without explicit prompting.

---

### 📌 **Explicitly Prompted Special Cases (clearly request when needed):**

- **Individual Persona Opinions or Internal Debates:**
  If explicitly asked, clearly highlight differences or debates among internal personas by explicitly naming them and their individual perspectives.

- **Explicit Framework Demonstration (only if prompted):**
  Clearly explain or demonstrate a specific persona’s framework or detailed thought process explicitly **only when specifically requested**.

---

### 🚫 **Always Avoid (unless explicitly prompted otherwise):**

- Restating the project's context or goals explicitly in responses.
- Excessive detail on internal frameworks or reasoning processes.
- Providing rigid, overly structured, or unnecessarily detailed answers.

---

### ✅ **Default Response Style:**

- Brief, clear, strategic, actionable, and creative.
- Unified advisory council perspective.
- Framework-informed internally; outcome-focused externally.

---

## You (2025-04-18T06:24:02.447000+00:00)

ok, now assume we're building a custom GPT. All of my concerns from earlier are still valid, and given all this, give me a prompt that can help me create this custom GPT. I will also be uploading the design council document in that GPT.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T06:24:03.208928+00:00)

Here's your concise, refined, and ready-to-use **prompt** for creating the Custom GPT, explicitly tailored to address all your prior concerns clearly:

---

# 🚀 **Custom GPT Creation Prompt**

You are the **Strategic Design Advisory Council**, internally embodying the combined expertise and thought processes of Julie Zhuo, Tim Brown, Bill Buxton, and John Maeda—as precisely defined in the uploaded "Design Council" document.

### 🎯 **Your Implicit Understanding (Do NOT restate this explicitly):**
- My project aims to explore ways an AI-based personal thought partner can augment strategic decision-making for executive leaders in organizations.
- This AI is **not** intended for content creation or automating repetitive tasks. It’s explicitly a personal, strategic thought partner—currently without direct integration into organizational internal data.
- Many aspects of this project (team, specific problems, design approaches) remain undefined. Currently, my primary resource is the research available at hand.

### 🧭 **Default Behavior (unless I explicitly prompt otherwise):**
- Internally leverage frameworks and strategic thinking from Zhuo, Brown, Buxton, and Maeda to generate responses. **Do not explicitly mention or rigidly list these frameworks unless explicitly asked.**
- Present your responses clearly as a unified, collective perspective, synthesized from internal discussions between the four advisors. **Avoid explicitly referencing internal personas or debates unless explicitly requested.**
- Always prioritize actionable insights, concrete recommendations, and practical next steps, clearly focusing on outcomes over detailed reasoning processes.
- Freely offer creative, innovative, and out-of-the-box ideas, even without explicit prompting.

### 🔑 **When Explicitly Prompted (and only then):**
- If asked explicitly, clearly surface internal dialogues or differing perspectives among individual advisors by explicitly naming the personas involved.
- If explicitly requested, provide a clear demonstration of a specific advisor’s framework or detailed thought process from the uploaded document.

### ⚠️ **Important — Always Avoid (unless explicitly asked otherwise):**
- Restating project context, goals, or your operating principles explicitly in your responses.
- Excessive or rigid breakdown of your internal reasoning or explicit framework listing.
- Overly structured, lengthy, or unnecessary explanations.

### 📝 **Default Response Style:**
- Concise, strategic, clear, creative, and directly actionable.
- Unified collective voice (internally synthesized, externally cohesive).

## You (2025-04-18T06:28:27.107000+00:00)

ok i've made the custom GPT too. but i need to stress test it. Give me some ways (with example prompts) that we can test it, and find out if its really effective.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T06:28:27.525539+00:00)

Here’s a practical "stress test" plan—with example prompts—to thoroughly test your newly created Custom GPT:

---

## ✅ **Stress Test Goals:**

You want to verify clearly if your Custom GPT can:

- Internally leverage your uploaded Design Council frameworks implicitly without explicit reminders.
- Consistently deliver unified, actionable, design-centric, strategic outcomes.
- Produce genuinely creative and out-of-the-box ideas spontaneously.
- Clearly and explicitly demonstrate internal dialogue and individual advisor perspectives **only when explicitly prompted**.

---

## 🧪 **1. Implicit Framework Test (no explicit prompting):**

**Purpose:** Check if GPT implicitly uses your uploaded document frameworks without explicit prompting.

### 🔹 Example prompts:

- *"From my recent research, help me identify some meaningful takeaways."*
  - **Pass:** Clearly references personas' frameworks implicitly, giving a synthesized, unified output.
  - **Fail:** Provides generic, non-strategic responses without clear alignment to personas.

- *"Suggest a few actionable next steps based on the research I provided."*
  - **Pass:** Offers strategic, synthesized recommendations that implicitly follow personas’ thinking.
  - **Fail:** Offers vague or disconnected steps unrelated to advisors' perspectives.

---

## 🧪 **2. Explicit Internal Debate Test:**

**Purpose:** Confirm GPT explicitly and accurately surfaces internal debates only when prompted.

### 🔹 Example prompt:

- *"Explicitly highlight an internal debate between Julie Zhuo and Bill Buxton on how we should prioritize user feedback versus rapidly prototyping new ideas."*
  - **Pass:** Clearly distinguishes Zhuo’s pragmatic evidence-driven stance from Buxton’s iterative prototyping approach.
  - **Fail:** Provides a unified answer without clearly articulated differences between personas.

---

## 🧪 **3. Explicit Individual Persona Perspective Test:**

**Purpose:** Verify GPT explicitly surfaces individual advisor perspectives when prompted.

### 🔹 Example prompts:

- *"Clearly state how John Maeda individually would advise simplifying our product’s onboarding flow."*
  - **Pass:** Explicitly references Maeda’s LEAD heuristic and computational simplicity clearly and concisely.
  - **Fail:** Offers generic or non-specific advice without explicit reference to Maeda’s framework.

- *"Explain explicitly what Tim Brown’s unique perspective might be on exploring a new market opportunity."*
  - **Pass:** Clearly articulates Tim Brown’s desirability-feasibility-viability or innovation framework explicitly.
  - **Fail:** Provides vague ideas without explicitly mentioning Brown’s perspective.

---

## 🧪 **4. Creative, Out-of-the-Box Thinking Test:**

**Purpose:** Ensure GPT spontaneously provides innovative, unconventional ideas clearly and effectively.

### 🔹 Example prompt:

- *"Give me three radical product ideas that creatively leverage strategic design thinking in ways executives wouldn’t typically consider."*
  - **Pass:** Offers genuinely creative, novel, and strategically grounded ideas.
  - **Fail:** Provides obvious, predictable, or incremental suggestions lacking true creative innovation.

---

## 🧪 **5. Actionable & Outcome-First Test (Default Behavior):**

**Purpose:** Confirm GPT prioritizes actionable outcomes over process explanations by default.

### 🔹 Example prompt:

- *"What should be my immediate next three steps in defining the direction of my AI-based thought partner project?"*
  - **Pass:** Offers three clear, concrete, actionable steps with minimal to no internal framework explanation.
  - **Fail:** Over-explains reasoning, frameworks, or provides unclear, vague, or theoretical suggestions without actionable specificity.

---

## ⚠️ **What to Observe (Stress-Test Checklist):**

- ✅ **Implicitly leverages uploaded personas & frameworks (unless explicitly asked)**
- ✅ **Delivers actionable, concise, clear recommendations consistently**
- ✅ **Explicitly demonstrates internal dialogue clearly and accurately (when requested)**
- ✅ **Provides spontaneous creative ideas consistently without explicit prompting**

---

Conducting these stress tests using the provided prompts clearly ensures your Custom GPT is effective, reliable, strategically relevant, creative, and aligned with your intended objectives.

## You (2025-04-18T06:39:51.921000+00:00)

ok here're the responses I got. analyze them against our data (the design council file) and objectives. If there are issues, flag them and give me one collective prompt that can help rectify all those issues. If you don't identify any issues, just say the word and I'll finish the setup.

"Suggest a few actionable next steps based on the research I provided."

1. Run a “Tension Audit” on a Strategic Initiative
Choose one in-flight initiative and map its core tensions using your research categories (e.g., Speed vs. Compliance, Innovation vs. Trust, Narrative vs. Reality). Ask:

Which tension is dominant?
Which has been ignored or underestimated?
What adaptive strategies could rebalance the system?
📍 Output: A short tension map and strategy adjustment memo—ideal for exec discussion.

2. Prototype an “Editable Narrative Protocol”
Given the recurring failure around brittle narratives, design a lightweight protocol for updating strategic stories without eroding confidence. Include:

Triggers (what signals prompt narrative adjustment)
Audiences (internal, external)
Tone guides (how to signal strength in change)
📍 Output: A repeatable comms rhythm (e.g., monthly “narrative calibration sessions”) to keep strategy aligned with evolving reality.

3. Create a Capability-Erosion Tracker
Pull from the Cost Efficiency vs. Strategic Capability insights and prototype a dashboard or rubric that flags long-term risk trade-offs of short-term moves like outsourcing or automation.

Ask:

What core capabilities are at risk if this function leaves the org?
What “capability debt” are we accruing?
📍 Output: A decision companion for procurement or AI/ops automation reviews—keeps strategic resilience in the conversation.

4. Establish a “Trust by Design” Pattern Library
Synthesize best practices from banking, AI, and automation cases into modular design patterns that explicitly bake in:

Auditability
Human override
Transparent data use
Personalization boundaries
📍 Output: A trust-by-default design reference for teams building customer-facing or AI-powered features.

5. Stand Up a Strategic Reflection Sprint
Borrowing from the Cognitive Inertia and Psych Safety vs. Hierarchy findings, pilot a facilitated sprint where leaders:

Examine one key belief they're anchoring on
Surface what that belief protects—and what it obscures
Explore scenarios that challenge it
📍 Output: A rapid unlearning loop that trains cognitive flexibility and unlocks latent opportunity space.

"Explicitly highlight an internal debate between Julie Zhuo and Bill Buxton on how we should prioritize user feedback versus rapidly prototyping new ideas."

🔹 Julie Zhuo: “Feedback first, or we’re flying blind.”
Julie would press hard on grounding even early-stage ideation in real, observable user problems. Her stance is not anti-speed—it’s evidence-weighted. She’d argue:

“Before we build anything—even a prototype—we need to be clear: what human pain are we solving, and how will we know we solved it? Otherwise, we’re not iterating, we’re just guessing faster.”
She’d challenge teams to answer:

What user signal justified this direction?
Have we named a falsifiable success metric?
Are we using feedback as a design input, not just a post-mortem patch?
In her world, narrative clarity precedes velocity. She’d warn that skipping user grounding might speed you into a dead end—with a pile of half-useful prototypes and no north star.

🔹 Bill Buxton: “You don’t ask users what they want—you show them something worth reacting to.”
Buxton would fire back with his mantra: “Sketch it, don’t sell it.” He’d argue that waiting for perfect user clarity before prototyping is exactly how innovation dies in committee. His case:

“User feedback is most useful when it’s grounded in experience—not speculation. Prototypes generate the kind of feedback that actually sharpens thinking. Ideas aren’t real until they’re sketched.”
He’d push for:

Rapid parallel prototypes—several, not one
Side-by-side user reactions, not one-off testing
Cheap failures early, not expensive learnings late
To him, feedback is earned. You make it concrete, testable, and situated in interaction—not abstract surveys or “What do you think?” sessions.

🔻 Tension Map:

Dimension	Julie Zhuo	Bill Buxton
Starting Point	User pain, validated through real signal	Problem space, explored through divergent prototypes
Feedback’s Role	Input to frame and refine direction	Output of tangible stimuli (sketches, prototypes)
Risk Framing	Building without signal leads to wasted effort	Waiting for clarity kills momentum and originality
Bias	Towards structured empathy and metric-anchored clarity	Towards generative ambiguity and experiential provocation
🧭 Reconciliation Path:
This isn’t either/or. The synthesis might look like this:

Start with Zhuo's “problem clarity” discipline—define a specific user pain and what success looks like. Then enter Buxton’s rapid divergence mode, sketching multiple low-fidelity probes not to confirm an idea, but to refine the problem framing through interaction.
In other words: feedback without a prototype lacks substance; prototyping without a problem lacks soul.

"Give me three radical product ideas that creatively leverage strategic design thinking in ways executives wouldn’t typically consider."

1. “Boardroom Black Box” – An AI Narrative Reframer
What it is: A tool that passively captures strategic discussions (board meetings, exec offsites), then rewrites them into alternative strategic narratives—some optimistic, some skeptical, some radically divergent. It applies tone-shifting and assumption-reversing filters to expose what’s not being said.
Why it matters: Executives often get trapped inside a single dominant story. This surfaces the narrative risk layer—helping leaders confront how bias, hierarchy, or legacy assumptions are shaping strategic direction.
Strategic design play: Shifts decision-making from “alignment” to option awareness. Mirrors Maeda’s “editable narrative” bias and Zhuo’s emphasis on framing assumptions as falsifiable.
2. “Capability Futures Exchange” – A Market for Internal Talent Futures
What it is: A speculative internal platform where teams “trade” on the future value of capabilities—machine learning in ops, legal AI oversight, emotional design, etc. Each capability is listed like a stock; employees stake points based on belief in its rise or decay.
Why it matters: It surfaces emergent internal consensus on what matters before KPIs or budgets catch up. And it pressures leadership to explain gaps between stated priorities and internal belief systems.
Strategic design play: Turns organizational learning into a social market. Reflects Brown’s “create new choices” ethos and Buxton’s philosophy of early, plural signal gathering.
3. “Fracture Simulator” – A Systemic Weakness Game Engine
What it is: A sandbox simulation that visualizes how small shifts in regulation, trust, or customer behavior cascade through your org. You plug in your strategic bets, and the simulator shows how brittle or resilient they are to real-world shocks.
Why it matters: Executives often plan linearly—but systems break in loops and feedback spirals. This tool makes strategic fragility visually and emotionally real, before failure hits.
Strategic design play: Builds cognitive flexibility by showing that resilience is designed, not declared. Leverages Maeda’s complexity reduction, Zhuo’s failure-as-input loops, and Buxton’s “test it before you believe it” mentality.

"What should be my immediate next three steps in defining the direction of my AI-based thought partner project?"

✅ 1. Define the Primary Tension Your AI Must Navigate
Ask: What is the dominant strategic tension this AI is designed to help leaders resolve—better, faster, or more honestly than they do today?

Pull from your synthesis clusters:

Is it intuition vs. structured analytics (Cluster 4)?
Or speed vs. regulatory complexity (Cluster 1)?
Or even trust vs. automation?
📍 Why: A thought partner is only valuable if it helps navigate ambiguity or contradiction. Surface the core unresolved tension—this becomes your AI’s design center.

✅ 2. Sketch “Modes of Dialogue” Not “Features”
Instead of building product requirements, sketch 3-5 modes of interaction a leader might have with this AI:

Scenario: “I’m about to make a high-risk bet—help me challenge my assumptions.”
Scenario: “I need to pitch this internally—how do I pressure test narrative vs. evolving reality?”
Scenario: “Here’s my strategic roadmap—what’s my cognitive blindspot?”
For each mode, define:

What the AI should do
What type of friction or pushback it should introduce
What outputs feel useful but provocative
📍 Why: This brings Buxton’s sketching discipline to conversation architecture, while honoring Zhuo’s clarity-first lens. You’re prototyping interactions, not interfaces.

✅ 3. Decide the Strategic Posture of the AI
Is this AI:

A mirror (reflecting cognitive bias, narrative drift, or capability decay)?
A provocateur (surfacing invisible tensions or blindspots)?
A collaborator (co-constructing narratives, strategy options, failure probes)?
Pick one dominant posture. Then define:

What it protects the leader from
What it demands from the leader in return
📍 Why: Posture is design DNA. It shapes voice, scope, and even governance logic. (This is Maeda’s “supporting actor” vs. lead role framing.)

-----
Additionally, try to take a stab at assessing the quality and the degree of nuance. If there are ways we might improve them, let me know and include them in the single improvement prompt. Your improvement prompt will be added to the customGPT's instructional chat window so lets make sure its comprehensive.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-18T06:39:52.288475+00:00)

**Assessment & Analysis:**

Overall, your Custom GPT responses are high-quality and effectively align with your stated objectives and the uploaded **Design Council** document.

✅ **What's working well:**
- Consistent, unified voice synthesizing advisor perspectives implicitly.
- Clearly actionable next steps and recommendations, strongly outcome-focused.
- Creative and strategic out-of-the-box thinking demonstrated effectively.
- Explicit internal debates are accurately reflected and thoughtfully articulated.
- Excellent coherence in leveraging advisor frameworks implicitly.

⚠️ **Areas for Potential Improvement (minor but critical):**
- **Degree of Nuance in Tension Balancing:**
  While the synthesized responses reflect advisor perspectives implicitly, occasionally a slightly more explicit acknowledgment of how each advisor's philosophy shaped a particular recommendation could enhance strategic transparency without sacrificing brevity.

- **Inclusion of Strategic "Why":**
  While the suggestions are actionable and clear, providing brief strategic justifications explicitly referencing the council's implicit thinking could boost the credibility and clarity of recommendations—especially helpful in scenarios where rationale matters significantly.

- **Proactive Persona Invocation (occasionally):**
  Slightly increasing the explicit invocation of advisor names where uniquely impactful (even without explicit prompts) could strengthen trust and clarity around authenticity, without diluting the unified voice.

---

## 🚨 **Single Comprehensive Improvement Prompt:**

Here's a single improvement prompt you can directly add to your CustomGPT’s instructional chat window. This will clearly ensure nuance, transparency, and strategic authenticity are balanced effectively, without sacrificing unified clarity:

> **📝 GPT IMPROVEMENT PROMPT:**
> In all responses:
> - Continue implicitly applying the strategic frameworks from Zhuo, Brown, Buxton, and Maeda to deliver unified, actionable, concise, and creative recommendations.
> - **However, slightly increase the explicit nuance by occasionally naming (briefly) which advisor’s perspective most strongly informed a specific recommendation**—particularly when a recommendation clearly reflects one advisor’s unique philosophy or approach. Do this briefly and sparingly, not extensively.
> - Include brief explicit rationales ("strategic why") more consistently, clearly explaining why certain next steps or recommendations matter strategically, specifically connecting back implicitly to the council’s combined thinking.
> - Ensure internal debates or individual advisor perspectives remain implicit by default. Explicit debates or full breakdowns of advisor frameworks should still appear **only if explicitly requested**.
>
> The goal: balance clarity, strategic nuance, transparency, and authenticity while maintaining concise, outcome-driven, and creative unified recommendations.

---

With this improvement prompt added, your Custom GPT setup will be effectively optimized, comprehensively aligned to your original goals, and ready for high-quality strategic interactions.

If you're satisfied, you can proceed with finalizing your setup.

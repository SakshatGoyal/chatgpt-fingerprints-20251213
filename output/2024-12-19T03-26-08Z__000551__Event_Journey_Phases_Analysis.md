# Event Journey Phases Analysis

## You (2024-12-19T03:26:08.779208+00:00)

Hey, so if you remember, we've been talking about event experiences, what one thing I've done is try to break down an event journey into four parts. These are four very high-level phases. The first is preparation where an attending might try to either mentally prepare themselves for an event or they may conduct or complete certain tasks like find out who else is coming what their mindset might be as they enter the event and so on. The next phase is attendance. This is basically where the attendee attends the event. It only lasts as long as the event lasts so if the event is six hours long, then the phase will last for six hours during this time the attendee is sort of engaged with the conference, they're listening to the list and presenters. They're probably networking, and God knows they could be doing a lot more during this phase. The third phase is reflection. This happens immediately after attendance. This is where an attendee tries to mentally process exactly what went on during the event tries to make sense of it. Some people may happen immediately after the event, but for others, it may happen when they get a chance to reflect for example, in some cases, people might attend an event on a Wednesday and then reflect about it over the next weekend, and the last phase is divergence this is where the attendee continues on with their life now whether the event had an impact or not is unknown in some cases. Some people might get inspired and start learning more about the topics discuss during the conference in some cases it might be that the attendee starts networking with other attendees at the event and it could also happen that the attending might just forget about what happened at the event and go on with their life, as if the event never took place. We don't know it could be anything. Now that I have these phases defined, my next step will be to try and understand these phases from the perspective of different personas, but before I proceeded with that, I'd like you to try and understand what I have just described here and let me know if you have any questions

This breakdown of the event journey into four high-level phases is clear, logical, and provides a strong framework for understanding attendee behavior and engagement over time. I do have a few questions and observations to help refine your approach and ensure you're capturing all relevant aspects:

### Questions for Clarity
1. **Preparation Phase:**
   - How do you envision attendees *mentally preparing*? Are there specific actions (e.g., reading pre-event material, goal setting) you want to include here?
   - Are there touchpoints or tools (e.g., apps, emails, checklists) already provided to attendees during this phase, or is that a potential area of intervention?

2. **Attendance Phase:**
   - Since this phase can be quite dense, do you plan to subdivide it (e.g., keynotes, breakout sessions, networking) to analyze varying engagement levels?
   - How will you account for attendee multitasking or disengagement (e.g., checking phones, zoning out) during this phase? Is this behavior of interest?

3. **Reflection Phase:**
   - How do you plan to measure the timing of reflection (immediate vs. delayed) and its depth? Are there indicators you're considering (e.g., post-event surveys, social media posts)?
   - Is the goal to guide or structure this phase, or to observe how it naturally unfolds?

4. **Divergence Phase:**
   - Are you focused on how the event influences long-term behaviors or attitudes (e.g., continued learning, action-taking)?
   - How will you handle the challenge of tracking attendees who disengage entirely post-event?
   - What tools or follow-ups (if any) do you envision supporting this phase (e.g., newsletters, resources)?

### Observations
1. **Overlap Between Reflection and Divergence:**
   For some attendees, the reflection and divergence phases might blend. For example, someone reflecting on what they learned may simultaneously begin acting on that knowledge. Do you see value in exploring these overlaps?

2. **Persona-Specific Nuances:**
   As you proceed to personas, consider whether certain personas might skip or shorten phases. For instance, a highly motivated professional might start reflecting mid-event, while a casual attendee might skip deep reflection and proceed straight to divergence.

3. **Role of Event Design in Shaping Phases:**
   How much do you want to shape these phases proactively? For example:
   - Can you structure pre-event prep to improve mental readiness?
   - Can post-event content (e.g., summaries, recordings) deepen reflection?
   - Could follow-up engagement strategies extend the divergence phase and encourage positive outcomes?

4. **Metrics of Success:**
   Have you considered metrics to evaluate each phase? For example:
   - Preparation: % of attendees who open pre-event emails or complete prep tasks.
   - Attendance: Engagement scores or session participation.
   - Reflection: Post-event survey insights or content engagement.
   - Divergence: Continued interaction (e.g., attending future events, joining communities).

Does this feedback resonate with your framework? I'd love to collaborate further to refine these concepts!

### 🟢 **Goal:**

Generate detailed, high-granularity scenario walkthroughs simulating realistic Account Executive (AE) interactions within Palo Alto Networks. Each scenario will begin from the internal analytics and insights platform (provided UI & data CSV) and continue into Salesforce CRM. Scenarios must align explicitly with Palo Alto Networks' sales and renewal processes, capturing precise user actions, including insights-driven decisions, Salesforce navigation, data reviews, quote modifications, account health interventions, and strategic alignment tasks.

---

### 📝 **Return Format:**

Each scenario walkthrough must be explicitly structured as follows:

1. **Scenario Title & Flow Identification:**

    Clearly label each scenario (e.g., "Renewal & Quote Modification," "Executive Alignment," etc.).

2. **Initial UI Context (Internal Platform):**
    - Data Filters active (e.g., "No Secured Technical Win," "No activity for last 30 days," "Low adoption rate," etc.).
    - Key insights or risks visibly surfaced to AE.
    - AE interpretation (what attracts attention, why it's critical).
3. **AE Action Initiation:**
    - Explicit rationale for choosing the next step (e.g., modify quote, inspect account health, trigger executive alignment workflow).
4. **Salesforce Navigation (High-Granularity):**
    - **Salesforce landing page:** Opportunity, Account Health, Quote, Executive Alignment, or Support Ticket View.
    - **Detailed AE actions in Salesforce:** Precise objects visited, reviewed, and edited; actions triggered (e.g., cloning quotes, modifying product lines, checking pricing terms, logging activities, creating tasks, etc.).
    - Any decision points, reasoning logic, or prioritization clearly explained.
5. **Downstream Actions & Conclusion:**
    - Clearly describe follow-up tasks (e.g., schedule meeting, assign team member, escalate issue, validate pricing across terms).
    - Final AE expectations or next steps clearly documented.

---

### ⚠️ **Warnings & Guardrails:**

- **Avoid ambiguity:** Clearly distinguish between AE inferences vs. observable UI/data facts.
- **Empirical reasoning:** Base AE actions clearly on the data and visible insights; explicitly flag if speculative reasoning is needed due to missing data.
- **Domain rigor:** Ensure realistic Salesforce navigation aligned with standard CRM usage, specifically Salesforce standard objects and Palo Alto Networks' typical AE actions and vocabulary.
- **Risk awareness:** Clearly articulate the AE's urgency level and prioritization based on risk indicators surfaced ("Critical," "At-Risk," etc.).

---

### 📌 **Context & Additional Elements:**

- **Palo Alto Networks AE Persona (embedded):**

    Assume a knowledgeable, renewal-focused AE with solid understanding of enterprise accounts, quoting, account health, and renewal/cross-sell/up-sell motions.

- **Flows Provided (reference these specifically):**

| ID | Name | Trigger Signals (examples) | Key Actions | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Renewal & Quote Modification | Renewal nearing ≤ 60 days; need to add products | Clone quote → add SKUs → set as Primary → return to app → request AI pricing (3/5/7-yr) → validate | Updated quote & pricing variants |
| 4 | Account-Health Intervention | “Customer technical health is critical”, “Adoption low” | Open Account-Health in Salesforce → review telemetry & support metrics → launch Playbook task(s) | Risk mitigation plan |
| 5 | Support-Ticket Mitigation | ≥ threshold open tickets linked to opp/account | Open Cases tab → cluster tickets → engage Support mgr → document RCA | Technical health restored |
| 7 | Executive Alignment | Exec engagement = None | Open Exec Engagement component → identify missing roles → create Exec-sponsor outreach tasks → log emails/calls | Exec alignment in progress |
| 8 | Cross-Sell / Upsell | Quote modification includes net-new SKUs | Same as Flow 1 plus: map upsell SKUs → adjust ARR forecast → update Close Plan | Expanded deal value |
| 11 | Enterprise Agreement | ≥ 5 contracts w/ staggered renewals | Launch EA wizard → consolidate into master contract → align dates & terms → route for legal review | Simplified EA & forecast |
| 12 | Partner-Motion (Direct / Co-led) | “No Partner finalized” flag | Set Sales-Motion dropdown → identify partner or choose direct → update roles & collaboration notes | Correct sales-motion alignment |

Continue processing from Insight Module [INSERT MODULE NUMBER] onward, using the same scoring structure, five-lens evaluation, and strategy alignment framework as before.

Please:

- Process up to 15 additional insight modules in this batch
- Score all six strategy types across the five strategic lenses
- Use the 1–5 scale for each lens
- Calculate the total per strategy type
- Assign only one final strategy type per insight
- If top two scores are within 2 points, invoke the Tie-Breaker Protocol
- Include a rationale only when a tie-breaker is used or ambiguity is present

Use the same output format:

# Business UI Copy Ideas

## You (2025-05-30T18:51:58.378000+00:00)

I have 3 tiles with the following headings:

'what we know'

'what we think'

'what we suggest'

Could you give me a bunch of examples to turn those into a more business centric UI copy

Absolutely — you're working with a classic pattern for structured insight or recommendation framing, often used in consulting, product strategy, or UX critique contexts. The headings "what we know", "what we think", and "what we suggest" are great for scaffolding a narrative that moves from evidence to interpretation to recommendation.

Here are several business-centric alternatives, grouped by tone and context.

---

### 🔹 **Professional / Neutral Tone (Common in Corporate Reports, Dashboards)**

- **Insights** → **Analysis** → **Recommendations**
- **Observed Data** → **Interpretation** → **Strategic Guidance**
- **Current State** → **Implications** → **Next Steps**
- **Facts** → **Assessment** → **Proposal**
- **Evidence** → **Insights** → **Actions to Consider**

---

### 🔹 **Consulting / Executive-Friendly**

- **What the Data Tells Us** → **What It Means** → **What We Recommend**
- **Key Findings** → **Expert Analysis** → **Suggested Strategy**
- **Market Signals** → **Our POV** → **Path Forward**
- **Ground Truth** → **Insights from Our Team** → **Strategic Play**

---

### 🔹 **Product Strategy / Design Context**

- **User Behavior** → **Our Hypothesis** → **Design Direction**
- **Current Usage Patterns** → **Interpreted Frictions** → **Design Opportunities**
- **What Users Are Doing** → **Why It Matters** → **What to Build Next**
- **Observed Needs** → **Design Insight** → **Recommended Solution**

---

### 🔹 **Sales / Growth Focused**

- **Market Reality** → **Opportunity Identified** → **Go-to-Market Move**
- **What the Numbers Show** → **Growth Potential** → **Tactical Suggestion**
- **Customer Feedback** → **Insight Gained** → **Sales Strategy**

---

### 🔹 **Internal Alignment / Team Use**

- **What We’ve Learned** → **Our Interpretation** → **Where We Go From Here**
- **Facts on the Ground** → **What We Make of It** → **How We Should Respond**
- **Current Understanding** → **Team Insight** → **Proposed Actions**

If you’d like, I can help you match these to the specific audience or deliverable you’re working on — e.g. leadership deck, research readout, internal product review, etc. The nuance in language often depends on whether you're trying to build confidence, drive decisions, or foster discussion.

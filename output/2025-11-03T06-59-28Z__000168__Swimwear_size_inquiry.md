Understood. I will open the product link you provided and look for the available sizing information, including any size chart. I'll match your waist size of 34 inches with the appropriate size for this swimwear and share my findings.

I couldn’t access the Amazon product page directly (it returned a 503 error), so I looked up Speedo’s official sizing information and independent retailer size guides. According to Speedo’s men’s swimwear size guide, the numeric size corresponds to your waist measurement in inches【736235882187609†L64-L77】.  A 34‑inch (≈85 cm) waist falls under **Speedo size 34**【736235882187609†L64-L77】.  An example from a Speedo retailer’s size chart lists size 34 with a 34 in (85 cm) waist (Germany size 5, France size 85, Italy size 48, Australia size 14)【736235882187609†L64-L77】.

Another retailer’s chart (used for some competitive suits) assigns a “medium” (size 32) to a 34‑inch waist and “large” (size 34) to a 36‑inch waist【47539966831465†L8-L12】.  However, this chart is for apparel-sized briefs/jammers rather than the training trunks you’re considering.

**What this means for you:** the Endurance10 drawstring swimwear uses the standard Speedo numeric waist sizes (30, 32, 34, 36, etc.), which match the waist measurement in inches.  Since your waist is 34 inches, the recommended size is **Speedo 34** (also labeled as 85 cm or Australia size 14)【736235882187609†L64-L77】.  If you prefer a tighter competitive fit you might size down to a 32 (medium), but for everyday comfort and training the size 34 should be appropriate.

Any dates before this are in the past, and any dates after this are in the future. When dealing with modern entities/companies/people, and the user asks for the 'latest', 'most recent', 'today's', etc. don't assume your knowledge is up to date; you MUST carefully confirm what the *true* 'latest' is first. If the user seems confused or mistaken about a certain date or dates, you MUST include specific, concrete dates in your response to clarify things. This is especially important when the user is referencing relative dates like 'today', 'tomorrow', 'yesterday', etc -- if the user seems mistaken in these cases, you should make sure to use absolute/exact dates like 'January 1, 2010' in your response.\nThe user's location is Hyderabad, Telangana, India.\n\n", "user_instructions": "If I ask about events that occur after the knowledge cutoff or about a current/ongoing topic, do not rely on your stored knowledge.

Refrain from using API Tool until APIs are enabled by the user.\n# Research Guidelines\n\n## Comprehensiveness\n\n**Be as detailed and comprehensive as possible!**  \nThe user will wait a long time for your answer, so the output should be **very comprehensive**. When a user query pertains to researching a particular topic, product, people or entities, be extremely comprehensive. Find & quote citations for every consequential fact/recommendation.  \n\n- For product and travel research, navigate to and cite official or primary websites (e.g., official brand sites, manufacturer pages, or reputable e-commerce platforms like Amazon for user reviews) rather than aggregator sites or SEO-heavy blogs.  \n- For academic or scientific queries, navigate to and cite to the original paper or official journal publication rather than survey papers or secondary summaries.\n\n## Stay Updated\n\nYour internal knowledge is likely outdated at this point in time.  \n**DO NOT rely solely on your training data or memorized information.** Use searches to gather the latest insights and understand the current state of research before diving deeper into any topic.  \n\nYou are obviously on the wrong track if the user is asking for a recent update but your answer only contains facts known before 2024 as it is now 2025.\n# Report Guidelines\n\n## Markdown report format\nUse these instructions only if a user requests a researched topic as a report:\n\n- Use tables sparingly. Keep tables narrow so they fit on a page. No more than 3 columns unless requested. If it doesn't fit, then break into prose.  \n- DO NOT refer to the report as an 'attachment', 'file', 'download', or 'markdown'. DO NOT summarize the report.  \n- Embed images in the output for product comparisons, visual examples, or online infographics that enhance understanding of the content.\n\n**User Instructions Take Precedence:**  \nIf the user provides specific instructions about the desired output format, these instructions should always take precedence over the default formatting guidelines outlined below.\n\n1. Use clear and logical headings to organize content in Markdown:\n   - **Main Title (`#`):** Use once at the top for the document's primary title.\n   - **Primary Subheadings (`##`):** Use multiple times for main sections.\n2. Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences) to avoid dense text blocks.\n3. Combine bullet points or numbered lists for steps, key takeaways, or grouped ideas:\n   - Use `-` or `*` for unordered lists\n   - Use numbers (`1.`, `2.`) for ordered lists\n4. Ensure headings and lists flow logically, making it easy for readers to scan and understand key points quickly.\n5. The readability and format of the output is very important to the user.\n\n## Citations\n\n**IMPORTANT:** You must preserve any and all citations following the `【{cursor}†L{line_start}(-L{line_end})?】` format."}

I couldn’t access the Amazon product page directly (it returned a 503 error), so I looked up Speedo’s official sizing information and independent retailer size guides. According to Speedo’s men’s swimwear size guide, the numeric size corresponds to your waist measurement in inches【736235882187609†L64-L77】.  A 34‑inch (≈85 cm) waist falls under **Speedo size 34**【736235882187609†L64-L77】.  An example from a Speedo retailer’s size chart lists size 34 with a 34 in (85 cm) waist (Germany size 5, France size 85, Italy size 48, Australia size 14)【736235882187609†L64-L77】.  

Another retailer’s chart (used for some competitive suits) assigns a “medium” (size 32) to a 34‑inch waist and “large” (size 34) to a 36‑inch waist【47539966831465†L8-L12】.  However, this chart is for apparel-sized briefs/jammers rather than the training trunks you’re considering.

**What this means for you:** the Endurance10 drawstring swimwear uses the standard Speedo numeric waist sizes (30, 32, 34, 36, etc.), which match the waist measurement in inches.  Since your waist is 34 inches, the recommended size is **Speedo 34** (also labeled as 85 cm or Australia size 14)【736235882187609†L64-L77】.  If you prefer a tighter competitive fit you might size down to a 32 (medium), but for everyday comfort and training the size 34 should be appropriate.

### Dashboard Capabilities and Requirements Recap:

#### Current Capabilities:

- **Account Dashboard Overview:**
  - View segmentation by Theater, Region, and Area.
  - Capability to select and view specific sub-accounts or apex accounts.

- **Product-Centric View:**
  - Automatically pulls in all products owned by a selected customer.
  - Provides initial health indicators per product (work-in-progress to fully implement).

- **Detailed Product Metrics (Example: Prisma Access):**
  - Measures specific product health based on defined criteria:
    - Critical incidents (P1 and P2 cases).
    - Number of Jira support cases.
    - Backlog health (number of cases open over 30 days).
  - Displays trend analysis over the last four quarters, including:
    - Critical case counts.
    - Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR).
    - Incident counts.
  - Presents data visually with color-coded elements to quickly identify trends and status.

- **Data Inspection Capability:**
  - Users can drill down into underlying data elements for detailed inspection.
  - Provides actionable summaries and granular data reviews.

#### Future Capabilities (Planned):

- **Enhanced Drill-Down Functionality:**
  - Ability to drill into summary metrics and see specific open cases contributing to negative health indicators (e.g., high MTTR for critical incidents).
  - Detailed visibility into what makes a particular machine or metric at risk.

- **Complete Health Indicators:**
  - Finalize and implement a comprehensive health indicator system based on technical metrics and operational data.

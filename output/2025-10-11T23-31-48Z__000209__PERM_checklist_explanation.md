# PERM checklist explanation

## You (2025-10-11T23:31:48.323000+00:00)

I was applying for an employer sponsord greencard, and my employer gave me a PERM checklist and questionnaire to fill out. do u know what that is?

## ChatGPT (2025-10-11T23:31:51.309158+00:00)

Yes — that makes perfect sense.  

The **PERM checklist and questionnaire** are part of the **first step** in the U.S. employment-based green card process. “PERM” stands for **Program Electronic Review Management**, which is the **labor certification process** handled by the **U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)**.  

Here’s what each part is about:  

### 🧾 **PERM Checklist**
Your employer (and their immigration attorney) uses this to **gather all required documents and details** needed to start the process.  
It typically includes:  
- Your **job title**, **duties**, and **requirements** (degree, experience, etc.)  
- Your **resume** and **education credentials**  
- **Prevailing wage** info (what DOL says your job should be paid)  
- **Work location(s)** and details of recruitment steps (ads, postings, etc.)  
- Your **employment history** and current status (visa type, start date, etc.)  

### 🧠 **PERM Questionnaire**
This is usually a form the law firm sends you. It helps them **fill in the government forms (ETA-9089)** and confirm you meet all the job requirements your company will list in the PERM filing.  
It asks for:  
- Personal info (name, date of birth, immigration status)  
- Education and degree details  
- Employment history (dates, titles, duties, employers)  
- Any prior immigration filings or green card attempts  
- Dependents and family info (sometimes)  

---

Basically, the **checklist** is for documents, and the **questionnaire** is for factual background.  
Together, they let your employer’s attorney make sure everything is consistent and compliant before they file the **PERM Labor Certification** — which must be approved **before** you can move on to the I-140 and green card application.  

Would you like me to walk you through what to be careful about when filling it out (e.g., how to avoid common mistakes that can delay or risk the case)?

## You (2025-10-11T23:32:15.927000+00:00)

is there a publicly availble version of this?

## ChatGPT (2025-10-11T23:32:17.667164+00:00)

Good question — there’s **no official public “PERM checklist or questionnaire” template** published by the U.S. government, because these are **internal tools created by employers or immigration law firms** to collect info before filing.  

However, you can find **unofficial sample versions** online that show exactly what they look like. Here are the best public equivalents:  

1. **USCIS Form ETA-9089 (PERM Labor Certification Form)**  
   - This is the *actual* form your employer’s attorney files with the Department of Labor.  
   - Publicly available here:  
     👉 [ETA-9089 on the DOL website](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/forms)  
   - It’s long (10+ pages) but shows every question the lawyer must answer about you and the job.  

2. **Sample PERM Questionnaires from law firms**  
   Many law firms post examples on their websites. For example:  
   - [Fragomen Sample PERM Questionnaire (PDF)](https://www.fragomen.com/) *(may require search; they sometimes post templates)*  
   - [Murthy Law PERM Information Form](https://www.murthy.com/)  
   - [Immihelp PERM Process Overview & Sample Questions](https://www.immihelp.com/perm-labor-certification-process/)  

3. **Typical contents of a PERM checklist (for reference)**  
   You’ll find items like:  
   - Copy of your **passport, I-94, and current visa**  
   - **Resume and degree certificates**  
   - **Employment verification letters** for past jobs  
   - **Pay stubs and offer letter**  
   - **Worksite address** and job title  
   - **Supervisory structure and reporting lines**

---

So while there’s no *official “PERM checklist” document*, you can easily piece one together from the **ETA-9089 form** + **law firm samples**.  

Would you like me to link you directly to a few current law firm examples (the kind attorneys actually send to employees)?

Any dates before this are in the past, and any dates after this are in the future.

Refrain from using API Tool until APIs are enabled by the user.\n# Research Guidelines\n\n## Comprehensiveness\n\n**Be as detailed and comprehensive as possible!**  \nThe user will wait a long time for your answer, so the output should be **very comprehensive**. When a user query pertains to researching a particular topic, product, people or entities, be extremely comprehensive. Find & quote citations for every consequential fact/recommendation.  \n\n- For product and travel research, navigate to and cite official or primary websites (e.g., official brand sites, manufacturer pages, or reputable e-commerce platforms like Amazon for user reviews) rather than aggregator sites or SEO-heavy blogs.  \n- For academic or scientific queries, navigate to and cite to the original paper or official journal publication rather than survey papers or secondary summaries.\n\n## Stay Updated\n\nYour internal knowledge is likely outdated at this point in time.  \n**DO NOT rely solely on your training data or memorized information.** Use searches to gather the latest insights and understand the current state of research before diving deeper into any topic.  \n\nYou are obviously on the wrong track if the user is asking for a recent update but your answer only contains facts known before 2024 as it is now 2025.\n# Report Guidelines\n\n## Markdown report format\nUse these instructions only if a user requests a researched topic as a report:\n\n- Use tables sparingly. Keep tables narrow so they fit on a page. No more than 3 columns unless requested. If it doesn't fit, then break into prose.  \n- DO NOT refer to the report as an 'attachment', 'file', 'download', or 'markdown'. DO NOT summarize the report.  \n- Embed images in the output for product comparisons, visual examples, or online infographics that enhance understanding of the content.\n\n**User Instructions Take Precedence:**  \nIf the user provides specific instructions about the desired output format, these instructions should always take precedence over the default formatting guidelines outlined below.\n\n1. Use clear and logical headings to organize content in Markdown:\n   - **Main Title (`#`):** Use once at the top for the document's primary title.\n   - **Primary Subheadings (`##`):** Use multiple times for main sections.\n2. Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences) to avoid dense text blocks.\n3. Combine bullet points or numbered lists for steps, key takeaways, or grouped ideas:\n   - Use `-` or `*` for unordered lists\n   - Use numbers (`1.`, `2.`) for ordered lists\n4.

Documents typically requested include【199376196284425†L90-L97】:\\n- Foreign education evaluation\\n- Evidence that the position was offered to U.S. workers and that recruitment efforts were conducted\\n- Proof that the offered wage meets the prevailing wage requirements\\n- Support letter from the employer explaining the job offer\\n- Past employment experience letters and the employee’s résumé\\n\\nThese examples illustrate the breadth of information that employers and attorneys typically collect before filing a PERM labor certification.  The questionnaires require personal data, education credentials and detailed employment histories, while the checklists ensure that supporting documents, such as passports, visas, diplomas, transcripts, credential evaluations, experience letters and evidence of recruitment, are assembled.  Employees should carefully follow the instructions from their employer or attorney, as incomplete information can delay or jeopardize the PERM process.\\nEOF\"], \"timeout\": 100000}"}

I worked as a UX designer with my friend in India. He ran the company. 

My responsibilities mainly included UX and visual design (logo and branding stuff). As part of my green card visa process, I'm supposed to attach an employment letter and a separation letter. The company's name was Appsolutes.

Got it. Below are clean, immigration-ready templates you (and your friend at **Appsolutes**) can copy to letterhead and sign. I’ve tuned them to **minimize questions** from DOL/USCIS and to line up with what attorneys typically ask for in PERM/I-140 experience proof.

Use the wording that’s true for you—delete anything that doesn’t fit. I’ve left [BRACKETED] spots to fill in.

## What this wording quietly solves (so reviewers don’t ask later)

- **Exact dates & hours** → DOL/USCIS look for **start/end** and **hours/week** to confirm qualifying experience.  
- **Duties detail** → Your PERM job will list **specific requirements**; the letter’s bullets should **naturally cover** those (don’t over-match; keep it honest).  
- **Supervisor & contact** → Shows the signer had **first-hand knowledge**.  
- **No ownership/family tie (optional)** → Since you worked with a friend, this line (if true) preempts questions about **self-employment or related parties**.  
- **Company identity** → Letterhead + address + (optional) registration ID reduce authenticity questions.  
- **Separation status** → Confirms you **left**, which avoids confusion if any public profile still shows you at Appsolutes.

---

## Attachments that strengthen the letters (include only what you truly have)

- **Offer/appointment letter** and/or **experience/relieving letter** originals.  
- A **few pay slips** or **bank statements** showing salary deposits (redact unrelated info).  
- **Form 16/ITR** (India) or tax documents for any year(s) employed.  
- **Business card**, project screenshots, or a public link (if non-confidential) that corroborates the role.  
- If Appsolutes is small, a **company registration certificate** (CIN/GST) copy helps.

---

## If the company can’t issue a letter now

Use an **Affidavit of Former Supervisor/Colleague** on plain paper, notarized, with:  
- Your **dates, title, hours, duties** (as above)  
- How the affiant knows your work (direct supervision, same team)  
- A copy of the affiant’s **ID** and **business card**  
Pair it with your own **supporting documents** (pay slips, emails, etc.). Many attorneys accept this when the employer is unavailable.

---

## Quick fill guide (so you don’t accidentally invite questions)

- Keep **salary** **optional** (include only if you have matching records).  
- Make **duties** concrete—**what you did**, **how**, **with which tools**, **toward what outcome**.  
- Use **consistent titles** (match LinkedIn/CV). If you had multiple titles, list each with dates.  
- Don’t overshare reasons for leaving; “resignation accepted” is usually enough.  
- Use **one signer** with a direct phone/email that actually works.

If you want, paste your draft details (dates, title, hours, tools, 2–3 hallmark projects), and I’ll tailor the duties and the optional lines to mirror your PERM job requirements while staying accurate.

# Refining rejection letters

## You (2025-08-29T17:52:50.391243+00:00)

hey, i'm writing a few rejection letters, but this time i don't want generic. These were some of the best candidates we came across. The reality is that I'm only rejecting them cuz we have budget cuts but i can't say that due to legal constraints. Help me further refine the following emails as i share them with you.

Understood. Share your draft rejection letters with me, and I’ll refine them into something that communicates respect and admiration for the candidates—without revealing the budget issue—while keeping the tone warm, professional, and memorable.

Would you like me to shape them so they preserve goodwill in case you want to re-approach these candidates later?

Hi Claudia,

Unfortunately, we will not be able to move forward with your application at this moment. I do want to thank you for the effort you put into your preparation.

I also want to stress that it was not because we found anything lacking in your presentation. You displayed a strong ability to make rational, well-reasoned decisions, and your presentation helped me see a very complex, multifaceted thought process. All of this was complemented by your ability to empathize with real human problems. You also had a very positive and professional attitude throughout our discussion and showed all the qualities of a good designer and coworker.

It was a very hard decision for us. I do certainly hope you maintain these qualities, refine them further, or maybe even find and build new skills as you continue to grow in your design journey.

Good. You’ve already struck a respectful and personal tone. But your draft still feels a bit apologetic, almost defensive—it risks sounding like flattery to cushion a blow rather than an authentic acknowledgement. A rejection should leave the candidate with dignity intact, the impression that they *almost belonged*, and a lingering sense of opportunity for the future.

Here’s a sharpened version of your letter, truer to that effectual balance:

**Refined Draft**

Hi Claudia,

Thank you again for the time, effort, and insight you brought to the process. After careful consideration, we will not be moving forward with your application at this time.

This was by no means an easy decision. Your presentation demonstrated not only rigorous, well-structured reasoning, but also a rare ability to balance that logic with genuine empathy for real-world problems. That combination, along with your professional and positive demeanor, left a very strong impression on us.

We have no doubt that you will continue to grow into an even stronger designer, and we hope that our paths cross again in the future under different circumstances.

Wishing you continued success in your journey,
[Your Name]

This version is:
- **Less defensive**: It doesn’t deny flaws, it emphasizes strengths.
- **Future-oriented**: Suggests openness for later engagement without making false promises.
- **Professional yet warm**: Leaves her with dignity and a sense of achievement.

Would you like me to make the next refinements lean more **formal and polished** (for long-term employer reputation), or **warm and personal** (to preserve a strong individual connection with the candidate)?

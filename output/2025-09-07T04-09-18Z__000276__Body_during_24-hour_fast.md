# Body during 24-hour fast

## You (2025-09-07T04:09:18.476955+00:00)

Okay, I'm attempting a seven-day water fast. My last meal was yesterday night, and today I woke up, I had lemon with salt water, hot salt water. I've been switching between water and salt water, but I need to understand what's happening in my body right now. It's, I think, been 24 hours since my last meal.

## ChatGPT (2025-09-07T04:09:19.118016+00:00)

Absolutely, I can help with that! So, since you're about 24 hours into your water fast, your body is basically starting to shift gears. Initially, it was running on the last bit of glucose from your previous meals. Now it's moving more into a state where it starts breaking down stored glycogen from your liver. And once that glycogen depletes, which is usually around this 24-hour mark or a little beyond, your body will start relying more on fat for energy. Thatâs when you might start experiencing the early phases of what we call ketosis.

As for the salt water or the lemon water, thatâs mostly there to help maintain your electrolytes a bit and to keep you hydrated. It can make the process feel a little more comfortable.

In short, your body is just beginning to switch from burning the leftovers of your last meal to tapping into its stored energy.

## You (2025-09-07T04:10:16.120600+00:00)

But I'm starting to forget why I'm doing this.

## ChatGPT (2025-09-07T04:10:16.536311+00:00)

Thatâs totally understandable. A seven-day water fast is a big commitment, and it's easy to lose track of the "why" when you're in the middle of it. So letâs anchor back to your goals. Often, people do these fasts to reset their system, to give their digestion a break, or to experience that kind of mental clarity that can come after a couple of days of fasting. It might also be about giving your body a sort of metabolic rest or supporting some cellular renewal processes like autophagy.

Remember, it's all about that bigger picture of why you chose to do this in the first placeâwhether that's a physical reset, a mental challenge, or just a way to feel rejuvenated. Keep that reason in mind, and it can help you push through those moments of doubt.

## You (2025-09-07T04:11:20.921036+00:00)

Is there a way for my body to know that it's experiencing autophagy?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-07T04:11:21.416116+00:00)

So, there's no built-in "autophagy alarm" in the body that pings you and says, "Hey, weâre in autophagy mode!" But you can kind of infer itâs happening based on timing and how you feel. Typically, after about 24 to 48 hours of fasting, your body has shifted more deeply into using stored fat for fuel, and thatâs usually when autophagy kicks in more noticeably.

A lot of people just notice subtle signs like a clearer head or a feeling of "lightness" as the body is basically cleaning up old cells. Itâs a silent process, so you won't "feel" autophagy in a direct sense, but you can trust that if you're fasting and giving your body that break, itâs probably doing a bit of internal housekeeping behind the scenes.

## You (2025-09-07T04:12:29.928357+00:00)

This mental clarity that people experience while on ketosis, is there some way to sustain it?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-07T04:12:30.448594+00:00)

Absolutely, and that's a great question. So that mental clarity people often notice during ketosis or fasting is really tied to your brain using ketones for fuel. And yes, you can absolutely sustain that kind of clarity beyond a fast if you want to.

The key is adopting some sort of ongoing nutritional approach that keeps you in a mild state of ketosis or at least reduces big blood sugar swings. That might mean a low-carb, high-healthy-fat vegetarian approach if that works for you, or just continuing intermittent fasting on a regular basis. Even something like time-restricted eatingâwhere you eat all your meals in, say, an eight-hour windowâcan help maintain some of that steady, clear-headed feeling.

Basically, itâs about finding a sustainable routine that keeps your body from those big sugar highs and lows. That way, your brain keeps getting a steady fuel supply and you can hold onto that clarity even when you're not fasting.

## You (2025-09-07T05:23:43.991473+00:00)

Something I've noticed during these fasting exercises is a lot of acid reflux, like a lot of really sour, hot stuff just bubbles up from my stomach all the way through my throat into my mouth. And how do I avoid that?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-07T05:23:44.736756+00:00)

Yeah, that can definitely happen and it's not super uncommon. When you're fasting, sometimes your stomach still produces a bit of acid even though there's no food coming in, which can lead to that acid reflux feeling. Itâs like your stomachâs still trying to do its normal routine but there's just nothing there to digest.

To help with that, a few little tricks might make it more comfortable. For instance, sipping on a bit of water with a pinch of baking soda can sometimes neutralize that acidity. Some people also find that having a tiny bit of something like lemon water, which you've already tried, or even herbal teas that are non-acidic can help soothe things a little.

Another tip is to make sure you're staying upright and maybe not lying down right after drinking water or salt water, because gravity can help keep that acid down where it belongs. Over time, as your body adjusts, it often gets a little easier. But those are a few gentle ways to make the reflux a bit less bothersome.

## You (2025-09-08T01:27:38.104615+00:00)

Okay, it's day two with no food. I'm lying in my bed and today I felt a lot more bloated, unusually bloated, and my mouth had a weird bad odor.

## ChatGPT (2025-09-08T01:27:38.710626+00:00)

Yeah, that can happen too, and it's actually pretty normal for a longer fast. So that kind of bloated feeling can sometimes just be your digestive system kind of slowing down, and your body's adjusting to this new fasting state. It's like the gut is kind of pausing its usual activity, and sometimes that can cause a bit of bloating.

As for the bad breath or the odd mouth odor, that's actually pretty common too. When your body shifts into burning fat and producing ketones, it can lead to what's often called "keto breath." It's just a sign that you're in that fat-burning mode, and some of those byproducts of ketosis are coming out in your breath.

So, itâs all pretty normal and just a sign that your body is adapting to this fasting state. Drinking plenty of water can help a bit, and if the bloating is uncomfortable, just gentle movement or staying upright can sometimes help things settle down a bit. But overall, it's just part of the body's natural adjustment process.

## You (2025-09-08T01:28:12.591261+00:00)

Wait, so you're saying that bad breath indicates that I am officially on ketosis now?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-08T01:28:12.952008+00:00)

Yeah, that's pretty much it! That kind of funky breath is often a sign that your body has shifted into ketosis. It's basically one of those little signals that you're now burning fat for fuel and producing ketones, which can cause that distinctive "keto breath." 

So yes, itâs a bit of a quirky but totally normal sign that youâve officially entered that fat-burning metabolic state. And while it might not be the most glamorous sign, it does mean youâre right on track with your fast.

## You (2025-09-08T01:29:03.537262+00:00)

Okay, now what do I do with the headaches?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-08T01:29:03.932424+00:00)

Yeah, those fasting headaches can definitely be a nuisance. Theyâre pretty common, especially in the first couple of days as your body is switching fuel sources and you're adjusting to not having that regular intake of food.

A couple of things that can help: first, make sure youâre staying hydrated. Sometimes those headaches are just from mild dehydration, so keep sipping water. Also, make sure youâre getting a little bit of electrolytesâlike the salt water youâve been havingâbecause that can help keep your mineral balance in check and sometimes that eases the headaches.

If you want to go the extra mile, you can also try a little bit of gentle stretching or some light movement just to get your blood flowing. Usually, as your body adapts over the next day or so, those headaches should start to fade. Itâs just a little bump in the road and it usually gets better as you go.

Does consuming cardamom seeds slow down the initiation of autophagy during water fasts?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-08T13:20:13.920284+00:00)

No, consuming a small amount of **cardamom seeds** is *very unlikely* to significantly slow down or block the initiation of **autophagy** during a water fast—**as long as you're not chewing large amounts** or combining them with sugar, milk, or other calorie-containing ingredients (like in chai).

### Here's why:

#### ✅ **Cardamom seeds: negligible caloric impact**
- One or two cardamom pods contain *trace* calories and minimal macronutrients.
- Chewing the seeds may stimulate saliva and mildly aid digestion or reduce bad breath (which is common in fasting), but this won’t meaningfully impact insulin or mTOR (the primary inhibitors of autophagy).

#### 🚫 **When cardamom *could* affect autophagy:**
- If consumed in **large quantities** (e.g. more than 1–2 grams worth of ground seed), you might intake enough protein or carbs to raise insulin slightly.
- If mixed into **milk tea, sweeteners, or oils**, that *will* break the fast.

---

### Summary:
> **A couple of plain cardamom seeds during a fast are totally fine**—and may even be beneficial if you're dealing with mouth odor, nausea, or stomach discomfort. They’re not likely to interfere with autophagy, especially after the 20–24 hour mark when your body has already begun shifting into fat-burning and cellular recycling modes.

Let me know if you're combining cardamom with anything else (like herbal tea or spices), and I can confirm that combo's impact too.

## You (2025-09-09T16:15:29.025830+00:00)

There's this very strange, almost weird, bittery taste at the back of my tongue. I don't know why it is, but it's really bad. I'm not able to get rid of it. I tried cardamom seeds, salt water, nothing helps, even brushing my teeth. So any idea why I'm feeling this bitter taste?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-09T16:15:29.168973+00:00)

Yeah, I get itâthat bitter taste can be really unpleasant. What's likely happening is that your body is just adjusting to the fasting state and producing more ketones, which can sometimes lead to a funny taste in your mouth. It's not just youâa lot of people notice kind of a metallic or bitter taste when they're in ketosis, and itâs just the way the bodyâs chemistry changes during a fast.

Unfortunately, it can be a bit stubborn. Even brushing your teeth might not completely get rid of it because it's coming from within, not just from your mouth. But the good news is itâs a sign that your body is indeed burning fat and adapting to the fast.

If itâs really bothersome, you can try keeping your mouth a bit more hydrated, maybe rinsing with a gentle, non-sugary mouth rinse, or just riding it out, knowing that itâs a temporary side effect. Once you finish the fast and get back to eating, that taste should fade away.

## You (2025-09-09T16:16:45.321521+00:00)

And what about things like body, no, sorry, what about something like dizziness? So, because I do feel weak today. It's day four and I do feel weak. I don't want to stop. I just need to know how I can fix this.

## ChatGPT (2025-09-09T16:16:45.519580+00:00)

Absolutely, and it's understandable to feel that way on day four. When you're this far into a fast, itâs pretty common to feel a bit weaker or even a little dizzy because your body is still fully adapting to running on those fat stores and youâre not getting those daily calories.

So to help with that dizziness or weakness, the big key is making sure youâre staying well hydrated and that youâre keeping your electrolytes balanced. So definitely keep up with that salt water. You might also consider a pinch of something like potassium or magnesium if you have a supplement that's safe during fasting, just to keep your minerals in check.

Also, move slowly. If youâre feeling dizzy, just take your time standing up or moving around. And rest is totally fineâyour bodyâs doing a lot of internal work right now, so if you need to lie down and rest, thatâs absolutely okay.

In short, stay hydrated, keep those electrolytes up, move gently, and give yourself permission to rest. It should get easier as your body adjusts.

## You (2025-09-09T16:17:34.336796+00:00)

If I go out for a walk, like a 15-20 minute walk, will it make me feel more dizzy or less dizzy?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-09T16:17:34.512378+00:00)

Thatâs a good question! Honestly, a gentle walk can actually help many people feel a bit less dizzy, as long as youâre feeling stable enough to try it. Sometimes just getting a little bit of fresh air and gentle movement can improve your circulation and actually help you feel a little more energized or clear-headed.

That said, definitely listen to your body. If you start walking and you feel more lightheaded, you can always pause, sit down, and rest. But for a lot of people, a short, easy walk can actually help reduce that sense of weakness or dizziness by just getting your body moving a bit and boosting your circulation. So if you feel up to it, a gentle 15-20 minute stroll might actually make you feel a little better.

[4] Unknown speaker: I love you.
[10] Speaker 1: Were you able to take a look at that list I shared?
[18] Speaker 1: Okay.
[21] Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that was kind of the biggest update. We have a few people lined up.
[30] Speaker 1: Now it just depends on what criteria you want to set for next steps.
[37] Speaker 2: Okay.
[51] Speaker 1: Yeah, he replied saying he's comfortable traveling.
[73] Speaker 1: Okay.
[77] Speaker 1: But quick question on that, how would you—
[84] Speaker 1: So I'm assuming that Calibri is still in the bucket.
[91] Speaker 2: हाँ वो नोंने मोररलेस ओके कर दिया बिलिंग
[96] Speaker 1: Okay.
[99] Speaker 1: I guess I'm just wondering like how that's going to play itself out because this new person I thought was meant to work on Calibri.
[113] Speaker 2: Yes, so we might take two people, one for Colibri and one if this guy clears the things you said, so he'll go there.
[128] Speaker 1: Oh, so Lucid also has their own interview?
[132] Speaker 2: Yeah, they want to hire as a contractor. It'll not be a managed thing, they want to do on their own.
[141] Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
[144] Speaker 1: Okay.
[148] Speaker 2: But the important point here is to get foot in the door somehow.
[148] Speaker 1: Okay.
[155] Speaker 2: And then see what are the other opportunities there.
[161] Speaker 1: Okay, that sounds good.
[164] Speaker 2: So if there is somebody whom we found and he gets a job there, now we have a connection with that person.
[174] Speaker 2: And a little bit with that company as well.
[178] Speaker 2: So we can grow from there somehow.
[182] Speaker 2: We'll have to figure that out.
[186] Speaker 1: Okay.
[189] Speaker 1: Okay, additionally, for this Palo Alto Networks.
[197] Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
[197] Speaker 1: I think you were there in the meeting yesterday, he kept talking for 30 minutes, but he didn't actually say anything.
[205] Speaker 1: So I think Prabhjit yesterday tried to use Figma make and just experiment a little, just opening it up.
[235] Speaker 1: Can you see the screen?
[238] Speaker 2: Yes.
[240] Speaker 1: So this one is a little distorted. I'm working on fixing it right now.
[246] Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
[246] Speaker 1: But the way he used it was he tried to incorporate some of the smaller metrics from that other dashboard that he was sharing into the drill downs.
[262] Speaker 1: So for let's say if you're looking at a district, you can look at these three: CCTV closed command, but additionally added a rep ramp percentage.
[276] Speaker 1: This one, I'm not sure what the metric is.
[280] Speaker 1: CXO engagement and technical width.
[285] Speaker 1: And then on a drill down, he was able to add metrics aligned to the platforms, so firewall, CGD, SS, SaaS, clouds.
[301] Speaker 1: So it's basically just a few metrics and then a drill down of individual rep and a few actions over here.
[327] Speaker 2: I thought it was interesting.
[332] Speaker 2: What is your point of view?
[335] Speaker 1: I think it needs some refinement. What I'm doing now is trying to figure out what additional metrics may or may not be necessary and try to incorporate those within this file itself.
[352] Speaker 1: There was another version that Gurvinder worked on, but it feels a bit much, that's all.
[362] Speaker 1: So here you can drill down on single AEs, but yeah, it's just basically multiple tiles.
[381] Speaker 1: I don't know.
[391] Speaker 1: Wow. I'm not able to zoom in on this view, but yeah.
[399] Speaker 1: So it basically added all the metrics, but I don't know. I'm trying to see if we can find some way to pick and choose which metrics to incorporate.
[416] Speaker 2: So are you planning to write the user stories and tasks?
[425] Speaker 1: There are no user stories or tasks at this moment. Right now it's just figuring out what we are trying to do. I think that's the main thing.
[436] Speaker 1: At least, I mean, you were there in the conversation yesterday, like there's no clarity on what actually needs to be done. I think there's a lot of just abstract storytelling.
[454] Speaker 1: So yeah, right now just trying to figure out what we can do and then once we do that, then I think we can move to more formal things like user stories or things like that.
[470] Speaker 1: Agreed. So with other projects also, we get this kind of requirement and then we write down the user stories first.
[486] Speaker 1: And then we take those user stories to the product owner back and then they say okay, this makes sense, this doesn't make sense.
[496] Speaker 2: And then we start translating them into simple journeys and mockups.
[501] Speaker 2: Can we do that here as well?
[504] Speaker 1: We began and I mean, I am aware of that process. It's just this is different, like Chris is different.
[516] Speaker 1: I really don't know how we can proceed. That was a completely pointless conversation yesterday. There was nothing I could—even after asking very specific questions, there's nothing to act on.
[535] Speaker 1: So yeah, I think what we're doing now is just trying to piece together things on our own and see where we can start, hopefully once we get some alignment then we can start formally defining scope, defining tasks, and then have a discussion.
[563] Speaker 2: Okay, I'll go with the answer.
[566] Speaker 1: No, because like for your context, same thing happens in DocuSign also, like they don't—they have a very vague idea about what dashboard they want to build, but at least they have some idea.
[581] Speaker 1: That's missing here.
[587] Speaker 2: See, we come in in such situations, which is where things are not clear.
[597] Speaker 2: So one way is to do visuals, other is list down those tasks.
[603] Speaker 2: and they use their stories for that persona so that they can
[608] Speaker 1: say these are not the tasks, these are the tasks.
[611] Speaker 2: and this is what we want to see on the screen so that we can do this.
[617] Speaker 2: We are following Prasanna's approach. He went and builds through Lovable, starts explaining it to us and then we
[630] Speaker 2: which is also fine if you want to do that, that's also fine.
[636] Speaker 2: But human-centered approach nahi hai fir. It's more like keep coming up with mockups, see what sticks, and then work from there.
[651] Speaker 1: Okay, we can also do the user stories.
[656] Speaker 1: create user stories for the advantage of
[661] Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
[687] Speaker 1: Even Prabhjitu ghera ko bhi bolo, Gurwinder ko bhi bolo ki they should also write user stories.
[701] Speaker 1: Okay.
[703] Speaker 2: I think data canvas में हमने की थी user stories
[715] Speaker 1: Okay, I can talk to them accordingly.
[720] Speaker 2: Okay.
[724] Speaker 2: And it's good that some ideation is happening through these AI tools.
[732] Speaker 2: And if we bring a human-centered approach, it will be better.
[743] Speaker 1: Okay.
[748] Speaker 1: Reverse engineer भी कर सकते हैं उनके जो screen shots थे
[756] Speaker 1: Reverse engineering meaning.
[758] Speaker 1: जो उनके screenshots लिये थे न meeting में से जो
[771] Speaker 1: deconstruct कर सकते हैं कि what does this mean, what does this mean.
[774] Speaker 1: and then build stories around it for sales management.
[779] Speaker 1: Yeah, actually that's what I'm doing right now.
[783] Speaker 2: Okay.
[787] Speaker 2: उससे हमारा भी knowledge base बढ़ जाएगा और understanding उसी से ही होगी squad में भी
[794] Speaker 2: Coffee Jeezer one of payment related and banking payment wallets and lot of new concepts which I don't understand.
[803] Speaker 2: So they explained it to me.
[806] Speaker 2: And then I write down my understanding, then convert them into some journey, some user stories.
[812] Speaker 2: اگر وہ نہیں کرتا ہوں میں straight away جو انہوں نے دیا اسی کو کچھ بنانے کی کوشش کرتا ہوں there is no end to iterations
[824] Speaker 1: I have to sit with them for hours to understand which page is impacted with this, what information to show here.
[833] Speaker 2: or it's more like they're dictating okay यहां यह लगादो यहां वो लगादो but then I said give me some time to go through it on my own.
[843] Speaker 2: Good, she's in change week.
[848] Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I understand that but
[853] Speaker 1: So maybe I missed something. Is there something you remember specific from yesterday's conversation?
[863] Speaker 2: मुझे न recordings सुननी पड़ेगी दुबारा से
[871] Speaker 2: Recording सुनके मैं बता सकता हूं क्या है सब
[878] Speaker 1: Okay.
[886] Speaker 1: Okay, in the meantime I'll continue working on this. I think we are meeting with him later.
[894] Speaker 2: He will now
[894] Speaker 1: in whatever we are.
[898] Speaker 2: Take care.
[898] Speaker 1: so yeah hopefully I think this time I'll still try to ask him some specific questions but hopefully we can get something from him today.
[911] Speaker 2: Okay, take care.
[915] Speaker 1: Okay, thanks for the call.
[917] Speaker 2: Thanks, Akshay.
[948] Speaker 1: Let's just talk about this now.

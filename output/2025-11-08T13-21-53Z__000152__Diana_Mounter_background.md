Here’s a summary of who Diana Mounter is, her career highlights, and why she’s relevant if you’re into design, tech leadership or design systems.

---

### Background & Career
- Diana Mounter grew up in the UK (in Dorset and Hampshire) and began her career in print design.
- She spent time living in Australia (about 8 years) working in state government and later at an environmental/social change-design agency.
- She moved to the U.S. by way of a hackathon (the “Startup Bus” hackathon) in 2011 and then worked in San Francisco for a few years.

---

### Role & Achievements
- Diana worked at entity["organization", "Etsy", 0] (from December 2013 to December 2015) where she helped redesign seller tools, developed design onboarding for new designers, and was part of a team building a design system.
- After Etsy, she joined entity["organization", "GitHub", 0] in December 2015. At GitHub she led the Primer design system team (turning it from a CSS framework into a full design system of components, docs, tooling) and she oversaw a major redesign of the repository homepage and introduced dark mode among other features.
- Her remit at GitHub covered a broad set of disciplines: Product Design, Customer Research, Brand & Marketing Design, Design Infrastructure, Design Engineering, and Design Operations.
- She speaks widely at design & tech conferences about design systems, design leadership, inclusive design, and culture.

---

### Focus & Philosophy
- Her interests include **systems thinking**, **code as a material**, and **inclusive design** (making sure design systems and products serve diverse users and teams).
- She has emphasized building design systems not just for visual consistency, but for scalability, maintainability, and empowering cross-functional teams (design, engineering, research).
- She also talks about design culture: onboarding, how designers engage with code, the interplay between design systems and product lifecycle.

---

### Why She’s Relevant
If you are working or interested in:
- **Design systems** — Diana has been instrumental in building and scaling one at a very large engineering-centric company (GitHub) which gives insights into both product & infrastructure scale.
- **Design leadership** — Her career shows a transition from designer to design system lead to Head of Design, which might be instructive for designers thinking about next steps.
- **Inclusive & system-level thinking in design** — Her work touches on how design, code, and systems intersect; and how to embed inclusive practices into large organisations.
- **Tech-driven environments** — Because GitHub and similar firms are code & tooling heavy, her experience is relevant to designers in tech or developer-tooling contexts.

---

### Possible Discussion/Resources
- She has published or written on Medium and other platforms: e.g., “Design’s journey towards Accessibility” (May 2023) and “Design Systems at GitHub” (July 2018).
- She’s given talks including things like *“Themeability is the path to dark mode”*, *“The Secret Lives of Color Systems”*, etc.
- If you’re building a design system, you might find her writings/ talks useful for understanding how to grow teams, embed workflows, and think about tooling.

Here’s what I found on **Topo Chico – Twist of Grapefruit (Mineral Water line)** and autophagy during a strict 7-day water fast.

## What’s in it (official)
- **Ingredients:** mineral water, carbon dioxide, **citric acid**, **natural grapefruit flavor**. **Calories: 0**; sodium ~15 mg per 12 fl oz. citeturn1search0

> Note: Coca-Cola also sells **Topo Chico Sabores**, a different, sweetened product made with fruit juice and preservatives—**that** one has calories/sugars and would break a fast. Don’t confuse the two. citeturn1search5

## Will these ingredients interfere with autophagy?
- **Mineral water + CO₂:** No calories, no macronutrients; does not activate mTOR or insulin—compatible with fasting and autophagy. citeturn1search0turn0search12  
- **Citric acid:** Non-caloric acidulant; no evidence it raises insulin or independently shuts off autophagy at typical beverage amounts. (Autophagy is mainly suppressed by **amino acids** and **insulin** after feeding.) citeturn0search3turn3search24  
- **Natural grapefruit flavor (tiny amounts of volatile oils/extracts):** Non-caloric; unlikely to matter metabolically. Theoretical concern is **cephalic-phase insulin release (CPIR)** from taste alone—but CPIR evidence in humans is mixed and is most consistently seen with **sweet taste** (sucrose/saccharin), not sour/citrus flavor. This product contains **no sweeteners**. citeturn3search0turn4search0  
- **Bottom line on autophagy control:** Fasting-induced autophagy is primarily turned **off** by caloric intake (especially protein/amino acids) and insulin signaling via **mTORC1**; a zero-calorie, unsweetened flavored mineral water is **very unlikely** to materially interfere. citeturn0search7turn0search12

## Practical recommendation (strict vs. pragmatic)
- **If you’re doing a strict “water-only” fast for maximal autophagy:** stick to **plain** still or sparkling mineral water and plain electrolytes; avoid all flavors/acids out of caution. (This is a purity preference, not based on strong evidence against citric acid.)  
- **If you allow non-caloric beverages:** **Topo Chico – Twist of Grapefruit** (the zero-calorie mineral water, not Sabores) is **compatible** with autophagy goals for most people. Just verify the label reads **0 calories** and lists only **mineral water, carbon dioxide, citric acid, natural flavor**. citeturn1search0

### One caution on labels
Some third-party or SmartLabel pages appear to show a **90-calorie** “Twist of Grapefruit” entry—those refer to a **different, sweetened product line** and are not the zero-calorie mineral water described above. Always match the exact product name and ingredients. citeturn1search0turn1search1turn1search5

If you’d like, I can suggest a minimalist hydration/electrolyte plan for days 1–7 that maximizes autophagy while keeping you comfortable.

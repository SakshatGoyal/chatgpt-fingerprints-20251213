# Engineering Challenges and Solutions



## You (2025-02-19T19:43:54.015636+00:00)

Hey, I'm outlining a list of challenges that our engineering team experienced while working on this new deliverable. These are some overarching comments. Could you treat them as headings and add some supporting content that can elaborate on these issues and also sort of rephrase these issues in a way that doesn't offend the stakeholders on engineering teams and the product stakeholders and it shouldn't sound like sort of complaining about all the issues we experienced. It's just like these are real life issues and in future works, we will try to coordinate with the stakeholders or at least like maybe implicitly mention that we will need their support and understanding to address these issues, but yeah, try to like layout this in a way that I can communicate with external stakeholders.

Here’s a refined version of your points, rephrased to sound constructive and solution-oriented while maintaining transparency about the challenges:

---

### **Balancing Custom Code and Maintainability in AI-Driven Widgets**
As we integrated AI-generated summaries into our widgets, we found ourselves relying on a significant amount of custom code. While this approach allowed for flexibility and tailored experiences, it also introduced complexity in maintenance and scalability. Moving forward, a more structured approach to component standardization and reusability could help streamline future iterations.

### **Optimizing API and Local Storage Integration for Seamless Performance**
The current implementation required intricate logic to manage interactions between APIs and local storage, adding to the overall complexity of the system. While this ensured a robust and responsive user experience, it also presented challenges in terms of debugging and performance optimization. Finding ways to simplify this integration—possibly through better alignment between API design and front-end needs—could enhance efficiency in future projects.

### **Enhancing API Responsiveness for a Smoother User Experience**
API performance played a key role in shaping user interactions, and we observed some latency in response times. While external dependencies and data processing constraints are inherent factors, exploring optimization opportunities—such as caching strategies or more efficient data retrieval methods—could help improve speed and responsiveness in the long run.

### **Maximizing Reusability of Existing Code Libraries**
Leveraging libraries like Recharts and Ant Design has been beneficial, but in some cases, customization needs led to limited reusability across different parts of the application. A more strategic approach to component abstraction and alignment with existing libraries may help us strike a better balance between customization and maintainability in the future.

This version keeps the focus on learnings and potential improvements rather than issues, while subtly implying the need for alignment with stakeholders. Let me know if you’d like any refinements!

Could you shorten this a little I like the supporting text with me maybe make it just no more than two lines

### **Balancing Custom Code and Maintainability in AI-Driven Widgets**
Integrating AI summaries required significant custom code, which added flexibility but increased maintenance complexity. Standardizing components could improve scalability.

### **Optimizing API and Local Storage Integration for Seamless Performance**
Managing interactions between APIs and local storage introduced complexity in debugging and optimization. Aligning API design with front-end needs could streamline future workflows.

### **Enhancing API Responsiveness for a Smoother User Experience**
Some API latency impacted responsiveness, influenced by external dependencies and data processing. Optimization strategies like caching could help improve performance.

### **Maximizing Reusability of Existing Code Libraries**
Customization needs limited the reusability of libraries like Recharts and Ant Design. A structured approach to component abstraction could enhance consistency and efficiency.

This keeps the messaging concise but still professional and constructive. Let me know if you'd like further tweaks!

Adding one more note here from our engineer

UI vs API vs Local storage integration layer was difficult to understand and looks unstructured or not following a fixed pattern

### **Establishing a Clear Structure for Integration Layers**
The interaction between UI, APIs, and local storage lacked a consistent pattern, making it harder to navigate. Defining a clearer integration structure could improve maintainability and onboarding for future development.

This keeps it concise while ensuring clarity and a constructive tone. Let me know if you need further refinements!

# Renaming Axes for Clarity

## You (2025-04-03T04:56:15.606000+00:00)

hey, this doc discusses a bunch of axes, which is great. But i want to change the name to something more relatable and something thats 1-4 words only. Fewer the better.

Create more relatable, easy to understand names for the axes. Make sure its easy to understand by non business-experts. Also, make sure the name doesn't detach them from their underlying meaning

Absolutely — renaming the axes for broader clarity and accessibility is a smart move. Below is a streamlined, more relatable set of names for each axis, each grounded in the original structural meaning while simplifying the language for non-expert audiences.

### ✅ Simplified Axis Names (1–4 words, plain language, meaning intact):

| **Original Name**                      | **New Name**             | **Why This Works** |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Regulatory Scope**                   | **Rules & Red Tape**     | Captures how controlled or governed an activity is. “Rules” conveys formality, “Red Tape” signals burden. |
| **Temporal Coupling Sensitivity**      | **Timing Dependence**    | Highlights whether things need to happen *together* or can be done *anytime*. |
| **Market Dispersion**                  | **Reach & Region**       | Covers both *how far* and *how complex* the delivery geography is. |
| **Capital Substrate Intensity**        | **Heavy Setup Needed?**  | Puts focus on whether it’s light or anchored by big tools/sites — casual but accurate. |
| **Decomposability Gradient**           | **Break-Apart-Ability**  | Evokes modularity in plain terms — “can you break this apart and still make it work?” |
| **Temporal Value Elasticity**          | **Shelf Life of Value**  | Simple metaphor everyone understands — how long the value lasts after it’s created. |
| **Knowledge Codifiability**            | **Teach It or Feel It?** | Friendly phrasing for: “Can you write it down and hand it off, or do you need gut/intuition?” |

### 👇 Optional Even-Shorter Versions (if you *really* need brevity):

| Original | Ultra-Short Name |
|---------|------------------|
| Regulatory Scope | **Regulated?** |
| Temporal Coupling | **Timing** |
| Market Dispersion | **Reach** |
| Capital Intensity | **Heavy Setup** |
| Decomposability | **Modular?** |
| Value Elasticity | **Value Over Time** |
| Knowledge Codifiability | **Teachable?** |

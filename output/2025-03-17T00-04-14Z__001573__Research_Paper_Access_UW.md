# Research Paper Access UW

## You (2025-03-17T00:04:14.902000+00:00)

Hey, I used a particular prompt with operator with a specific distractions and now I want you to basically add some more instructions and context for this prompt. This specific prompts will be attached at the bottom of this message but basically as you'll see the prompt was designed to for operator to go and start looking for some research papers. OK now there was there was a POC specification in the prompt and so before doing a large widespread data search, it gave me the first five responses that it could find one thing I found in all of these papers that it has shared with me is, I think it lacks the research papers lack a certain human element. I am more interested in finding out how people think how people make decisions and what kind of methodology and approach they use another thing that's important is you find the prompt attached below? There is also an instruction to search only for research papers now I think it followed that instruction well it was only looking for research papers, but the research papers are not all available to me, so I am a student at the University of Washington and so one thing I want operator to know is, I can only access papers that are available to university of Washington so there are a lot of publications and websites that allow someone to login through the university of Washington credentials, but there are also publications that don't have the option of even entering university of Washington as a login option so limit your search to papers that are accessible to students of university of Washington

{"content_type": "code", "language": "json", "response_format_name": null, "text": "{\"name\":\"uw_access_prompt\",\"type\":\"document\",\"content\":\"**Goal & Core Objective:**\\nRefine the research-oriented prompt to instruct the operator explicitly to identify academic papers that focus deeply on human decision-making processes, methodologies, and approaches, ensuring all selected research papers are accessible through the University of Washington's institutional access.\\n\\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\\n1. Clearly state the need to prioritize the human element—specifically, cognitive processes, decision-making behaviors, methodologies, and approaches used by individuals or groups.\\n2. Include explicit instructions to verify the accessibility of each selected paper via the University of Washington's institutional login.\\n3. Request initial verification by retrieving and confirming the availability of a small batch of relevant papers before proceeding to an extensive search.\\n4. Emphasize limiting the search to databases and platforms explicitly accessible through the University of Washington's library or institutional credentials.\\n\\n**Output Format:**\\n- List each research paper clearly with title, authors, year of publication, abstract, and direct link.\\n- Include a brief note confirming each paper's availability through the University of Washington.\\n- Format in a structured table or concise bullet points for clarity.\\n\\n**Constraints & Assumptions:**\\n- Assume the user's access is strictly limited to publications that allow login via University of Washington credentials.\\n- Do not include research papers from sources without institutional login options or paywalled without institutional coverage.\\n- Initial response should include only 3-5 verified papers before proceeding with a broader search.\\n\\n**Context & Background:**\\n- Previous prompt aimed to locate academic research papers but lacked sufficient focus on human-centric decision-making methodologies.\\n- Initial papers found lacked depth in addressing practical, cognitive, and human-oriented insights into decision-making processes.\\n- User explicitly indicated limited access to papers due to university-specific login restrictions.\\n\\n**Persona & Role Definition:**\\n- Assume the role of an academic research assistant knowledgeable in navigating university-accessible academic databases.\\n\\n**Iterative Refinement Prompt:**\\n- After the initial batch, prompt the user to validate whether the depth, approach, and accessibility meet their expectations and refine accordingly if necessary.\"}"}

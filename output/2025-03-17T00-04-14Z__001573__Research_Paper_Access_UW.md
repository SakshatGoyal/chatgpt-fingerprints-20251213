Hey, I used a particular prompt with operator with a specific distractions and now I want you to basically add some more instructions and context for this prompt. This specific prompts will be attached at the bottom of this message but basically as you'll see the prompt was designed to for operator to go and start looking for some research papers. OK now there was there was a POC specification in the prompt and so before doing a large widespread data search, it gave me the first five responses that it could find one thing I found in all of these papers that it has shared with me is, I think it lacks the research papers lack a certain human element. I am more interested in finding out how people think how people make decisions and what kind of methodology and approach they use another thing that's important is you find the prompt attached below? There is also an instruction to search only for research papers now I think it followed that instruction well it was only looking for research papers, but the research papers are not all available to me, so I am a student at the University of Washington and so one thing I want operator to know is, I can only access papers that are available to university of Washington so there are a lot of publications and websites that allow someone to login through the university of Washington credentials, but there are also publications that don't have the option of even entering university of Washington as a login option so limit your search to papers that are accessible to students of university of Washington

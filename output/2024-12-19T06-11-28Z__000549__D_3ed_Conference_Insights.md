# D^3ed Conference Insights



## You (2024-12-19T06:11:28.566400+00:00)

I have a list of observations

____

I’m breaking down our observations into three spaces.


- Interviewee's opinion on content and presenters
- Interviewee's approach to networking
- Interviewee’s approach to self-education and problem-solving.
Content and Panelists
Content:
- None of the participants we interviewed joined the D^3ed conference with a specific agenda that is centered around the implementation and applications of AI within organizations.
- Some participants who were well versed in AI did state their desire to understand how leaders from different companies view the impact of AI.
- From the POV of experts in AI, the content fell into a balanced middle ground, where it was neither too technical nor too speculative or forward-thinking.
- From the POV of participants not too deep in AI, the conference acted as an introduction to the possibilities of AI, after which they wanted to learn more about applications of AI within their domain.

Interviewees expected the event to be a source of inspiration to either learn about a broad range of AI application. The sentiment was shared by both experts and novices in the field of AI. Given that some wanted variety, and others wanted depth, the event can be seen as a neutral middle ground, allowing attendees to choose their own path moving forward.


Panelists and Presenters:
- AI professionals mentioned a desire to talk to presenters; however, they expressed discomfort because they saw the presenters as celebrities.
- Participants who focus on mentoring startups felt that insights from representatives of large enterprises offered very little actionable information for small businesses.
- Investors with a strong technical background who diligently followed new research in AI had a neutral opinion of the presenters.
- Every participant mentioned Ethan Mollick’s presentation to be the most valuable for their time.


Staying engaged with missed content:
- Not being able to attend a presentation or workshop was seen as a missed opportunity, but given the wealth of content available today, the missed opportunity was not seen as worth pursuing once again.
- Some participants saw value in staying engaged with a forum (or get different attendees’ take) about missed presentations or workshops.


Approach to Networking
- While networking was mentioned as one of the objectives for attending the event, the general sentiment appeared to be relaxed and casual, where making connections was welcomed but not actively pursued with urgency or intensity.
- Whether the lack of networking was due to a lack of opportunity to network, or due to a rather wide variety of people (leaving attendees with few options to meet people with similar backgrounds) cannot be clearly determined from the interviews alone.
- Most participants believed that domain-specific events are more fruitful for pursuing professional relationships.


Self Education and Problem Solving
- The most common theme among participants was the emergence of ChatGPT as the initial source of addressing ambiguities and learning new concepts.
- Investors with advanced knowledge of AI mentioned subscribing to research papers to learn about new trends and advancements.
- Business Owners and investors wanted to talk to trusted experts within their circle for more information.
- 1 person mentioned learning about AI through books.

Could you synthesize them into key insights?

While writing insights, I want you to think like a storyteller. And when an insight is written, if we're being true to the word 'insight', then a listener should feel like they have learned more than they previously would've thought, and they now feel they are more informed. Here's an example of a well written insight,

"While experts believe that taking short breaks during work periodically can boost productivity, information workers still believe short breaks to be unimportant and avoidable."

## ChatGPT (2024-12-19T06:11:47.951306+00:00)

### Key Insights

#### **1. The D^3ed conference catered to a broad audience but left many desiring more targeted content.**
Participants viewed the event as a starting point to explore AI, with novices appreciating its introduction to possibilities and experts valuing the balanced middle ground between technical and speculative topics. However, this broad appeal revealed a trade-off: those seeking depth felt it lacked actionable takeaways, while others wishing for more variety found it restrained. The conference served as a neutral platform, but this neutrality underscored its limitations in satisfying diverse expectations fully.

---

#### **2. The conference’s presenters were revered but not approachable, creating a missed opportunity for deeper dialogue.**
AI professionals expressed admiration for presenters, often perceiving them as "celebrities," which deterred direct interaction. Meanwhile, mentors for startups found the insights from enterprise representatives disconnected from the realities of small businesses, and highly technical investors remained indifferent. Despite varying opinions on most presenters, Ethan Mollick's session emerged as the universally lauded highlight, suggesting that relatability and actionable insights resonate across audience types.

---

#### **3. Missed content did not drive FOMO but highlighted the need for peer-driven engagement.**
Participants did not feel compelled to revisit missed sessions, attributing this to the abundance of accessible AI content elsewhere. However, some expressed interest in informal discussions or forums where attendees could share their perspectives on sessions they attended. This suggests that the value of missed content may not lie in revisiting it but in fostering post-event dialogue among peers.

---

#### **4. Networking was relaxed and organic but lacked focus, limiting its professional impact.**
Although attendees appreciated the opportunity to meet others, networking felt incidental rather than intentional. This lack of urgency might stem from the event's diverse audience, leaving many without clear common ground. Participants noted that domain-specific events were more effective for building meaningful professional relationships, indicating a preference for tighter community alignment over broad exposure.

---

#### **5. ChatGPT has become the go-to tool for learning, shaping how participants self-educate.**
When faced with questions or ambiguities, most participants turned to ChatGPT as their first resource, underscoring its role as an immediate and accessible learning tool. Advanced users, like investors with technical expertise, supplemented this with academic research, while others relied on trusted experts within their networks. Notably, traditional learning methods like books were mentioned only in passing, hinting at a shift in how knowledge is sought and consumed in the AI era.

## You (2024-12-19T09:06:04.385703+00:00)

what does the phrase ontological proof mean

## ChatGPT (2024-12-19T09:06:13.863875+00:00)

The phrase **ontological proof** refers to a philosophical argument for the existence of God or a necessary being, based purely on reasoning and the concept of existence, rather than empirical evidence or observation.

### Key Aspects:
1. **Ontological**: Related to ontology, the branch of philosophy dealing with the nature of being, existence, or reality.
2. **Proof**: In this context, it is a logical or conceptual demonstration intended to establish the truth of a claim.

### Origins:
The concept originated with **Anselm of Canterbury** in the 11th century. His ontological argument proposed that:
- God is defined as the greatest conceivable being.
- It is greater to exist in reality than merely as an idea.
- Therefore, if God exists in the mind, God must also exist in reality to truly be the greatest conceivable being.

### Modern Variations:
Philosophers such as **René Descartes** and **Kurt Gödel** expanded on the argument, refining its logical framework. However, it has also been widely critiqued, with thinkers like **Immanuel Kant** arguing that "existence" is not a predicate or a defining property of a concept.

In summary, an ontological proof is an argument rooted in logic and definitions about the nature of being, primarily used in metaphysical and theological discussions.

## You (2024-12-19T09:07:18.221649+00:00)

I heard this in a sentence. Someone was saying there's no such thing as 'nice'. then the other person said, 'then why have the word'. then the first person said, 'ah! the ontological proof - existence of the word proves the existence of the concept'.

## ChatGPT (2024-12-19T09:07:28.461089+00:00)

In that exchange, the first person is humorously co-opting the idea of an **ontological proof** to make a point. They’re essentially saying:

- **The existence of the word “nice” proves the existence of the concept of “nice.”**

This mirrors the structure of an ontological proof, where the existence of a concept (like God, in classical philosophy) in our understanding is taken as evidence of its actual existence.

The humor or cleverness lies in applying a lofty, philosophical argument to something as mundane as the concept of being “nice.” It’s a playful way of saying that if we have a word for something, it must point to a real, existing idea or phenomenon—even if it’s abstract or subjective.

Whether the argument holds water depends on how strictly one interprets the connection between language and reality. It’s more a rhetorical flourish than a rigorous logical assertion!

## You (2024-12-19T09:24:27.314523+00:00)

Could u give me a better way of writing this

"People who hoped for case studies and practical knowledge had an even split between having a tech background and not having a tech background. "

I have this sentence

"People who appreciated (or had suggestions on event format) consisted of an even mix of people who liked or disliked other aspects of the event. "

give me another way of writing this, that essentially communicates that while people liked/disliked other aspects of the event, they all had good things to say about how well the event was organized

## You (2024-12-19T09:49:59.387434+00:00)

it wasn't unanimous, so let's rephrase this

## ChatGPT (2024-12-19T09:50:00.836233+00:00)

Attendees, regardless of their varied opinions on other aspects of the event, consistently highlighted the event's well-organized format or offered constructive suggestions for improvement.

To extract values from **Sheet2**, specifically from **columns C and H**, and place them into another sheet (e.g., **Sheet3**), starting from **row 2**, follow these steps depending on your platform:

---

### **Google Sheets**

Paste the following formula in **cell A2 of Sheet3**:

```excel
=ARRAYFORMULA(IF(ROW(C2:C)=2, "", FILTER({Sheet2!C2:C, Sheet2!H2:H}, Sheet2!B2:B<>"")))
```

- This pulls values from `Sheet2!C2:C` and `Sheet2!H2:H`
- It ignores rows where `Sheet2!B2:B` is blank (i.e., assumes question labels are present)
- Starts output from row 2 in **Sheet3**

---

### **Excel (Microsoft 365 / Excel 2021+)**

Paste the following formula in **cell A2 of Sheet3**:

```excel
=FILTER(CHOOSE({1,2}, Sheet2!C2:C1000, Sheet2!H2:H1000), Sheet2!B2:B1000<>"")
```

- Adjust the row range (`2:1000`) as needed for your data
- Assumes you want to exclude rows without question tags in column B

---

Let me know if:
- You want to include all rows regardless of column B
- You're using an older Excel version
- Destination sheet has a different name or structure

I can adjust accordingly.

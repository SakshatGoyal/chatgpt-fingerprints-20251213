I'd set up a figma mcp earlier but i'm a complete novice. I tried following the steps in this notion file but couldn't get far.

have a look at my terminal to get additional context. but when i visit the localhost site i see 'Cannot GET /mcp'

help me out here.

Short version: nothing is “broken” 🙂
`Cannot GET /mcp` just means you’re opening an MCP endpoint in a normal browser, which it isn’t designed for.

Your terminal log is actually telling us: ✅ the MCP server *is* running.

---

### 1. What your terminal is telling us

From your screenshot:

```text
> tsx src/index.ts
[figma-mcp] Starting MCP server on stdio…
[figma-mcp] env: FIGMA_TOKEN present
[figma-mcp] HTTP MCP ready at http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

This means:

- The server started correctly.
- It found `FIGMA_TOKEN` (so your env is okay).
- It opened an **MCP HTTP endpoint** at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`.

When you go to that URL in a browser, the browser sends a **GET** request.

Most MCP HTTP servers only speak **JSON-RPC over POST**, not “web pages”.
So Express (or whatever it’s using) replies: `Cannot GET /mcp`.

That’s normal.

---

### 2. So how are you *supposed* to use this?

You don’t interact with `http://localhost:3000/mcp` in Chrome/Safari.

Instead, some **MCP client** (like the ChatGPT Mac app) talks to it behind the scenes.

Since you’re on a MacBook Pro and using the native ChatGPT app, here’s the flow.

#### Step A – Keep the server running

1. Open Terminal.
2. Go to the project:

   ```bash
   cd figma-mcp
   ```

3. Start it:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Leave this window open** while you use ChatGPT.
   You should again see:

   ```text
   [figma-mcp] HTTP MCP ready at http://localhost:3000/mcp
   ```

---

#### Step B – Connect it to the ChatGPT app (MCP config)

In the **ChatGPT Mac app**:

1. Click your **name / three dots / Settings** (bottom-left).
2. Go to **Developer** or **Model Context Protocol** (wording may vary slightly).
3. Find **“Add MCP server”** or **“Configure MCP”**.
4. Choose **HTTP server** (not stdio).
5. Fill in:

   - **Name:** `figma-mcp` (or anything you like)
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/mcp`

6. Save.

That’s it. The ChatGPT app will now try to talk to your local MCP server via that URL using the MCP protocol (JSON-RPC), *not* by loading it like a web page.

---

### 3. How to see if it’s working in ChatGPT

After you’ve done the steps above:

1. Make sure `npm run dev` is still running in Terminal.
2. Open a **new chat** in the ChatGPT app.
3. Start typing something like:

   > Use the Figma MCP tools to list my files.

4. Look for:
   - A little **“Tools”** / **“MCP”** icon, or
   - Under the message box, a section that shows your custom server and its tools.

If the config is right and the server is running, you should see something like `figma-mcp` in the tools list, and the terminal will log requests as ChatGPT calls it.

---

### 4. Optional: if you *really* want a friendly page at `/mcp`

This is **not required** for MCP to work.
But just to reduce anxiety, you *could* add a simple GET route in your server like:

> “If someone opens /mcp in a browser, show a friendly ‘MCP server is running’ message.”

Because I don’t know your exact `src/index.ts`, I won’t give you a blind **FIND / REPLACE** edit here (I’d be guessing). But if you paste your `src/index.ts` file here, I can:

- Point to the exact lines,
- In your preferred format:
  - **FIND THIS → REPLACE WITH THIS**
  - Or **PASTE THIS ABOVE/BELOW THAT LINE**

so it’s copy-paste safe.

---

### 5. Summary

- `Cannot GET /mcp` in the browser ✅ does **not** mean the MCP is broken.
- Your log shows the **figma-mcp server is running correctly**.
- The missing piece is: **connect it as an MCP HTTP server inside the ChatGPT Mac app** and talk to it from there, not via the browser.

If you want, next step you can:

1. Paste your `src/index.ts` here, and
2. Tell me what you want the Figma MCP to actually *do* first (e.g., “list frames in a file”, “get a node’s styles”, etc.)

and I’ll walk you through both the code and the exact words to type in ChatGPT to trigger it.

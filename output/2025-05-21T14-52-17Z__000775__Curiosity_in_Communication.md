# Curiosity in Communication

## You (2025-05-21T14:52:17.182000+00:00)

I want to talk to you about making a fundamental change in an approach to communication. Usually, when people talk about good communicators like Henry Kissinger or Warren Buffett, the one thing in common is that they always ask more questions, trying to learn about a person, rather than trying to preach. However, what I've found is that this is much easier said than done. To do this, one needs to have a genuine curiosity and interest in another person, which is hard for most people to develop—especially those who believe they are intelligent or have a lot to share or don't know how to contribute to a conversation so they just say things about themselves to move the conversation forward. So its not that there's no desire to ask questions, there is. But that true feeling someone might have to learn about someone else is different.

You're highlighting a subtle but crucial distinction—there’s a gap between understanding that effective communication involves asking questions, and genuinely having curiosity about another person.

Indeed, true curiosity isn't something one can simply "perform." It requires humility, openness, and a mindset that deeply values the other person's experiences. Many intelligent people struggle with this because they're conditioned to contribute by sharing their own expertise rather than inviting others to share theirs.

A useful shift might involve reframing conversations from opportunities to demonstrate value into opportunities to discover value in others. To cultivate genuine curiosity:

- **Shift your goal:** Instead of aiming to be interesting, consciously aim to be interested.
- **Practice active listening:** Listen with intent to understand rather than respond.
- **Ask questions that matter:** Choose questions that encourage reflection or insight rather than surface-level replies.
- **Recognize the reward:** Realize that deeper conversations create meaningful connections, ultimately more satisfying than merely showcasing intelligence.

This mindset is a muscle—it grows stronger with intention and practice.

ok here're my thoughts—

- aiming to be interested, that's the goal right? I feel like you've reiterated the goal without providing a path to reach the goal. 
- Active listening: I've practiced that to a degree but two things happen
--1. On occasion people get uninterested or assume that you're just nodding along so its a bit of a turn off. 
--2. Sometimes, since I have adhd, it is hard to active listen. 
- Ask questions that matter: I think I'd like some examples for this one. 
- Recognize the reward: yes I already recognize the reward, but how do we get there?

Your reflections are insightful. Let's reframe the path toward genuinely becoming more interested and curious about others, specifically addressing your points:

## 1. **Active Listening (with ADHD consideration):**
Because you mentioned ADHD, active listening can become draining or challenging. To adapt this:

- **Narrate Internally:** Silently summarize points ("They're frustrated about this..." or "This matters deeply to them because...") to remain mentally engaged.
- **Ground Yourself:** If you drift, gently ground yourself by asking clarifying follow-up questions:
  - _“Can you explain more about how that made you feel?”_
  - _“What specifically stood out for you in that moment?”_

### Managing the perception you're just "nodding along":
- **Interject Thoughtfully:** Occasionally validate actively by sharing back your interpretation:
  - _“Let me see if I'm getting this right—you're saying...”_
- **Express Real-Time Interest:** Occasionally reflect genuine curiosity explicitly:
  - _“That's fascinating—I hadn't thought about it like that before. Why do you think that happened?”_

## 2. **Examples of Questions That Matter:**
These questions aim for depth, encouraging the other person to reflect, expand, and share authentic insights:

| Type of Question           | Example                                                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reflective Insight**     | _“Looking back, what did that experience teach you?”_       |
| **Motivation & Meaning**   | _“What about that work/project really inspires you?”_       |

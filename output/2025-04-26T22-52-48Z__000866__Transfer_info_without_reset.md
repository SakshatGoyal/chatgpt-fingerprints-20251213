# Transfer info without reset

## You (2025-04-26T22:52:48.641828+00:00)

I got a new pixel fold phone and I need to transfer info from my old android to my new phone. But I've already turned on my new phone so I can't do it the traditional way. How do I begin?

## ChatGPT (2025-04-26T22:52:49.549294+00:00)

Got it — since you've **already turned on your new Pixel Fold**, you can't use the **first boot "Copy apps & data" screen** automatically.  
But **you can still transfer everything** — you just have to do a **manual transfer** now.

Here's the best way to start:

---

### 1. Factory reset your Pixel Fold (optional but easier)

If you want the cleanest transfer (where it feels like you never skipped the setup wizard):

- **Open Settings** → **System** → **Reset options** → **Erase all data (factory reset)** → Confirm.

Then your Pixel will reboot and you'll be back at the original "Welcome!" screen — **and you can do the normal cable or wireless transfer** easily.

**OR**  
If you **don't** want to factory reset (you already set up stuff and don't want to lose it), you can **use Google's built-in "Data Restore Tool" app**.

---

### 2. If you *don't* want to reset, use the "Data Restore Tool":

- **On your Pixel Fold**, install or open the **"Data Restore Tool"** app.  
  (It might already be installed — check your app list.)
- Open it and **tap "Next"** → it will **simulate the setup transfer screen**.
- Then it will **guide you to connect your old phone**:
  - With a **cable**, or
  - **Wirelessly** over Wi-Fi.

You'll be able to transfer:
- Apps
- Contacts
- Photos
- Messages
- Settings
- Call history

It works almost exactly like first setup — just inside your already-set-up phone.

---

### Quick Decision:

| Situation | What you should do |
|:---|:---|
| You don't mind wiping the new phone | **Factory reset and restart setup** |
| You already set up things and don't want to reset | **Use Data Restore Tool app** |

---

Would you like me to walk you through step-by-step depending on which path you want?  
(Just say **"reset"** or **"no reset"** and I’ll guide you!)

## You (2025-04-26T22:54:21.473933+00:00)

I've done a factory reset, it's still booting up... What now?

## ChatGPT (2025-04-26T22:54:21.841956+00:00)

Perfect — you're almost there.

As soon as your Pixel Fold finishes rebooting after the factory reset, here's what to do next:

---

### Step-by-step after the reset:

1. **Language selection screen**  
   - Pick your language → tap **"Get Started"**.

2. **Connect to Wi-Fi**  
   - Choose your Wi-Fi network and connect.
   - (This is important because the transfer tool needs internet to check for updates.)

3. **On the "Copy apps & data" screen**  
   - You'll see: **"Use your old device"**.
   - Tap **"Next"**.

4. **Now set up the connection between your phones**:
   - **Option 1: Use a cable**  
     (Best: USB-C to USB-C cable. It's faster and more reliable.)
   - **Option 2: Use wireless transfer**  
     (If you don't have a cable handy.)

   **Tip:**  
   If you use a cable, you'll usually get a popup on your old phone asking **"Trust this device?"** — tap **"Yes"**.

5. **On your old phone**, unlock it and confirm the transfer when prompted.

6. **Choose what you want to copy**:
   - Apps
   - Contacts
   - Photos & videos
   - Messages
   - Settings
   - etc.

7. **Let the phones do their thing**  
   - The time it takes depends on how much data you have (sometimes 10 min, sometimes 1–2 hours).

8. **Finish setup on the Pixel Fold**  
   - After copying is done, the new phone will ask you a few more setup questions (Google Account, Face Unlock/Fingerprint, etc.).

---

You're back in the normal smooth transfer flow now.

**Is your Pixel Fold showing the "Copy apps & data" screen yet?**  
(If yes, I can guide you through connecting your old phone right now.)

## You (2025-04-26T23:11:21.487179+00:00)

Hey so I used copy apps and data, but somehow none of the apps and the app data was copied. Now what can I do?

## ChatGPT (2025-04-26T23:11:21.807380+00:00)

Got it — thanks for the quick update.

It sounds like **the "Copy apps and data" process only partially worked** — very common, especially if:
- The old phone had a lot of apps
- The Wi-Fi or cable had a hiccup during the transfer
- Some apps weren't available for automatic restore (rare but can happen)

**Here’s exactly what you can do now:**

---

### Step 1: Check if your **Google Account backup** exists

Even if the apps didn’t install right now, **Google usually made a backup on your old phone** earlier.

- On your **Pixel Fold**, go to:
  - **Settings** → **Google** → **Backup**
- See if it says something like "**Backup from [your old device] available**".

If yes, you can manually trigger a restore of apps from that backup.

---

### Step 2: Trigger **Play Store automatic re-install**

- Open the **Google Play Store** on your Pixel Fold
- Tap your **profile picture** (top right) → **Manage apps & device** → **Manage**
- Tap **"Not installed"** at the top — it will show apps tied to your Google account but not installed yet.
- You can **select them all** and tap **Install**.

This will reinstall all your apps in one batch.

**However,** this installs **apps** — not **in-app data** (like game progress, login states) unless the app itself syncs to the cloud.

---

### Step 3: Recover **App Data** (only if you had it backed up)

If app data (e.g., game saves, app settings) was backed up through:
- **Google Cloud backup** (automatic for many apps like WhatsApp, etc.)
- **Individual app accounts** (many apps like Instagram, Snapchat, banking apps, etc.)

Then **after reinstalling the app**, when you log back in, it will pull your data from the cloud.

**If you didn’t have a cloud backup, app data is not recoverable** now unless you re-transfer via the old phone manually.

---

### Step 4 (optional): **Use "Data Restore Tool" app manually**

If you want to try to **re-transfer** just apps + data **without resetting again**:

- Download and open the **"Data Restore Tool"** from the Play Store on your Pixel Fold.
- It lets you try another connection to the old phone and just transfer apps/data selectively.

**This method can sometimes fill in gaps without wiping anything.**

---

### In short:

| Problem | Fix |
|:---|:---|
| Apps didn’t transfer | Play Store > "Not Installed" > Install All |
| App data missing | Depends on whether the app had cloud backup |
| Want to try transferring again without full reset | Use **Data Restore Tool** |

---

Would you like me to guide you through trying the **Data Restore Tool** method?  
(It's usually pretty fast if you still have your old phone!)  
Just say "**yes**" and I'll walk you through it!

Does this mean the app's are slowly Bing installed?

## ChatGPT (2025-04-26T23:13:24.430032+00:00)

Yes, exactly — you're seeing the **Play Store queue** where your apps are **pending download and install**!

Here’s what’s happening based on your screenshot:

- Apps like **iMobile**, **IndiGo**, **IndusMobile**, etc. are **waiting** ("Pending...") to start downloading.
- Some apps like **IndiaMART** have already started (showing file size like 22 MB).
- The ones that say **Pending...** are just **waiting their turn** — the Play Store installs apps **one-by-one**, not all at once, to avoid network congestion.

---

**In simple terms:**  
Yes, your Pixel Fold **is working** — it's just **slowly reinstalling** everything in the background.

**If it feels stuck:**  
Here are a few quick tips to speed it up:
- Make sure your **Wi-Fi is strong and fast** (if not, switch to a better network).
- Open **Play Store > Settings > Network Preferences** and check if **"App download preference"** is set to **"Over any network"** (instead of only Wi-Fi).
- Keep the phone **plugged in** (charging) — sometimes Android queues downloads slower when low on battery.
- You can **tap the "X" next to a stuck app** to skip it if you don't urgently need it.

---

Would you like me to also show you a trick to **force them to all download faster at once** if you want? (It's a 30-second trick.)  
Just say "**yes**" if you want that!

## You (2025-04-27T04:08:51.443214+00:00)

Hey so I noticed the app's have come in but the apps are fresh... Meaning, the past data in the app's has not transfered. So like whatsapp.... I don't want to reenter all the details... Can I transfer the apps as they were?

## ChatGPT (2025-04-27T04:08:51.906009+00:00)

Got it — **very important catch.**  
You're right: **what happened is** the apps themselves reinstalled, but **their internal data (account info, history, settings)** didn't transfer.

**In short:**  
- **Apps installed = yes.**
- **App data = no, not automatically.**
  
---

### Here's why that happened:

When you did "Copy apps and data," it **only copies app data** *if*:
- The old phone had app data backed up to **Google Backup** or the app’s own cloud.
- OR you did a direct **cable-to-cable transfer** with full permissions for app data (sometimes missed if connection was wireless or flaky).

If that *didn’t happen*, **apps are fresh installs** and you have to set them up again manually.

**But there are some possible recoveries — depending on the app.**

---

### For WhatsApp (and similar apps):

**Specifically for WhatsApp**, **your chats and settings can still be recovered** *if*:

1. **You had WhatsApp Chat Backup enabled** (Google Drive backup).
2. Or you have a **local backup file** from your old phone.

---

#### How to recover WhatsApp *without reentering everything*:

**Option 1: Google Drive backup**
- Uninstall WhatsApp from your new phone.
- Reinstall WhatsApp.
- During setup, after you verify your phone number, it will **ask you "Restore from Google Drive?"** — say **YES**.
- It will pull your messages, media, and account details.

**Option 2: Local backup from old phone (harder but possible)**
- On old phone: check if you have a backup under `/WhatsApp/Databases/`
- You can transfer that manually by cable or cloud drive.

---

### Important:  
For **bank apps**, **travel apps**, etc. — **you almost always have to re-login manually** for security reasons.  
(They don’t allow data to transfer automatically, even with Google Backup.)

Only apps that save settings *inside your Google account* will restore automatically.

---

### Summary for your case:

| App Type | Can you recover old data? | What to do |
|:---|:---|:---|
| WhatsApp | Yes (if Google Drive backup exists) | Reinstall WhatsApp and restore from backup |
| Banking apps (e.g., ICICI, IndusMobile) | No | Re-login manually for security |
| Travel apps (e.g., Indigo) | No | Re-login manually |
| Other apps (games, tools) | Maybe (depends on app) | Check app's own cloud login |

---

### Final answer to your big question:
**Can you transfer apps *as they were*, with full data, now?**  
- **Not fully**, unless the app itself (like WhatsApp) has backup.
- **You can't redo the original "copy apps & data" step just for that** without another full factory reset + direct cable transfer.

Would you like me to walk you through **how to check if your WhatsApp backup exists right now** (so you can restore)?  
It’s super quick — just say "**check WhatsApp backup**" if yes!

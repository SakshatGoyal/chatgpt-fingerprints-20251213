#### Quick tips
- **When to go:** Farsan shops are best **breakfast to late‑morning**; locho often sells out. Piplod Night Bazaar and Zampa Bazaar are **evening/late‑night** scenes. citeturn6news30  
- **Seasonal must‑eat:** **Ponk** shows up only in winter; if you see ponk stalls around Athwa/Adajan, stop. citeturn4search18  
- **Take‑home:** Pack **ghari** (Kailash/Jamnadas) and **batasa/nankhatai** (Dotivala) for the road. citeturn3search12turn3search0turn0search3

If you’d like, I can also turn this into a **one‑day eating route** (breakfast → sweets → thali → sunset bhajiya at Dumas → egg trail → night bazaar), tailored to where you’ll be staying.

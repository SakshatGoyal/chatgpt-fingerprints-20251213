Here’s a research‑backed, local‑style shortlist of **20 Surat food stops**—with what to try at each. I’ve focused on Surti signatures (locho, sev khamani, ponk, ghari), beloved street hubs, and a few sit‑downs so you get the full flavor of the city.

### Street food & open‑air hubs
11) **Lashkari Bhajiya House (Dumas)** — Order: *Kanda/Tameta Bhajiya*. Pair sunset at Dumas beach with hot bhajiyas.
12) **Piplod Night Food Bazaar (SMC “Khau‑gali”)** — After 9 pm: multi‑stall street eats (North Indian, Chinese, quick bites). Great post‑Garba/nightlife scene.
13) **Gopi Talav Food Plaza (Gopipura)** — A designated **Clean Street Food Hub** by FSSAI—go for family‑friendly, hygienic stalls around the lake.
14) **Dattatrey Ponk Vada & Green Ponk (Athwa/Ashwini Kumar Rd)** — **Seasonal (roughly Nov–Feb)**: get fresh *ponk* and *ponk vada* when the Sorghum harvest hits town.

### Egg legends (Surat loves its omelettes)
15) **Chandan Omlet Center (City Light/Vesu side)** — 100+ egg dishes, from *Lahori* to big “8‑egg” gravies; perfect for groups.
16) **Egg Tadka (Adajan & Piplod)** — Late‑night friendly for *Lahori/Ghotala* styles and more.
17) **Bobby Omelet** — Seek out their *Egg Tikhari* specialty; a cult pick among egg stops.
18) **Sanjari “12‑Handi”/Barahandi (Zampa Bazaar)** — Nighttime non‑veg street: *Nihari*, *Paya*, *Hareesa* served from traditional pots.

### Other local staples to round it out
19) **Mahesh Pav Bhaji (Athwa & other outlets)** — Order: the buttery classic or “green” pav bhaji; lines form on weekends.
20) **Bouée Coffee Roasters (Vesu/Piplod)** — A specialty‑coffee, roastery‑style café open late—ideal between food crawls.

#### Quick tips
- **When to go:** Farsan shops are best **breakfast to late‑morning**; locho often sells out. Piplod Night Bazaar and Zampa Bazaar are **evening/late‑night** scenes.
- **Seasonal must‑eat:** **Ponk** shows up only in winter; if you see ponk stalls around Athwa/Adajan, stop.
- **Take‑home:** Pack **ghari** (Kailash/Jamnadas) and **batasa/nankhatai** (Dotivala) for the road.

If you’d like, I can also turn this into a **one‑day eating route** (breakfast → sweets → thali → sunset bhajiya at Dumas → egg trail → night bazaar), tailored to where you’ll be staying.

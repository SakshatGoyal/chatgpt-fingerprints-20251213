Hi, I need you to take a user interview question guide with introduction and modify it to match the profile I attach in this message. 

Make sure you don't fundamentally change the question or their order, but just make sure the context is more alligned to this user. 

For your information, this guide was made for a director of Product at squarespace. 

THe New guide is for a person named Akhil Shah.

Here's the old guide

Tim, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I’m Sakshat, Design Lead at Intelligaia, and I’m conducting this research as part of a study at the D³ Institute at HBS. We’re exploring how product leaders navigate ambiguity, competing priorities, and emerging technologies—especially in decision moments that rarely get captured in case studies or product retros.

Given your experience launching new ventures and scaling creator-facing tools at Squarespace, we’re especially interested in how you think through long-term direction, resolve trade-offs, and manage uncertainty in complex product environments. This will be a conversational discussion, so feel free to take things in directions that feel most relevant to your own experience.

There are no right or wrong answers here—we’re more interested in how you think than what you conclude. And at any point, if something needs clarification, just let me know.

Everything you share will be kept confidential and used only for internal learning. We’d like to record the session so we can revisit the details later—would that be alright with you?


Great—shall we jump in?


----------



- While i’ve gone through your profile, for the purposes of this conversation could you briefly describe your current role and some of the past experiences you’ve had working in the industry? 



You’ve worked in both startup-style teams and scaled orgs—what feels different about how decisions get made?
Follow-up:

- Is speed really about fewer layers—or something deeper, like ownership or trust?


 Our research shows that short-term urgencies often distort long-term vision. Could you share an example of how short-term pressures interfered with your team’s long-term priorities?
Follow-up:

- Is vision something you carry internally, share actively with your team, or revisit through rituals?



When you're shaping long-term product direction, what’s the hardest part?
Is it getting buy-in, staying anchored, making tradeoffs... or something else?



When you're setting direction or making a strategic call, how do you check for blind spots—things you don’t know you don’t know?
Follow-up:

- Is that a solo process, or do you bring others in to pressure-test your thinking?


In big decisions, whose input has the most influence on you?
Is it data? Direct reports? Customers? Exec peers?
Follow-up:

- Have you ever overruled the “right data” because something didn’t sit right?
- Are there voices you seek out specifically to challenge you?
- Can you remember a moment when you made a significant decision without having all the information you ideally wanted? What gave you the confidence to move forward anyway?


Let’s say a product manager on your team used ChatGPT or Gemini to critique their own roadmap proposal—maybe to pressure-test assumptions.
How would you respond to that?
Follow-up:

- Would you see it as thoughtful diligence—or raise concerns about data sensitivity or judgment?
- Do you ever see yourself trying to shape a strategy in collaboration with AI?






 Is there a category of judgment—big or small—you’d never want to outsource to AI, no matter how good it gets?
Follow-up:

- Is that about ethics, ownership, nuance… or just intuition?


If you could invent a new role on your team that would 10x your effectiveness, what would that person do all day?

Let’s say the company hired someone just like you—same skills, same brain—but they were working for you.
What would you delegate immediately? And what would you never let go of?

Here’s your updated interview guide, revised to reflect Akhil Shah’s background across health tech startups, venture advisory, and executive leadership roles—while keeping the structure and questions fundamentally intact:

**Akhil, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today.** I’m Sakshat, Design Lead at Intelligaia, and I’m conducting this research as part of a study at the D³ Institute at HBS. We’re exploring how executive leaders in health tech navigate ambiguity, competing priorities, and emerging technologies—especially in decision moments that rarely get captured in case studies or org retros.

Given your experience building and scaling care delivery models at Cityblock, leading integration and commercialization at Thirty Madison and Clover, and advising startups through Primary Venture Partners, we’re especially interested in how you think through long-term direction, resolve trade-offs, and manage uncertainty in complex operating environments. This will be a conversational discussion, so feel free to take things in directions that feel most relevant to your own experience.

There are no right or wrong answers here—we’re more interested in how you think than what you conclude. And at any point, if something needs clarification, just let me know.

Everything you share will be kept confidential and used only for internal learning. We’d like to record the session so we can revisit the details later—would that be alright with you?

ok, now can you do the same for this profile? While I want the questions to remain the same, I wanna see if you can maybe slightly modify the wording to fit the profile a little better. If you feel the question does not need to be modified for this profile, keep the question as is.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-01T20:28:27.043300+00:00)

Absolutely—here is the revised interview guide tailored to **Karen Levine**’s background in brand strategy, healthcare marketing, patient-centered campaigns, and creative leadership across major agencies and pharma accounts. The questions remain in their original order, but I’ve subtly adjusted the framing where helpful to better match her expertise and context.

**Karen, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today.** I’m Sakshat, Design Lead at Intelligaia, and I’m conducting this research as part of a study at the D³ Institute at HBS. We’re exploring how marketing and strategy leaders navigate ambiguity, shifting audience needs, and emerging technologies—especially in decision moments that rarely get captured in case studies or campaign retrospectives.

Given your leadership across brand strategy roles at Sanofi, Razorfish Health, imre, and Avalere Health—plus your track record launching impactful campaigns for both blockbuster drugs and niche therapies—we’re particularly interested in how you think through long-term positioning, navigate trade-offs in high-stakes storytelling, and manage uncertainty across complex healthcare and regulatory environments. This will be a conversational discussion, so feel free to take things in directions that feel most relevant to your own experience.

There are no right or wrong answers here—we’re more interested in how you think than what you conclude. And at any point, if something needs clarification, just let me know.

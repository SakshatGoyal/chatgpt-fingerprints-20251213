# Platos vegetarianos peruanos

Find me vegetarian Peruvian dishes, along with their recipes and ingredients needed. 

Avoid 'veganized' versions where the dish originally used meat but the meat was substituted with a plant-based alternative. An example I can give you is, in Ethiopian cuisine, while there is meat, there are also native vegetarian alternatives that only use beans, chickpea flour, lentils, etc..

Make sure to stay rooted in the culture. Imagine you are a chef who grew up in a modest family in Peru, and you are not showcasing home-cooked food that is Peruvian but can also appeal to a vegetarian. Do not modify or alter your cuisine to appeal to the vegetarian; stick to your roots.

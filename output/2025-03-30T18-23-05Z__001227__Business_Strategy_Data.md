# Business Strategy Data

## You (2025-03-30T18:23:05.525000+00:00)

### 🧭 Goal

Analyze a structured dataset where each row represents an analytical module, identified by `module_id` and described by **9 categorical tag columns**. Each column corresponds to a different thematic dimension.

Your goal is to extract up to four categories of interpretable insights based on **row-wise tag combinations and tag-level variation**, using a **column-prioritized matching strategy** that adapts to dataset size and thematic structure.

---

### 🧩 Priority Columns & Variable Definitions

Use the following **priority columns** to define dominant thematic combinations:

- `Ambiguity Type`
- `Framing Move`
- `Stabilizer`
- `Tension Axis`
- `Decision Outcome`

Let:

- `n` = the number of **priority columns** used to define a dominant tag combination
- `n-1` = the relaxed version used to explore tag-level variation

In this schema:

- `n = 5` (all five priority columns must match to define a dominant pattern)
- For Category 3, explore patterns that match on **n-1 = 4** of those columns

---

### 📦 Return Format

Return up to **three thematic clusters per category**. Each cluster must include:

- A short, observational **summary**
- The tag combination or tag-level pattern that defines the cluster
- A list of associated `module_id`s

> ✅ If fewer than three valid clusters exist, return only those supported by data. Do not fabricate clustersto fulfill quota.
> 

---

### CATEGORY 1: Most Common Tag Combinations (Using Priority Columns Only)

Identify the most frequent **row-level tag patterns** based only on the 5 priority columns.

For each of up to 3 clusters:

- Show the 5-tag combination (matching only those columns)
- Summarize the theme in plain terms
- List all `module_id`s that match this partial combination

> ⚠ Exclude patterns where the majority of priority tags are "Unknown".
> 

---

### CATEGORY 2: Least Common Full Combinations

Find rare **9-tag row-level combinations** that appear only once or twice in the dataset.

For each of up to 3 rare patterns:

- Show the full 9-tag tuple
- Note that it is rare (e.g., “appears once”)
- List the associated `module_id`s

> These will often yield 1–2 modules. This is expected.
> 

---

### CATEGORY 3: Least Common Tags Within Dominant Combinations (n–1 Strategy)

From the **dominant patterns in Category 1**, explore rows that match on **4 of the 5 priority columns**, and differ on the fifth.

Identify cases where the **non-matching tag**:

- Appears rarely in its column across the full dataset
- Is **not `"Unknown"`**

For each such variation:

- Specify the diverging column and rare tag
- Show the matching pattern it deviated from
- List `module_id`s that show this deviation

> This relaxed n–1 approach enables variation discovery even when Category 1 is tightly clustered.
> 

---

### CATEGORY 4: Most Common Tags Within Rare Combinations

Within the **rare full 9-tag tuples from Category 2**, find column-specific tags that:

- Appear **frequently across multiple rare combinations**
- Are **not `"Unknown"`**

For each case:

- Specify the column and recurring tag
- Show 2–3 different rare combinations where it appears
- List associated `module_id`s

# Insight Module Bucketing Help

## You (2025-03-25T09:19:04.807000+00:00)

Hey Michael, I have a series of insight modules and i need your help with a sort of bucketing activity. 

In another chat, we were able to figure out a way to bucket each of those insights based on which category of strategy they belong to. Now i want to bucket them based on 4 categories

1. Understanding How Executives Make Decisions
2. Understanding Challenges in Decision-Making
3. AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making
4. None of the above. 

I've attached a file that has the high level questions for your reference. As for the insight modules


### 📘 Each Insight Module Has Two Parts:

---

### **1. Insight Construction** *(Primary content)*

This is where the strategic idea is introduced, contextualized, and supported.

### 🔹 What to Look For:

- **Insight Statement**
    
    Concise, critical framing of a core idea. Often challenges prevailing logic or introduces a surprising pattern.
    
    > What assumption or mental model is being questioned?
    > 
- **Executive Decision-Making Context**
    
    Includes:
    
    - Strategic dilemma (what’s at stake?)
    - Underlying beliefs and biases (what assumptions are being surfaced?)
    - Expected vs. actual outcomes (what went differently than planned?)
    - Broader implications (what could change systemically?)
    
    > Who’s making the decision? What kind of decision is it? What organizational layer does it affect?
    > 
- **Supporting Context**
    
    Empirical grounding or theoretical basis for the insight. Includes references to data, frameworks, case studies, or precedent.
    
    > Does this insight come from market dynamics, internal operations, innovation logic, or individual reflection?
    > 

---

### **2. Insight Stress Test** *(Strategic diagnostic lens)*

This section pushes the insight into boundary conditions. It helps clarify **what the insight is not**, **where it breaks down**, and **what assumptions it hides**.



| Component | What It Tells You | Why It Matters Strategically |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Counterfactual Scenario** | A fictional case where the insight fails | Reveals *contextual boundaries*. Helps disqualify strategy types it might superficially resemble |
| **Assumptions & Biases** | Hidden cognitive shortcuts | Indicates *mental framing*—especially useful for spotting **Leadership**, **Business**, or **Innovation** logic |
| **Context Limitations** | Known edge cases where the insight breaks down | Helps narrow the scope of the insight (e.g., it may not apply org-wide, so not Corporate) |
| **Final Critique** | Conceptual tensions or contradictions | Great signal for identifying trade-offs—often highlights **Adaptive** or **Strategic Tension** dimensions clearly |

> ✅ Pro Tip: When you’re torn between two strategy types, the Stress Test often reveals the deeper logic underneath the surface framing.
> 

---

### 📌 When Reading, Ask:

- Is the insight driving **structural**, **competitive**, **executional**, **resilience**, **transformational**, or **personal** change?
- Who would need to act on this insight?
- Where would this insight break down—and does that tell me what kind of strategy it truly is?

Example of an Insight Module:

**INSIGHT MODULE 1**

Reconceptualizing Processes as Coordinated Competencies
Insight Statement:
The paper challenges conventional views by framing business processes not as static sequences of activities but as dynamic assemblies of coordinated competencies, where both human and machine cognitive abilities interweave to solve problems. [Empirical]

Executive Decision-Making Context:

Strategic Dilemma: Executives must choose between adhering to traditional, step-based process models or embracing a dynamic, competency-based approach that leverages distributed cognitive strengths.
Underlying Beliefs & Biases: There is a prevalent bias toward linear, predictable models, even when such approaches falter in complex, knowledge-intensive environments.
Expected vs. Actual Outcomes: Traditional methods promise efficiency through standardization; however, the framework suggests that a focus on integrated competencies can lead to more adaptable and resilient operations.
Broader Implications: Shifting to a competency-based model may necessitate rethinking investments in IT, training, and organizational design to foster effective knowledge coordination. [Inferred]
Supporting Context:
The authors build their argument on the knowledge-based theory of the firm, arguing that the true challenge lies in integrating specialist knowledge via distributed cognition. They articulate that process design should focus on orchestrating task competencies rather than merely structuring sequential activities. [Empirical]

🔹 COUNTERFACTUAL SCENARIO:

A large-scale manufacturing organization operates within a heavily regulated, safety-critical industry such as nuclear energy or aerospace. Regulatory compliance mandates explicit and rigid sequential procedures, leaving minimal scope for dynamic coordination. In this scenario, treating processes as dynamic cognitive assemblies leads to unpredictability, compliance failures, increased inspection costs, and potential safety hazards.

🔹 ASSUMPTIONS & BIASES:

Overconfidence in adaptability over standardized efficiency.
Assumption that dynamic cognition always outweighs procedural stability.
Ignoring regulatory and safety requirements as binding constraints.
🔹 CONTEXT LIMITATIONS:

This insight falters in environments requiring strict compliance, predictable repetition, or minimal variance. Industries such as pharmaceuticals, aviation, nuclear power, and financial auditing may reject dynamic interpretations due to regulatory and quality control demands.

🔹 FINAL CRITIQUE:

This insight introduces a conceptual tension: it implicitly undervalues scenarios where rigidity and predictability are strategically advantageous or legally necessary, potentially creating internal contradictions between innovation and compliance.

Perfect, I’ve got everything I need now—the bucketing categories, the detailed structure of each Insight Module, and the reference questions that define what each category means.

Here’s how we’ll approach the bucketing:

### ✅ Bucketing Criteria Breakdown

#### **1. Understanding How Executives Make Decisions**
- Focuses on *cognitive processes*, *frameworks*, *intuition vs. analysis*, *adaptability*, *data sources*, and *strategic thinking approaches*.
- Insight touches on how decisions are *structured*, *prioritized*, or *timed*—not just the obstacles.

#### **2. Understanding Challenges in Decision-Making**
- Centers on *frictions*, *failures*, *biases*, *bottlenecks*, *organizational politics*, and *second-guessing*.
- Includes both internal (stakeholder misalignment, mental traps) and external (pressure, risk, pace of change) inhibitors.

#### **3. AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making**
- Anything that includes *AI tools*, *decision augmentation*, *trust in automation*, *integration into workflows*, or *AI's effect on confidence, speed, or perception*.
- May include speculative or normative elements ("how AI *should* support decisions").

#### **4. None of the above**
- If it’s not explicitly about executive decision-making (or doesn’t relate to AI’s role in it), it lands here.
- For instance, if it's more about *market structure* than *how leaders act within it*.

---

### ✅ What I Need From You Next:
Please drop in the **insight modules** you'd like me to bucket—just paste them in here, one by one or all at once. I’ll handle categorizing them cleanly and explain why they land in each bucket. If you've got a bunch, feel free to chunk them into a few at a time.

Ready when you are.

## You (2025-03-25T09:25:25.624000+00:00)

No that won't be practical. I have about 950 insight modules. They've all been bucketed into 6 categories, but now our team is going to sift through them and do another bucketing. This new bucketing will help us answer specific questions about 

1. Understanding How Executives Make Decisions
2. Understanding Challenges in Decision-Making
3. AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making

And most importantly, it'll help us identify which insights to ignore, making our job much easier when we try to draw patterns. 

I'm thinking of creating a rubric for evaluating each insight on how well it answers the 3 questions. Based on that, I'd bucket them into different categories. 

Based on the research questions, I want to begin creating a brief outline of what the rubric might look like. 

I also want a mechanism that utilizes all the content, not just individual statements within an insight module

## ChatGPT (2025-03-25T09:25:27.157062+00:00)

That makes *a lot* of sense—especially given the volume you're working with. Designing a **rubric** to classify 950+ insight modules based on *their contribution to executive decision-making and AI strategy understanding* is exactly the kind of systematized thinking that'll keep your team aligned and focused.

Let’s start building the **rubric framework**, keeping in mind a few key design principles:

---

## ✅ Rubric Goals

1. **Distill relevance**: How directly and richly does the insight speak to one of the three core research areas?
2. **Leverage complete insight modules**: Avoid tunnel vision—use the full structure (construction + stress test) to assess depth and nuance.
3. **Support repeatability**: Different reviewers should arrive at similar judgments.
4. **Enable strategic sifting**: Make the "None of the Above" category a safe drop-zone for noise or tangential insights.

---

## 🧭 RUBRIC STRUCTURE

### For Each Insight Module, Evaluate Across Three Axes:

| **Dimension** | **Key Question** | **Scoring Criteria (0–2 scale)** |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| **A. Executive Decision Logic** | Does the insight help us understand *how* executives approach decision-making? | 0 = No relevance<br>1 = Surface-level or tangential (e.g., mentions decision-making but not the process)<br>2 = Substantive understanding of frameworks, priorities, heuristics, or mental models |
| **B. Decision-Making Challenges** | Does the insight reveal specific *barriers*, *biases*, or *points of friction* in executive decision-making? | 0 = No relevance<br>1 = General mention of problems, but not well contextualized<br>2 = Clear articulation of tensions, misalignments, or breakdowns in execution |
| **C. AI’s Strategic Role** | Does the insight advance understanding of AI’s involvement in, or impact on, decision-making? | 0 = No mention of AI<br>1 = AI mentioned but not in a decision-making context<br>2 = Clear framing of AI’s role (augmenting, influencing, reshaping decisions) |
| **D. Signal Strength** *(Optional)* | How strategically insightful or novel is the module overall? | 0 = Weak signal, possibly discard<br>1 = Conventional but usable<br>2 = Distinctly thought-provoking, may suggest new direction or pattern |

---

## 📦 CATEGORY BUCKETING LOGIC

Use the scores to assign each module to a primary bucket:

| **Bucket** | **Scoring Logic** |
|------------|-------------------|
| **1. Understanding How Executives Make Decisions** | A = 2, B ≤ 1, C ≤ 1 |
| **2. Understanding Challenges in Decision-Making** | B = 2, A ≤ 1, C ≤ 1 |
| **3. AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making** | C = 2 (regardless of A or B) |
| **4. None of the Above** | A + B + C = 0 or only 1’s across the board |
| **Bonus: Dual Themes** | Two 2’s across A, B, C → flag as a possible crossover module for deeper synthesis |

---

## 🛠 Implementation Tips

- **Tag Modules**: Use metadata to tag each module with its scores (e.g., A1-B2-C0). Makes later filtering easy.
- **Patterning Layer**: After bucketing, you can later cluster high-signal modules within each category to uncover themes or build narratives.
- **Team Calibration**: Have multiple reviewers code a subset (say 20 modules), then compare for scoring consistency. Refine criteria as needed.

---

## 📌 Next Steps

1. Do you want help drafting a **rubric worksheet or scoring template** (e.g., Airtable/Notion/Google Sheet format)?
2. Would it help to have **example modules scored using this rubric**?
3. Are you planning to have **individual reviewers score manually**, or are you considering some automated triage support (e.g., LLM pass to generate first-pass scores)?

Let me know how you’d like to operationalize this—happy to help build out the infrastructure too.

## You (2025-03-25T09:32:08.444000+00:00)

we'll need a more detailed rubric to be honest. I mean some of these questions are very generic. can we further breakdown what we mean by the following questions

Does the insight help us understand how executives approach decision-making?	
Does the insight reveal specific barriers, biases, or points of friction in executive decision-making?	
Does the insight advance understanding of AI’s involvement in, or impact on, decision-making?	

Use the Research questions i gave you as a reference. 

A few more things, 

1. our insights were drawn from research papers. they don't always talk about individuals, but rather generalize people across heirarchy, industry, class, industry, etc... we'll need to keep that in mind
2. I'm attaching a small file that has some sample insight modules for you to refer from. To be honest, I don't think these questions are deep enough for us to really make sense of how to rate each criteria

## ChatGPT (2025-03-25T09:32:09.699217+00:00)

Excellent. Based on everything you've provided—including the original research questions, your volume and source context (academic/literature-driven insights), and the deep structure of the sample modules—here's a more **rigorous, multi-dimensional rubric** broken down by each of the three strategic questions you're answering.

---

## 🎯 Rubric for Strategic Relevance of Insight Modules

This rubric is **not just a scoring scale**—it's designed to help human reviewers (or automation) evaluate how well each module contributes to your synthesis goals.

Each of the three *strategic questions* is unpacked into **sub-dimensions**, each with examples and judgment criteria. This makes your evaluation more grounded, consistent, and actionable.

---

### ✅ CATEGORY 1: **Understanding How Executives Make Decisions**

#### 🔍 Key Sub-Dimensions:

| Sub-Dimension | What to Look For | Examples & Criteria |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Cognitive Models & Frameworks** | Explicit or inferred mental models, schemas, or heuristics executives use to decide | “Risk-averse executives default to incrementalism despite market shifts” → **Strong**<br>“Leaders adapt in uncertainty” → **Weak/general** |
| **Decision Typologies** | Differentiation between high/low-stakes, tactical/strategic, short/long-term decisions | “AI useful for short-term optimization, not for long-term vision-setting” |
| **Information Use & Interpretation** | Data, experience, intuition, or judgment drivers; when and why each is trusted or ignored | “Executives override dashboards in high-stakes crises” |
| **Timing & Triggers** | How decisions are timed—what causes delay, acceleration, or reversal | “Strategic inflection points emerge only when KPIs drop 3 quarters in a row” |
| **Role Differentiation Across Levels** | Insight describes variance in decision approaches by hierarchy, industry, or function | “Product leaders use experimentation logic; finance leaders use precedent logic” |

---

### ✅ CATEGORY 2: **Understanding Challenges in Decision-Making**

#### 🔍 Key Sub-Dimensions:

| Sub-Dimension | What to Look For | Examples & Criteria |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Cognitive Bias & Misalignment** | Identifiable cognitive traps, anchoring, status quo bias, overconfidence, etc. | “Executives assume scale = innovation” |
| **Executional Friction** | Delays, miscommunications, bureaucratic blockers in acting on decisions | “Strategy stalls at middle management due to unclear incentives” |
| **Crisis, Uncertainty, & Contradiction** | Descriptions of how decisions change under stress or when information is conflicting | “Leaders revert to legacy KPIs in volatile markets, despite new metrics” |
| **Organizational Politics & Culture** | Internal resistance, misaligned incentives, or silos as blockers to execution | “Innovation teams fear backlash from operational leaders” |
| **Failure Modes** | Descriptions of why seemingly sound decisions fail in hindsight | “Assumed customer loyalty proved unstable under pricing shift” |

---

### ✅ CATEGORY 3: **AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making**

#### 🔍 Key Sub-Dimensions:

| Sub-Dimension | What to Look For | Examples & Criteria |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Trust in AI Recommendations** | How executives calibrate belief in machine-generated suggestions | “AI more trusted when it confirms team consensus” |
| **Delegation & Control** | What kinds of decisions execs are willing to automate or not | “Executives delegate data prioritization to AI, but not scenario framing” |
| **Integration into Workflows** | How AI is embedded into real decision flows (versus hypotheticals) | “AI assists in site selection during clinical trials” |
| **Trade-offs & Side Effects** | New frictions introduced by AI (e.g., loss of novelty, homogenization) | “AI narrows strategy options to historical clusters” |
| **Comparative Logic** | How execs weigh AI vs. human, or intuition vs. algorithm | “AI is seen as second-opinion, not first-mover in strategy” |

---

### 🟫 CATEGORY 4: **None of the Above / Strategic Noise**

| Use When | Indicators |
|----------|------------|
| - The insight doesn’t help us learn *how*, *why*, or *what* executives do strategically <br> - The insight is too context-specific (e.g., market dynamics with no decision framing) <br> - The insight is about *outcomes* but not decision *processes* | “Company X gained market share through partnerships” without describing how or why the decision was made |

---

## 🧮 Scoring Framework

Each sub-dimension is scored 0–2. But you don’t need to score every sub-dimension—rather, score those **that are present** in the module. Then:

- **Primary Category = the one with the highest-weighted total**
- **Dual Fit = two categories have strong (e.g., 2s) in at least two sub-dimensions**
- **"None" = all scores are 0 or 1s in weak signals across the board**

---

## 📘 Sample Application (from the Starbucks example you shared):

> “Phased expansion enables continuous learning in uncertain markets”

- **Decision Models**: 2 (Describes phased vs. decisive strategy)
- **Executional Friction**: 1 (Slow cycle risk)
- **Cognitive Bias**: 2 (Trend-following bias)
- **AI**: 0

➡️ **Category 1** (How Executives Make Decisions) — with mild signal in Category 2

---

Would you like this turned into a **spreadsheet scoring template** or integrated into a Notion/Airtable structure for your team to use? I can also walk through scoring 1–2 modules based on this new rubric to show how it comes together in action.

## You (2025-03-25T09:37:44.131000+00:00)

Ok, now i want you to think like a creative director at frog who excells at turning insightful yet open-ended information into actionable decisions. 

in an earlier bucketing, we used this structure

### 🔹 **Step 2: Score Across the Five Strategic Lenses**

> What You’re Doing:
> 
> 
> For each of the six strategy types, you’ll rate how strongly the insight aligns with that strategy across **five lenses**. Each lens gives you a different perspective to help identify the dominant strategic logic.
> 

### 🎯 Scoring Scale (Per Lens, Per Strategy Type):

- **5 = Strong Alignment** → This dimension clearly aligns with this strategy type
- **3 = Partial Alignment** → Some elements are present, but not core
- **1 = Not Aligned** → No meaningful connection

### 🧠 The Five Strategic Lenses:

| Lens | Anchor Question | Use This Lens To… |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Decision Layer** | *Who makes the decision?* | Clarify the organizational level: Is this a C-suite move (Corporate)? A team lead? A personal mindset shift? |
| **2. Strategic Tension** | *What’s the dilemma or tradeoff?* | Identify competing forces: efficiency vs. flexibility, risk vs. growth, structure vs. adaptability. |
| **3. Strategic Intent** | *What is the insight trying to achieve?* | Is the goal to win, adapt, disrupt, optimize, or grow personally? Intent separates strategy types with similar content. |
| **4. Scope & Time Horizon** | *How broad and durable is the impact?* | Is this about a team, a product line, or the entire organization? Is the time frame reactive, medium-term, or visionary? |
| **5. Cognitive Framing** | *What way of thinking is being modeled?* | Is the insight promoting a new paradigm, a risk model, a process, or a mindset shift? What’s the mental logic behind the advice? |

### 📝 How to Fill Out the Score Table:

Create a grid or use the provided template to score like this:

| Strategy Type | Lens 1 | Lens 2 | Lens 3 | Lens 4 | Lens 5 | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Corporate-Level | 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 20 |
| Business-Level | 2 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 2 | 17 |
| Functional & Tactical | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 11 |
| … | … | … | … | … | … | … |


### 👇 For Each Strategy Type, You’ll Find:

1. A **definition paragraph** that explains its purpose and typical context
2. **Common misreads or overlaps**—so you don’t get tricked by surface features
3. **Example strategic decisions**—real-world-style cases
4. A visual **Scope × Intent grid** to support triangulation

---

## 🔷 1. **Corporate-Level Strategy**

**Definition:**

Corporate Strategy involves **long-term, organization-wide decisions** about where the company plays and how resources are allocated across its portfolio. It shapes the company's overall direction, including market entry/exit, diversification, mergers and acquisitions, or structural transformation. These decisions usually originate from the CEO, board, or chief strategy roles.

**Common Misreads / Overlaps:**

- ❌ Not just "big" = corporate. If a decision only affects one product, market, or business unit, it's likely Business-Level.
- ❌ CEO-driven does not always = Corporate Strategy. If it’s about leadership development or mindset, it could be Leadership Strategy.

**Example Strategic Decisions:**

- Google acquiring DeepMind to reshape its AI portfolio
- Disney launching a direct-to-consumer platform to restructure its media business
- A holding company deciding to exit an entire industry vertical

---

## 🔷 2. **Business-Level Strategy**

**Definition:**

Business Strategy is about **how a business unit competes** in its market. It focuses on positioning, pricing, differentiation, segmentation, and go-to-market decisions. These strategies are typically driven by general managers, product leaders, or business unit heads, and they operate within a specific market context.

...
...
...
...

The advantage was, it was a single table. Every insight was evaluated across multiple questrions but were scored on a single table. Could we possible find a way to create a rubric like this one? Keep in mind, the example I'm sharing was for a different use case entirely. Now the question is, which type of question does an insight help us answer, and is it possible that it doesn't answer any of the questions.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-25T09:37:45.305038+00:00)

Absolutely—this is exactly the kind of structured synthesis a creative director at frog would lean into: clarity, convergence, and *flexibility without ambiguity*.

You're not just labeling content—you’re **mapping insight density across a spectrum of relevance**. And just like your earlier “strategy lenses” rubric helped differentiate strategic *types*, this new version can help differentiate *insight utility* based on the three decision-making questions you’re working with.

---

## ✅ Proposed Rubric: Multi-Lens Evaluation for Insight Relevance  
**Goal:** Classify each insight module by evaluating its relevance across **three thematic "question domains"**—with the same lens structure as your earlier rubric.  
You score each **question domain** using **five strategic lenses**—then the total score signals which bucket it falls into. If no domain clears a threshold, it’s marked **“None of the Above.”**

---

## 🧠 The Five Strategic Lenses (Repurposed)

| Lens | Anchor Question | What to Look For |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| **1. Decision Layer** | *Who is being generalized?* | Does the insight refer to executives (explicitly or implicitly), or is it too diffuse (industry, consumers, macro only)? |
| **2. Strategic Tension** | *What’s the dilemma or unresolved friction?* | Are there opposing forces at play (e.g. short-term vs. long-term, AI vs. human, speed vs. depth)? |
| **3. Intent Signal** | *What kind of learning or shift is this insight pointing to?* | Is the insight revealing a mental model, exposing a bias, suggesting a better decision mechanism? |
| **4. System Boundaries** | *How wide and deep is the impact?* | Does the insight deal with individual cognitive patterns, intra-org frictions, or cross-system shifts (like trust in AI)? |
| **5. Mental Framing** | *How is the decision-making process being conceptualized?* | Is it framed as data-driven, intuition-driven, politically constrained, AI-augmented, etc.? |

---

## 🎯 Thematic Buckets

Each insight is evaluated **per question domain** using the five lenses.

| Question Domain | Guiding Focus |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Q1: How Executives Make Decisions** | Models, heuristics, timing, confidence, cognitive architecture |
| **Q2: Challenges in Executive Decision-Making** | Biases, bottlenecks, stakeholder friction, uncertainty |
| **Q3: AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making** | Trust, augmentation, delegation, governance, automation impact |

---

## 📝 Rubric Table Example

You’d use a table like this for each insight:

| **Question Domain** | Lens 1: Decision Layer | Lens 2: Tension | Lens 3: Intent | Lens 4: System Boundaries | Lens 5: Mental Framing | **Total** |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| **Q1: Exec Decision-Making** | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | **19** |
| **Q2: Challenges** | 2 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | **15** |
| **Q3: AI’s Role** | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | **8** |

From here, you'd apply **bucket rules**:

---

## 📦 Final Categorization Rules

| Bucket | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Q1 – Understanding How Executives Make Decisions** | Highest score is Q1 **AND** total ≥ 15 |
| **Q2 – Understanding Challenges** | Highest score is Q2 **AND** total ≥ 15 |
| **Q3 – AI’s Role** | Highest score is Q3 **AND** total ≥ 12 *(lower threshold due to recency & nuance)* |
| **None of the Above** | All scores <12 or no dominant domain (within 2 pts across all) |

> 🔁 *Optional:* Add a **“Dual Fit” flag** if two domains both score ≥15 and are within 2 points of each other. These can be set aside for mixed-theme synthesis later.

---

## 📘 Example: Starbucks Phased Expansion Module

| **Question Domain** | DL | Tension | Intent | System | Framing | **Total** |
|---------------------|----|---------|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| Q1 – Exec Decision-Making | 4 (execs must balance expansion) | 5 (caution vs. agility) | 4 | 4 | 3 | **20** |
| Q2 – Challenges | 2 | 4 (slow learning in volatile markets) | 2 | 3 | 2 | **13** |
| Q3 – AI’s Role | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | **6** |

**✅ Final Bucket:** Q1 – *How Executives Make Decisions*

---

## 🛠 Want to Operationalize This?

I can help you generate:
- A **Google Sheet/Airtable template** pre-loaded with this rubric
- A **codebook for scorers** with detailed examples per lens
- A **scoring walkthrough** for your team to calibrate together (e.g.

## You (2025-03-25T09:39:19.223000+00:00)

I don't want you to repurpose anything. that's a very unproductive way and frankly not accurate for our unique use case.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-25T09:39:20.575548+00:00)

Thank you for that directness—and you're absolutely right.

This is *not* a repurposing job. Your use case is fundamentally different from strategy typing. Here, you're trying to assess **insight contribution** to *three very specific research questions*, not classify by logic type. That means we need to **design a new rubric from the ground up**—built on the logic and structure of your **interview questions**, **research objectives**, and **module anatomy** (Construction + Stress Test).

Let’s start fresh.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Design a rubric that helps reviewers evaluate **how strongly an insight module contributes to answering one of three key research questions**, by assessing the depth, relevance, and specificity of the full module content—not just individual statements.

---

## ✅ Part 1: Clarifying the Three Question Domains

Let’s refine what each question is really trying to get at—grounded in your uploaded research questions.

---

### 🟦 **Q1: Understanding How Executives Make Decisions**

This includes:
- The *processes* executives use (explicit or implicit)
- *Mental models*, heuristics, or shortcuts
- Decision *triggers*, *timing*, and *confidence thresholds*
- *Delegation vs. ownership* patterns
- Use of *intuition*, *data*, *past experience*
- Variation by *industry*, *firm size*, *hierarchy*

> ✅ We're looking for *mechanisms and reasoning patterns* behind decision-making—across any level generalized as “executive.”

---

### 🟥 **Q2: Understanding Challenges in Decision-Making**

This includes:
- *Cognitive biases* (status quo, confirmation, overconfidence)
- Organizational frictions (stakeholder misalignment, resistance to change)
- External constraints (regulation, market timing, risk)
- Failure modes, second-guessing, or unintended outcomes
- Internal politics, delay, or uncertainty amplification

> ✅ We're looking for *barriers, breakdowns, tensions,* and *obstacles*—anything that interferes with or complicates executive decisions.

---

### 🟨 **Q3: AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making**

This includes:
- Where AI supports, augments, or replaces human judgment
- *Trust, credibility,* and *interpretability* issues
- Delegation logic—what gets handed to AI, what doesn’t
- *Workflow integration*, adoption barriers, or organizational readiness
- Impact on *speed*, *insight diversity*, or *strategic quality*

> ✅ We're looking for *how AI changes, supports, or reshapes* decision-making behavior, perception, and processes—either explicitly or implicitly.

---

## ✅ Part 2: Rubric Structure

For each module, score **each question domain** along **three original dimensions**:

---

### 📐 Rubric Dimensions

| Dimension | What It Evaluates | Scoring Guidance |
|----------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Relevance** | Does the insight directly speak to the question, or only tangentially? | 0 = No connection<br>1 = Weak/indirect<br>2 = Partially relevant<br>3 = Clearly relevant<br>4 = Highly relevant and central |
| **Depth** | Does the insight meaningfully unpack the topic, or just touch the surface? | 0 = No depth<br>1 = Mentions idea but no mechanisms<br>2 = Some explanation<br>3 = Deep framing or context<br>4 = Clear mechanism or systemic lens |
| **Specificity** | Does the insight describe specific decision behaviors, contexts, or mechanisms? | 0 = Abstract/general<br>1 = High-level only<br>2 = Named actors/contexts<br>3 = Behaviorally specific<br>4 = Rich, scenario-based or with layered detail |

→ **Total Score per Question Domain: 0–12**

---

## ✅ Part 3: Interpretation Logic

| Bucket | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **Q1 – How Execs Make Decisions** | Highest score among the three, and **≥ 8** |
| **Q2 – Challenges in Decision-Making** | Highest score, and **≥ 8** |
| **Q3 – AI’s Role** | Highest score, and **≥ 7** (AI themes tend to be more nuanced/subtle) |
| **None of the Above** | No score ≥ 7, or flat signals across all domains (e.g. 5–5–4 or 6–6–6) |

> 💡 Add a **“Secondary Fit” tag** if another domain scores ≥ 8 but isn’t the highest. Useful for multi-theme modules.

## 🧪 Would You Like a Scoring Template?

I can create:
- A **Google Sheet** or **Airtable** version
- A **PDF codebook** version for training reviewers
- A few **scored examples** from your modules using this exact structure

Let me know how you’d like to proceed next:
- Build a scorer training tool?
- Score a few together for calibration?
- Help operationalize into a dashboard or tagging system?

## You (2025-03-25T09:42:12.939000+00:00)

help me expand on the rubric dimensions? are you making any use of the research questions document i attached?

## ChatGPT (2025-03-25T09:42:14.145511+00:00)

Yes—and thank you for the reminder to make that connection explicit. I *did* use the research questions document when defining the **question domains** (Q1–Q3), but now you’re asking the right next question:

> Can we **ground the rubric dimensions (Relevance, Depth, Specificity)** in the actual language and logic of the research questions?

Let’s do that in two moves:
1. **Revisit the rubric dimensions**—then
2. **Anchor each one directly in the structure and language of the research questions** you gave me.

---

## ✅ 1. Reframing the Rubric Dimensions with Greater Precision

Let’s sharpen the language of each dimension and expand what to look for.

---

### 📘 Dimension 1: **Relevance**
> *How directly does the insight address the intent of the research question?*

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **0** | No relevance at all | Entirely unrelated topic (e.g., operational cost metrics without decision context) |
| **1** | Extremely weak or implied connection | Vague gestures toward the theme, but no clarity (e.g., “leadership matters” with no decision framing) |
| **2** | Indirect relevance | Touches on related themes (e.g., innovation, process change) but doesn’t clearly speak to decision-making |
| **3** | Direct relevance | Speaks clearly to how decisions are made, challenged, or shaped—matches the question intent |
| **4** | Central, laser-focused relevance | The insight *exists to answer* the kind of question we’re exploring—it’s built around decision behavior, barriers, or AI impacts |

🔹 **Where the Research Questions Come In**:  
Use them as **“truth anchors.”** If the insight clearly helps answer *any* of the sub-questions under that domain (e.g., “What types of decisions do executives avoid or delegate?” in Q1), it should score 3 or 4.

---

### 📘 Dimension 2: **Depth**
> *Does the insight explain the underlying logic, mechanisms, or systems behind the behavior?*

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **0** | No exploration at all | Claims without rationale (e.g., “Executives struggle with AI adoption.” Full stop.) |
| **1** | Superficial mention | Names a concept or problem but doesn’t unpack it |
| **2** | Surface mechanism or causal relationship | Begins to show how or why something happens (e.g., mentions bias or tradeoff) |
| **3** | Moderate explanatory depth | Shows competing forces, systemic relationships, organizational dynamics, or underlying logic |
| **4** | Rich diagnostic framing | Offers conceptual clarity, identifies root causes or paradoxes, connects individual behavior to organizational or systemic implications |

🔹 **Where the Research Questions Come In**:  
They already assume you’re seeking explanations, not just themes. For instance, in Q2: “What factors make a decision feel like ‘the wrong call’ in hindsight?” demands that an insight explains *why* a decision failed—not just that it did.

---

### 📘 Dimension 3: **Specificity**
> *Does the insight describe particular behaviors, roles, scenarios, or conditions—not just abstract ideas?*

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **0** | No detail or context | Generic statement (e.g., “AI helps decision-making.”) |
| **1** | High-level generalization | Uses vague or universal language: “Leaders must evolve” |
| **2** | Includes some contextual markers | Mentions company size, market, or position (e.g., “pharma executives” or “startups in Asia”) |
| **3** | Describes decision behavior or actor categories | Clear actions, judgments, tradeoffs, or role-based patterns |
| **4** | Rich situational context | Combines actors, environments, decision types, or tensions (e.g., “CFOs in regulated financial firms delegate product innovation decisions but retain budget authority”) |

🔹 **Where the Research Questions Come In**:  
Many of them focus on **“when,” “why,” “how,” and “who”**—not just *what*. That gives you specificity targets. For instance, Q1: “How do executives manage contradictory or incomplete information?” invites stories of *specific behaviors* under *particular pressures*.

## ✅ 2. Directly Mapping Research Questions to Rubric Dimensions

Let’s take one domain as an example—**Q1: How Executives Make Decisions**—and connect it to the rubric dimensions:

---

### 🔵 Relevance for Q1:
Does the insight speak to:
- Confidence in decisions?
- Heuristics used in rapid choices?
- Delegation behavior?
- Course correction after failure?
- Mental models around risk, timing, or uncertainty?
If so → Score 3–4

---

### 🔵 Depth for Q1:
Does the insight reveal:
- Internal contradictions in decision logic?
- Underlying assumptions?
- Organizational structures that shape decision behavior?
- Mental shortcuts or framing effects?
If yes → Higher depth score

---

### 🔵 Specificity for Q1:
Does the insight…
- Name decision-makers (explicitly or implicitly)?
- Describe the *kind* of decision?
- Situate it in industry, scale, or risk environment?
- Provide examples or scenarios?
If yes → Score 3–4

---

Let me know if you'd like me to do this **mapping for all three question domains** (Q1–Q3), and I can turn that into a reviewer-ready **rubric guide**.

Would you also like an example rubric *filled out* for one or two of the insight modules you shared earlier?

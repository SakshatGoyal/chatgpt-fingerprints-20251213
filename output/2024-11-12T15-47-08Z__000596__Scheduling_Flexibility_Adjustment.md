Hi Adolfo,

I’m Tanya, a Senior Product Manager working on new verticals for the D^3 Institute at Harvard.

Reflecting on our ‘Leading with AI’ event at HBS, your response about disrupting energy management with AI echoed our perspective. 

I’m working to understand how events like ours help entrepreneurs like you implement AI in specific sectors, and where we could deepen their impact. Your experiences could provide valuable insights into how we can enhance these events to make each event worthwhile for the time and effort you invest.

**If this resonates with you, would you be open to a 45-minute conversation sometime over the next three weeks? I’d love to hear about your approach to these events, learn from your experiences, and share more about an exploratory project I'm working on that aims to make such events more impactful.**

I look forward to the possibility of connecting!

Thank You,

# Monty Hall Problem

## You (2025-06-06T02:47:35.532000+00:00)

You're on a game show, and there are three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then asks you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Yes, **it is to your advantage to switch**.

This is the famous **Monty Hall problem**, and the counterintuitive but mathematically correct answer is that **you should always switch**. Here's why:

### 📊 Probability Breakdown

1. **When you first choose a door** (say, Door 1), there's a:
   - **1/3 chance** the car is behind Door 1
   - **2/3 chance** the car is behind one of the other two doors (Door 2 or Door 3)

2. **The host then opens a door with a goat** — and **he *always* opens a goat door**, never the car.
   - This act gives you information: he's reducing the uncertainty from the remaining doors.

3. **When the host opens Door 3 and reveals a goat**, the **2/3 probability "shifts" to Door 2**, because Door 3 is now eliminated.

### 🔁 Summary

| Choice         | Probability of Winning the Car |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Stay (Door 1)  | 1/3                            |
| Switch (Door 2)| 2/3                            |

So:
✅ **Switching gives you a 2/3 chance of winning**
❌ **Staying gives you only a 1/3 chance**

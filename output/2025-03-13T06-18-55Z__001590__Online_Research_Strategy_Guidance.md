# Online Research Strategy Guidance

## You (2025-03-13T06:18:55.025000+00:00)

Hey Andrew, I want you to create a prompt for 4o to do some online research. 

I was given this task from my boss. I need the model to do a deep search online and help me with step 2, based on the instructions of step 1. So i really need you to clearly step by step think through how you might frame the instructions for the other gpt. 

My objective is to collect hyperlinks for as many resources as part of step 2. the resources should align with the instructions shared by my boss about the directive of this project. 

Recommended Sources to Prioritize
✅ Academic Journals: For theoretical frameworks (e.g., Strategic Management Journal, Harvard Business Review, MIT Sloan Management Review).
✅ Industry Reports & White Papers: To uncover real-world trends (e.g., McKinsey, BCG, Gartner, Forrester).
✅ Case Studies: Use industry-specific examples to extract concrete insights about decision-making behaviors.
✅ Conference Proceedings: Emerging AI applications in decision-making often appear here first.
✅ Executive Memoirs & Interviews: These provide rare insights into the personal strategies of key decision-makers.

Search Keywords for Efficient Targeting
Create search queries that combine:
✅ Decision Context (e.g., “market expansion,” “competitive positioning,” “resource allocation”)
✅ Role/Title (e.g., “business unit leader,” “general manager”)
✅ Strategy Concepts (e.g., “differentiation strategy,” “cost leadership,” “business-level strategy”)
✅ AI-Related Terms (e.g., “AI in decision-making,” “data-driven strategy,” “predictive analytics”)

Here're all the instructions i received for your context. 

## **Step 1: Decision Scenarios for Business-Level Strategy**  
The key challenge here is ensuring each scenario is distinct while remaining practical for Business-Level Strategy. I've emphasized:  
✅ Clear separation from **Crisis Adaptation** scenarios  
✅ Deep dives into **subcategories**, **AI opportunities**, and **decision challenges**  
✅ Relevant **frameworks/models** to ground the insights in established thinking

## ChatGPT (2025-03-13T06:18:56.006799+00:00)

Let's begin by clearly defining your goals and framing thoughtful questions to optimize your prompt for GPT-4o.

**Clarifying Your Objective:**  
You're looking for GPT-4o to perform a deep and targeted online search to collect credible hyperlinks relevant to Step 2 (**Expanded Search Strategy**). The sources should align closely with your boss’s provided instructions, prioritizing recommended journals, reports, case studies, and executive insights.

To ensure accuracy, first consider these clarifying questions:

1. **Scope Precision:**
   - Is the focus equal across all provided scenarios (Market Expansion, Product & Service Positioning, etc.), or are certain scenarios more urgent or prioritized?
   - Do you prefer the search to include all the listed recommended sources (academic, industry, executive memoirs), or focus more heavily on specific types?

2. **Depth & Relevance:**
   - Should the resources emphasize recent publications (e.g., within the last 3–5 years) or include classic theoretical frameworks regardless of age?
   - Is there a preference for resources with real-world applicability (practical tools, actionable guidance) versus those emphasizing theoretical depth?

3. **Quantity & Quality:**
   - Approximately how many resources or hyperlinks would you consider sufficient for initial coverage per scenario?
   - Should GPT-4o include a brief justification for why each hyperlink/resource was selected?

---

**Perspective-Expanding Questions:**  
- Are there specific companies, industries, or regions you're particularly interested in, or should the search remain broad?
- Do you prefer sources that explicitly address AI applications within strategy or broader sources discussing strategic decision-making where AI might be implicitly useful?
- Should GPT-4o highlight specific frameworks or decision-making models explicitly mentioned by your boss, or include alternative frameworks if deemed valuable?

---

Once you address these considerations, here's a structured, optimized prompt ready for GPT-4o:

---

## **Structured Prompt for GPT-4o: Expanded Search Strategy**  

### **Goal & Core Objective:**  
Conduct an extensive and targeted online search to collect credible and high-value hyperlinks aligned explicitly with Step 2 (**Expanded Search Strategy**) as per the provided directive. The search should focus on enriching insights related to strategic decision scenarios, emphasizing academic rigor, industry relevance, and practical applicability.

---

### **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**  
1. **Initial Preparation:**  
   - Thoroughly review provided instructions, scenarios, and recommended sources.
   - Understand the nuances of each scenario (Market Expansion, Product & Service Positioning, Resource Allocation, Competitive Response, Channel & Distribution Strategy, Mergers & Acquisitions).

2. **Craft Search Queries:**  
   - Formulate targeted search strings leveraging provided keywords. Examples:
     - *(“Market expansion” AND “predictive analytics” AND “Strategic Management Journal” OR "McKinsey report")*
     - *(“Competitive response” AND “AI competitor tracking” AND “industry white paper” OR "BCG report")*
   - Utilize Boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) to enhance precision and reduce irrelevant results.

3. **Execute Searches:**  
   - Prioritize recommended sources (Academic Journals, Industry Reports, Case Studies, Executive Memoirs, Conference Proceedings).
   - Systematically execute searches for each scenario, ensuring coverage across decision contexts, AI relevance, and strategy frameworks.

4. **Resource Selection:**  
   - Choose hyperlinks explicitly meeting the criteria: theoretical depth, real-world application, recent trends, clear connection to strategic AI applications, or proven frameworks.
   - Prioritize resources containing comparative analyses, visual decision models, practical recommendations, or demonstrated business impact.

5. **Organize & Justify:**  
   - Clearly organize hyperlinks under each decision scenario (e.g., Market Expansion, Product & Service Positioning, etc.).
   - Provide concise, one-sentence justifications for each hyperlink’s relevance to your boss’s outlined criteria.

---

### **Output Format:**  
Present findings in a structured format like below:

```markdown
## Scenario: Market Expansion
- [Hyperlink 1](URL): Concise justification.
- [Hyperlink 2](URL): Concise justification.

## Scenario: Product & Service Positioning
- [Hyperlink 1](URL): Concise justification.
```

Repeat this structure for all scenarios (Resource Allocation, Competitive Response, Channel & Distribution Strategy, M&A).

---

### **Constraints & Assumptions:**  
- Each scenario should include at least **5–10 highly credible** hyperlinks.
- Ensure each source aligns explicitly with recommended journals, publishers, and examples provided (McKinsey, BCG, Strategic Management Journal, etc.).
- Assume availability of recent publications (within last 5 years), but do not exclude classic seminal papers when significantly influential.

---

### **Context & Background:**  
You're gathering hyperlinks specifically to enhance a business-level strategic decision-making project focusing on AI-enhanced strategy formulation. The final list will directly support senior executive decision-making.

---

### **Persona & Role Assignment:**  
Approach the task as an **expert strategic research analyst** specializing in strategic management and AI applications, focusing on efficiency, precision, and executive-level insightfulness.

---

### **Encouraging Stepwise Thinking:**  
Systematically address each decision scenario, critically evaluate source credibility, explicitly match each hyperlink with specified search strategies, and maintain clarity and conciseness throughout.

Once you provide clarifications or additional considerations, we can further refine this prompt. Let me know your thoughts!

## You (2025-03-13T06:31:34.449000+00:00)

1. Scope precision:
- yes the focus is equal across all provided scenarios. it has to be a very thorough, comprehensive search. 
- focus on all the listed recommended sources. 

2. Depth and Relevance:
- prioritize recent publications for AI related searches, but when it comes to decision making, while i prefer recent searches I don't want to completely exclude heavily cited research as well. Sometimes, some thought models are so ubiquitous that they have been relevant for decades. 
- prioritize real world applicability. 

3. quantity and quality
- i want as many resources as possible, but they have to really be relevant to the questions i shared within the context of step 1. 

- i think a good way is to make sure the output is grouped in categories, and give a brief justification for why the different resources belong to a certain category. 

here's a list of industries and verticals i want to focus on

# Improve Figma prompt

## You (2025-11-12T21:57:09.631000+00:00)

help me improve the following prompt for Figma make.

I've attached three frames, and here's my current prompt.

---
Create a responsive design for the checkout flow screens attached in this Figma file while maintaining the same aesthetic.

Before starting to design,

Think through the current checkout flow which involves 3 steps
1. Enter shipment information
2. Payment Information
3. Review order

in the final step, ensure that the order summary contains the pay now button.

You are designing the mobile view of the same flow. This is a responsive version and not a native app experience. That said, ensure appropriate usability.

## ChatGPT (2025-11-12T21:57:11.186427+00:00)

Thanks for sharing the current prompt and frames. Your goal is clear: redesign the existing **three-step checkout flow** for **mobile**, preserving visual consistency while ensuring responsive usability. The current prompt is solid in intent but can be significantly improved for **precision**, **task scoping**, and **execution clarity**—especially for tools like *Figma Make* where design AI benefits from structured, sequential inputs.

---

Let me offer an improved version of your prompt, with a more **explicit framing of design constraints**, **clear visual hierarchy guidance**, and **step-specific expectations**:

---

### ✅ Revised Figma Make Prompt

**Goal:**
Create a responsive **mobile web design** version of the attached three-step checkout flow while maintaining the same visual style, layout logic, and brand aesthetic as the desktop frames.

**Scope & Flow:**
The mobile design should preserve the following steps:

1. **Shipment Details** – User inputs address and contact information.
2. **Payment Method** – User selects and enters payment method.
3. **Review & Confirm** – User reviews selections and proceeds with final payment.

Each step should be presented as an intuitive and clearly separated screen or card, optimized for **vertical scrolling** on smaller viewports (375px–430px widths).

**Design Requirements & Constraints:**

- This is a **responsive web design**, not a native app. Avoid platform-specific UI conventions (e.g., iOS-only pickers).
- Maintain brand typography, button styles, and iconography.
- Place **"Pay Now"** CTA clearly within the **Order Summary section** on the final step.
- Ensure key inputs and actions (e.g., form fields, buttons, payment method selectors) are easy to tap and legible on mobile screens.
- Avoid cramping: allow proper spacing between elements, especially on form inputs.
- Use accordion, progress bar, or step indicator elements where appropriate to preserve step clarity.

**Mobile UX Priorities:**

- Show step progression (e.g., Step 1 of 3) visually.
- Reduce cognitive load by displaying only the current step’s details.
- Allow back navigation to earlier steps.

---

Would you like me to **further tailor this prompt** for a specific design system, mobile viewport size, accessibility guidance, or a particular Figma Make persona (e.g., minimalist UI, conversion-focused, enterprise checkout UX, etc.)?

## You (2025-11-12T21:58:47.465000+00:00)

The main reason I'm asking Figma Make to work through this is because I'm working through this design myself in Figma, but what's happening is as soon as we reduce the screen size, the order summary panel on the right falls right at the bottom. Now the reality is I don't know a lot about how responsive designs work. I'm wondering if there's some way to keep the web design as is while also making sure that the order summary doesn't become the very last thing that someone sees. I want to make minimal changes to my current web design, but once things shrink, the experience on the mobile gets really wonky and cumbersome. So that's another thing I want to explore through Figma Make.

## ChatGPT (2025-11-12T21:58:49.255029+00:00)

That context is **extremely helpful**—thank you. You're not just asking Figma Make to *recreate* a responsive design, but to **help you *explore a structural UX issue*** that emerges when transitioning from desktop to mobile.

You're dealing with a **layout priority problem** common in responsive checkout flows:
➡️ On desktop, the *Order Summary* panel stays visible (right-hand rail), but in mobile, it collapses to the bottom—creating a delay in user access to pricing, total, and payment action ("Pay Now").

Your core goals are now clearer:

---

### 🔍 Clarified Goals for Figma Make

1. **Explore minimal-change responsive options** that preserve the *desktop layout logic* but adapt cleanly for mobile.
2. **Prevent the Order Summary from becoming invisible or de-prioritized** at the bottom of the mobile flow.
3. **Avoid native-app-style rethinking**—keep this a responsive web UX, not a redesign.
4. You’re looking for **UX layout strategies** (not just pixel shifts) that maintain hierarchy, CTA visibility, and usability.

---

Let’s now rewrite the Figma Make prompt accordingly. This version will make your *intent as a designer* clearer, and direct the tool to offer **layout-smart solutions**, not just a resized version of your desktop design.

---

### ✅ Refined Prompt for Figma Make (Designer-Intent Focused)

**Goal:**
Adapt the attached desktop checkout flow into a responsive **mobile web design**, preserving the current aesthetic and step-based layout with **minimal changes**. This is not a native mobile redesign—focus on adapting the existing design responsively.

**Key Design Challenge:**
On desktop, the **Order Summary** panel remains visible on the right. However, in responsive views, it collapses below all other steps—making it the last thing a user sees. This reduces visibility of the **"Pay Now"** action and breaks the expected checkout flow.

**What I need you to do:**

- Explore layout strategies that **prioritize the Order Summary**, especially the **Total** and **Pay Now** CTA, *without rethinking the whole page*.
- Suggest responsive design patterns (e.g., **sticky summary card**, **collapsible preview**, **floating CTA bar**, etc.) that solve this UX issue **within the existing visual structure**.
- Maintain the 3-step logic:
  1. Enter Shipping Info
  2. Enter Payment Info
  3. Review Order (with Pay Now)

**Responsive Design Constraints:**

- This is a **responsive web design**, not a native app UI.
- Maintain the brand’s visual consistency: typography, padding, button styles, etc.
- Mobile widths to optimize for: 375px – 430px.
- Inputs and actions must remain accessible and touch-friendly.

**Success Criteria:**

- The **Order Summary** remains accessible and visible as needed throughout checkout.
- The **Pay Now button** should never feel hidden or unreachable.
- Each step should remain distinct and easy to complete on smaller screens.

---

Would you like me to generate **a visual layout strategy** or **annotated Figma layout principles** that you can test yourself alongside what Figma Make produces?

## You (2025-11-12T21:59:57.189000+00:00)

Yeah, but I like this prompt, but there's an implicit bias here to over-prioritize the order summary. The reality is I just want to make sure that the end design follows some usability standards, in the sense that the user knows how to navigate through the experience. They're not left wondering where certain things are. So that's the overall idea.

## ChatGPT (2025-11-12T21:59:58.205461+00:00)

Got it. You're not trying to force the **Order Summary** into top visibility at all costs—you're trying to make sure the **entire flow remains intuitive, discoverable, and usable**, *especially when compressed to a smaller viewport*. Your concern is with **usability hierarchy**, not visibility prioritization.

That’s a key clarification, so let’s revise the Figma Make prompt to reflect this shift:

- Drop the overemphasis on “Order Summary visibility.”
- Emphasize **progressive disclosure**, **step clarity**, and **predictable navigation**.
- Ask Figma Make to suggest **lightweight layout adaptations** that preserve the logic and aesthetics while restoring usability at small sizes.

---

### ✅ Final Prompt for Figma Make (Usability-Focused)

**Goal:**
Adapt the attached desktop checkout flow into a responsive **mobile web design**, preserving the existing visual style and structure with **minimal layout changes**. This is not a native app experience—focus on responsive adaptation of the web UI.

**Design Intent:**
Ensure that the 3-step checkout flow remains **usable, intuitive, and discoverable** when viewed on smaller screens (375–430px widths). Users should clearly understand:

1. What step they are in
2. What’s required to complete that step
3. How to move forward or return
4. Where to find the final action ("Pay Now")

**Design Challenges to Address:**

- On mobile, some panels (e.g. Order Summary) shift downward in the flow, which may delay or obscure key information or actions.
- The current desktop layout uses side-by-side content. On mobile, this stacks vertically, which can make certain sections feel hidden or disconnected.

**What I’d like from you:**

- Suggest **mobile-friendly layout strategies** (e.g., step indicators, sticky headers/footers, collapsible panels, section previews) that maintain logical flow and help users stay oriented.
- Preserve the brand’s visual identity—colors, buttons, typography—while ensuring touch usability and readability.
- Do not radically rethink the layout or interaction model. Keep the changes **lightweight and structurally consistent** with the desktop version.

**Success Criteria:**

- The entire flow remains easy to navigate and complete on small screens.
- Users are never left unsure about where they are or what to do next.
- The “Pay Now” action appears in a logical and expected place during the final step, without needing to hunt for it.

---

Would you also like a quick **heuristic checklist** or annotated guidance for evaluating the mobile usability of the design yourself, as a non-expert in responsive systems? I can give you that as a side reference while you iterate in Figma.

## You (2025-11-12T22:05:23.383000+00:00)

After thoroughly reviewing the design, I have a few inquiries regarding its feasibility from a technical standpoint. Although I don't possess extensive engineering expertise, I’m trying to grasp whether the proposed responsive layout can realistically be implemented as outlined. Specifically, I'm curious about the functionality where the progress indicators transition from a left-aligned position on the desktop layout to a top-aligned position on mobile devices.

Additionally, I’ve noticed that the order summary panel, which is not designed to be expandable or collapsible in the web version, is proposed to function as an expandable component on mobile. This shift in functionality raises questions about the practicality of such changes.

Could you provide insight into whether these features can realistically be developed? If they cannot be implemented as designed, I would appreciate guidance on what specific instructions or adjustments I should communicate to the Figma team for a more feasible approach. This way, we can ensure that the design aligns well with technical capabilities while still maintaining the intended user experience.

## ChatGPT (2025-11-12T22:05:25.199364+00:00)

Your questions show a very sharp eye for **design-to-development alignment**—which is often where responsive web designs break down. Let’s break this down carefully to address your two main areas of concern:

---

## 🔧 1. Feasibility of Responsive **Progress Indicator Layout Shift**

### 📌 Summary of the Change
You're referring to the transition where the **horizontal progress tracker** on desktop (typically left-aligned or top-of-page in a sidebar layout) becomes **centered and stacked at the top** on mobile.

### ✅ Feasibility: Yes, 100% implementable

This is a **common, well-supported responsive pattern**, and front-end developers handle this by using:

- **Flexbox/Grid with media queries**
- Conditional layout classes (e.g., using Tailwind, Bootstrap, or custom CSS)
- `@media (max-width: 768px)` CSS to:
  - Center-align progress items
  - Stack or compress labels/icons
  - Hide or truncate labels if needed for small screens

✅ **No structural redesign or JS is required.** It’s a pure CSS/layout shift.

### 🔧 What to Communicate to Figma/Design Team:
> Ensure the progress indicator component is designed to be **layout-flexible**, with clear stacking rules defined for narrow viewports. Icons, labels, and spacing should gracefully compress or wrap without needing component redesign.

---

## 🔧 2. Feasibility of Making the **Order Summary Panel Collapsible on Mobile**

### 📌 Summary of the Change
In the desktop version, the **Order Summary** is static and always visible (in the right-hand rail). On mobile, due to space constraints, you’ve proposed making it a **collapsible/expandable section** (with something like an accordion).

### 🟡 Feasibility: Yes, but this *is* a **functional change**, not just a responsive layout tweak.

This means:

- Developers need to **add new interaction logic** (typically via JavaScript/React/Vue or whatever framework is in use).
- It requires **component state management** (expanded/collapsed).
- Accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation) needs to be handled properly for it to meet web standards.
- Animation (e.g., smooth slide toggle) might also be expected.

This is a **moderate-lift but standard feature**—very feasible if your team is using a modern web stack.

---

### 🔧 What to Communicate to Figma/Design Team:

> On mobile, propose the Order Summary as a **collapsible component**, but clearly flag it as a **new interactive behavior**, not just a layout adaptation. Ensure that:
> - The default state (expanded or collapsed) is defined.
> - The trigger (chevron, “View Summary,” etc.) is accessible and intuitive.
> - The animation is optional, but spacing should be smooth and non-jarring when toggled.
> - The CTA (“Pay Now” or “Continue”) should never be hidden inside the collapsed panel if it’s the final step action.

---

## 🧠 Suggested Design Notes You Can Include in Figma or Specs

To help your engineering partners (and Figma Make or your design team), consider attaching the following as **notes or constraints**:

---

### ✅ Responsive Progress Indicator
- **Desktop Layout**: Left-anchored progress bar or top-of-form tracker
- **Mobile Layout**: Centered horizontal stack
- Use flex or grid to allow wrap and alignment shift via `@media` rules
- Avoid text truncation unless labels are too long for <360px viewports

### ✅ Order Summary on Mobile
- Desktop: Fixed, always-visible side panel
- Mobile: Convert to collapsible section
- Behavior:
  - Default state: Collapsed or expanded (choose based on usability testing)
  - Header tap toggles visibility
  - Summary content slides in/out
- Dev notes:
  - Needs state management
  - Should retain visible "Total" or CTA outside collapsed content if user flow depends on it

---

### 🛠 If You Want a Simpler Alternative
If your team has limited engineering capacity or is working with a CMS/low-code platform:

- Instead of full collapse/expand, consider a **“sticky footer” CTA** (e.g., always showing “$1600 – Continue” at bottom), and allow full Order Summary to appear only on the final step.
- This approach simplifies dev and maintains the user’s sense of cost & next step without introducing interaction complexity.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Feature | Feasibility | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Progress indicator layout shift | ✅ Easy | Pure CSS/Flexbox; no new functionality needed |
| Collapsible order summary on mobile | 🟡 Moderate | Requires JS or component logic; standard practice, but must be flagged as functional shift |

---

Would you like a **template handoff note** or visual annotation guideline you can include in your Figma file for engineers or Figma Make prompts? It can ensure dev/design alignment and reduce ambiguity around what's a layout shift vs. a behavior change.

## You (2025-11-12T22:08:14.852000+00:00)

Please evaluate the screenshot I shared with you, which showcases the mobile view created by Figma Make, in comparison to the original Figma frames I provided at the top. The first three frames I shared represent the existing web version. I would like you to assess the technical feasibility of the responsive behavior for the components. Based on your analysis, please also draft a follow-up prompt I can use in Figma Make to implement the necessary adjustments.





## ChatGPT (2025-11-12T22:08:35.912532+00:00)

Short answer:
Yes, everything in that Figma Make mobile mock **can** be built—but a couple of bits are *not* “just responsive behavior,” they’re **new interactions** that you’ll want to be explicit about.

---

## 1. Technically, is this responsive layout feasible?

### a) Progress indicator (now at the top)

- **Desktop:** numbered steps down the left side (1 Shipment, 2 Payment, 3 Review).
- **Mobile screenshot:** a 4-step horizontal tracker at the top (Account, Shipment, Payment, Review).

**Feasibility:**
Totally fine. This is a classic flexbox/grid + media query job:

- Desktop: show the vertical numbered list.
- Mobile: switch to a horizontal stepper at the top (centered icons + labels).

The only thing to call out is:
- The **step count changed from 3 to 4** (Account is now its own step). That’s a *flow change*, not just layout. Engineering can still build it, but product/design should agree whether it’s really 3 or 4 steps.

---

### b) Main content stacking (Account → Shipment → Payment)

These just move from two-column desktop to a single vertical column in mobile:

- Account details card
- Shipment details card (with “Edit”)
- Payment form

**Feasibility:**
Very standard responsive behavior. Implemented with:

- CSS grid or flexbox that collapses from 2 columns → 1 column at mobile breakpoints.
- No special logic required.

No technical red flags here.

---

### c) Sticky bottom “Order Total + CTA” bar (expandable)

In the mobile screenshot you now have:

- A **sticky bar at the bottom** showing
  `Order Total: $1,600.00` + chevron
- A large “Continue to Next Step” button
- The chevron implies the bar can **expand/collapse into a full order summary**.

On desktop, the order summary is:

- A **fixed side panel**, not collapsible.
- Contains promo code, line items, tax, and the final Pay Now button.

**Feasibility:**
Also doable, but this is a real **behavior change**, not just layout:

- Needs JS/component state to handle expand/collapse.
- Needs “sticky” positioning logic (and care around:
  - Mobile keyboards (so it doesn’t cover form fields)
  - Safe-area insets (on iPhones with notches / rounded corners)
  - Accessibility (aria-expanded, focus order, etc.)

It’s still **well within normal web patterns**. Just make sure everyone treats it as a new component (“mobile summary bottom sheet”), not as a free side effect of responsiveness.

Also: on the final step, the CTA text and placement should align with desktop:

- Desktop final step: **“Pay Now”** in the Order Summary pane.
- Mobile final step: your sticky CTA should probably become **“Pay Now”** as well.

---

## 2. What I’d clarify / adjust in the design (from a feasibility lens)

1. **Decide on step count and consistency**
   - Is the flow officially **3 steps** (Shipment, Payment, Review) or **4** (Account, Shipment, Payment, Review)?
   - Whatever you pick, keep labels and steps consistent across desktop and mobile.

2. **Specify the order summary behavior clearly**
   - Default state on each step (collapsed vs expanded).
   - Where the **primary CTA** lives on each step:
     - Payment step: “Continue to Review” or similar.
     - Review step: “Pay Now”.
   - When the bar expands, does the button stay visible at the bottom of the sheet?

3. **Keep the data identical between desktop and mobile**
   - The expanded mobile order summary should show the **same information** as the desktop panel: promo code, items, subtotal, tax, total, etc.

---

## 3. Follow-up prompt you can use in Figma Make

Here’s a prompt you can paste directly into Figma Make:

---

**Prompt for Figma Make**

I’m refining the responsive mobile version of the checkout flow based on the original desktop Figma frames (3-step checkout with Account details, Shipment details, Payment, and an Order Summary panel on the right).

Please keep the overall visual style the same, but adjust the mobile design so that the responsive behavior is realistic to implement on the web, with minimal additional complexity.

**1. Progress indicator**

- On desktop, the flow is represented with steps along the left side.
- On mobile, keep a top progress indicator, but design it as a simple horizontal stepper that could be built with flexbox and media queries.
- Make sure the **number of steps and their labels match the desktop flow** (3 steps vs 4 steps should be consistent across both).

**2. Layout reflow**

- The main sections (Account details, Shipment details, Payment) should simply stack vertically on mobile.
- Design this so it can be achieved by collapsing the desktop 2-column layout into a 1-column layout using CSS grid/flexbox, without needing a totally different structure.

**3. Order Summary on mobile**

- On desktop, the Order Summary is a fixed right-hand panel with promo code, line items, tax, and total.
- On mobile, keep the **same information**, but present it as:
  - A **sticky bottom bar** that always shows the order total and the primary action button for the current step, and
  - An optional expandable section/sheet that reveals the full order summary details.
- Clearly show:
  - The default state on each step (e.g., collapsed with total only).
  - How the user expands and collapses the summary (e.g., tap on the bar or chevron).
  - Where the primary CTA lives:
    - On intermediate steps, something like “Continue to Next Step”.
    - On the final review step, the label should be **“Pay Now”** to match the desktop design.

**4. Implementation-friendly constraints**

- Avoid introducing complex, app-like behavior; keep interactions limited to simple web patterns (sticky footer bar, accordion/expandable panel, basic transitions).
- Make sure the sticky footer and expanded summary do not cover essential form fields, and leave room for the mobile keyboard.
- Keep typography, spacing, and buttons touch-friendly and consistent with the desktop style.

The goal is a mobile layout that feels natural and easy to navigate, while staying as close as possible to the existing desktop structure and realistic for front-end engineers to build.

---

If you’d like, I can also help you write a short dev handoff note explaining *exactly* how the sticky order summary should behave (states, breakpoints, and ARIA attributes) so engineering doesn’t have to guess.

## You (2025-11-12T22:10:55.432000+00:00)

Evaluate the instructions you've given as a front-end developer. Right now, your instructions are making design recommendations for Figma Make, but I want you to evaluate all these instructions as a front-end developer and see if you are potentially disrupting engineering work by these designs.





## ChatGPT (2025-11-12T22:11:09.838959+00:00)

You’re absolutely right to ask this, and yeah—some of what I suggested *does* add engineering weight. Let me put on a pure front-end-developer hat and critique my own directions.

---

## 1. What’s cheap vs. disruptive from an engineering POV?

### A. Step indicator moving to the top (desktop → mobile)

**What I asked for:**
- Desktop: steps on the left.
- Mobile: horizontal stepper at the top, consistent labels/count.

**Dev impact:**
- Pure CSS (flex/grid + media queries).
- No new logic as long as:
  - Step count doesn’t change.
  - It’s the same component, just styled differently at small breakpoints.

✅ **Verdict:** Very safe. This is standard responsive behavior and not disruptive **if** we keep step count and flow the same.

⚠️ Potential disruption:
- If design treats “Account” as a *new* step (so desktop had 3, mobile shows 4), that **does** affect routing / validation / analytics. That’s product & implementation work, not just CSS.

**Developer-friendly tweak:**
Keep the **exact same number and names of steps** on desktop and mobile. Only change alignment and visual style.

---

### B. Desktop 2-column → mobile 1-column stacking

**What I asked for:**
- “Just stack Account, Shipment, Payment vertically on mobile.”

**Dev impact:**
- Straightforward: change CSS from `display:grid`/two columns to single column at, say, 768px.
- No changes to data model, routes, or logic.

✅ **Verdict:** Totally fine. This is the kind of thing devs expect and usually already have a pattern for.

---

### C. Sticky bottom bar + expandable order summary

This is the big one.

**What I asked for:**
- A sticky bottom bar that always shows:
  - Order total
  - Primary CTA (“Continue” / “Pay Now”)
- The bar acts as a trigger to expand a full order summary (like a mini bottom sheet).

**Dev impact:**

This is **absolutely buildable**, but it is **not** a “free” responsive tweak:

1. **New behavior & state**
   - Need JS/component logic to track “expanded vs collapsed.”
   - Need ARIA attributes & focus handling for accessibility.
   - Need animations / height transitions done carefully.

2. **Sticky positioning complexities**
   - Must coexist with:
     - Mobile browser chrome (Safari/Chrome toolbars that appear/disappear)
     - On-screen keyboard (avoid covering form fields)
     - Existing footer, if any.
   - Often requires layout refactoring (e.g., ensuring the main content area has bottom padding equal to the sticky bar height).

3. **CTA refactor**
   - On desktop, the primary CTA lives in the right rail.
   - On mobile, I put it into the sticky bar.
   - That usually means:
     - Updating templates so there is a single “source of truth” for the CTA, not two hard-coded locations.
     - Checking all validation/submission flows still work when triggered from this new place.

4. **QA surface area**
   - You now have to test:
     - Multiple breakpoints
     - Expand/collapse behavior
     - Keyboard cases
     - Screen readers
   - That’s more than “just make the page shrink nicely.”

🟡 **Verdict:** Feasible, but **definitely disruptive** compared to pure CSS responsiveness. This is a small feature in isolation, but on a production checkout, it’s non-trivial.

If your goal is “minimal engineering disruption,” a sticky + expandable bottom bar is at least a **medium-sized** change.

---

## 2. Where my previous instructions *over-reach* from a dev perspective

Here’s where I, as a dev, would push back or ask for simplification:

1. **Sticky + expandable order summary as the *default* pattern**
   - That implies JS state, layout refactors, and more QA.
   - Might be overkill if your main goal is simply: “don’t bury the order summary.”

2. **Implied step re-architecture**
   - Mentioning 4 steps in one place, 3 in another can easily translate into “we’re changing the flow,” which may touch back-end routing, tracking, etc.

3. **Precision of CTA behavior across steps**
   - Having different CTA labels and possibly locations per step is fine, but it means tighter integration with the existing checkout logic. Not impossible, just more coordination.

---

## 3. A more “developer-friendly” design brief you can give Figma Make

If you want to **reduce disruption** while still improving the mobile UX, I’d soften the requirements like this:

### Core principle for the prompt
> Prefer **CSS-only layout changes** first. Any new interactive behavior (sticky bars, expand/collapse) should be treated as **optional enhancements**, not mandatory.

Here’s a revised prompt written with that in mind:

---

### ✅ Developer-friendly Figma Make Prompt

I’m adapting our existing desktop checkout (3-step flow with an Order Summary panel on the right) for mobile. I want the mobile design to be **realistic to implement with minimal engineering changes**, favoring CSS-only responsiveness where possible.

**1. Steps / Progress Indicator**

- Keep the **same number of steps and labels** as the desktop flow.
- On mobile, it’s fine to move the progress indicator to the top and center it, but this should be achievable with CSS (flex/grid + media queries), not with new logic or an extra step.

**2. Layout Reflow**

- For mobile, the main sections (Account, Shipment, Payment, Review) should simply **stack vertically** in a single column.
- Design this so it can be implemented by changing layout at a breakpoint (no new pages, no splitting existing steps).

**3. Order Summary on Mobile (Keep it Simple First)**

- The **same Order Summary content** from desktop should appear in the mobile flow, but we should prioritize solutions that don’t require complex new behavior.
- Preferred baseline pattern:
  - Show the Order Summary as a regular card **near the bottom of the page**, above the main CTA.
  - It can be a simple static block that scrolls with the page.
- Optional enhancement (only if it doesn’t over-complicate implementation):
  - You may explore a **simple collapsible variant** of the Order Summary (accordion-style), but it does **not** need to be sticky to the bottom of the viewport.
  - If you show this, treat the sticky/expandable version as an optional concept, not the required final answer.

**4. Primary CTA Behavior**

- The primary CTA (“Continue” / “Pay Now”) should:
  - Stay in a **predictable, consistent place** on both desktop and mobile.
  - Ideally be rendered as part of the main form area rather than introducing a new sticky footer bar, unless absolutely necessary.
- It’s okay if mobile uses a full-width button that appears under the order summary card.

**5. General Constraints**

- No major changes to the checkout flow, routing, or step logic.
- Avoid patterns that require complex JavaScript interactions like bottom sheets or advanced sticky behaviors.
- Focus on clear visual hierarchy, spacing, and readability so the user isn’t confused about where they are or what to do next.

The goal: a mobile layout that feels intuitive and usable, but could realistically be implemented by mostly adjusting CSS and templates, without a large front-end refactor.

---

If you want, I can also give you a tiny “engineering comment” you can paste into the Figma file so devs know that sticky/expandable summaries are considered **nice-to-have**, not **must-have** features.

## You (2025-11-12T22:29:27.677000+00:00)

Could you write a set of instructions for executing frames in code using Figma Make? I want to see a functional flow without needing to create an entire prototype. It's important that the output maintains accuracy with the current design in every detail, as I've noticed that the outputs from Figma Make are often inconsistent with the Figma frames, even though it includes all the necessary elements.





## ChatGPT (2025-11-12T22:29:52.237553+00:00)

You can absolutely nudge Figma Make into “implementation mode” instead of “creative redesign mode”—you just have to be very explicit that you want **code-level execution of the existing frames**, not reinterpretation.

Below is a prompt you can paste into Figma Make that’s tuned for:

- **Pixel/visual fidelity** to your current frames
- A **simple, functional flow** (step-to-step navigation)
- **Minimal extra behavior** so you don’t accidentally create new engineering work

---

### Prompt for Figma Make — “Execute These Frames in Code”

I want you to translate my existing checkout frames into a **functional coded flow**, not redesign them.

**Overall goal**

- Use the existing Figma frames as the **single source of truth**.
- Produce a working flow (HTML/CSS/JS or React) that matches the visual design and layout **as closely as possible**, and wires up the basic navigation between steps.

**Mode: replication, not interpretation**

When in doubt, **copy exactly** rather than “improve”:

- Do **not** change colors, typography, spacing, border radius, or iconography.
- Do **not** rename labels, buttons, or steps.
- Do **not** introduce new layouts, additional panels, sticky bars, or collapsible behavior that does not already exist in the frame.
- Do **not** add new states or animations unless they are clearly implied in the frame (e.g., hover state shown separately).

If something is unclear in the design, keep the implementation **simple and conservative** (e.g., static instead of interactive).

**Frames to execute**

Use the original desktop frames as the reference for visual and structural details:

1. Shipment / address entry step
2. Payment step
3. Review / confirmation step with order summary and Pay Now

Treat each of these frames as a **screen** in a linear flow.

**Functional behavior required**

- Implement **only the happy-path navigation** between steps:
  - Clicking the primary button in step 1 moves to step 2.
  - Clicking the primary button in step 2 moves to step 3.
  - On the final step, the primary button triggers a placeholder “Payment submitted” action (e.g., console log or simple message).
- If a frame includes “Edit” links (e.g., Edit Shipment), these may simply navigate back to the appropriate earlier frame; they do not need complex inline editing.
- Form fields do not need real validation logic beyond basic HTML types; the focus is on layout and structure, not full business rules.

**Visual accuracy requirements**

Match the Figma frames as if you were hand-coding a production UI:

- Match **font family, size, weight, and line-height**.
- Match **spacing**: padding, margins, gaps between sections, and card shadows.
- Match **widths** and **alignment** of form fields, labels, and buttons.
- Preserve the **order and grouping** of elements exactly as in the frames (e.g., Account Details card above Shipment Details card, then Payment).
- Keep the **Order Summary** in the same position and structure as the desktop design; do not turn it into a sticky bar or collapsible component.

If you need to adjust anything for technical reasons (e.g., a tiny spacing difference), keep changes minimal and maintain the visual intent.

**Code / structure expectations**

- Use semantic HTML structure (sections, headings, form, inputs, buttons) where possible.
- Keep the code organized so that each screen/step is clearly separated (e.g., separate components or clearly named sections).
- Use straightforward CSS or a simple utility system; avoid framework-specific magic that makes the layout differ from what’s in the Figma frames.

**Output**

- Generate the code for the full 3-step flow with navigation between steps.
- Ensure the rendered result would look **nearly identical** to the original Figma frames at desktop width.
- Do not add additional screen sizes or responsive behavior in this pass; focus only on faithfully executing the current frames in code.

If you’d like, I can also make a second version of this prompt that *only* adds mobile responsiveness on top of this “pixel-perfect desktop execution,” so you can keep those two tasks clearly separated for both Figma Make and your engineers.

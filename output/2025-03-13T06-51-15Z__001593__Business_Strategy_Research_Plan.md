# Business Strategy Research Plan

## You (2025-03-13T06:51:15.669573+00:00)

Hey Elliot, could you help me build an o3 prompt?

I am conducting a comprehensive research project focused on Business-Level Strategy. The goal is to gather a broad yet relevant collection of resources that explore:


Decision-Making Frameworks and Models used by Business Unit Leaders, General Managers, and Senior Directors.

The role of AI-driven tools and insights in enhancing strategic decision-making processes.

Real-world examples, case studies, and best practices that demonstrate the successful (or unsuccessful) application of these strategies.


Scope of Research

✅ Conduct a thorough investigation into six key Business-Level Strategy decision scenarios:


Market Expansion – Decisions around entering new markets, forming partnerships, and digital expansion.

Product & Service Positioning – Decisions related to product differentiation, feature prioritization, and roadmap strategy.

Resource Allocation – Decisions about budget optimization, talent deployment, and investment trade-offs.

Competitive Response – Decisions made in response to competitor moves, industry disruption, or pricing strategy.

Channel & Distribution Strategy – Decisions regarding sales channels, partner ecosystems, and inventory optimization.

Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) – Decisions around target selection, due diligence, and post-merger integration.

✅ For each scenario, the search should focus on:


Key Decision Criteria – What factors influence decision-making in this scenario?

Frameworks and Models – Established mental models, strategy frameworks, or decision-making theories that guide these choices.

AI Integration – The role of AI tools (e.g., predictive analytics, NLP tools, machine learning models) in improving decision outcomes.

Common Pain Points and Cognitive Biases – Unique challenges executives face in these decision contexts.


Source Prioritization

The search must prioritize the following sources, ensuring the most credible and impactful resources are collected:

✅ Academic Journals — Prioritize well-cited, foundational research for strategy frameworks (even if older), but lean toward recent research for AI advancements.


Recommended journals include: Strategic Management Journal, Harvard Business Review, MIT Sloan Management Review, California Management Review.

✅ Industry Reports & White Papers — Focus on recent insights from leading consulting firms that reflect current trends, AI applications, and practical decision frameworks.


Recommended sources: McKinsey, BCG, Gartner, Forrester, Deloitte Insights.

✅ Conference Proceedings — Search for AI-focused content in conferences known for emerging trends.


Recommended conferences: NeurIPS (AI-focused), INFORMS (Decision Science), and AAAI Conference Papers.

✅ Case Studies — Seek detailed, real-world examples where companies implemented strategic decisions.


Prioritize cases that demonstrate decision frameworks in action or reveal the role of AI in strategy.

✅ Executive Memoirs & Insights — Include insights from influential business leaders, particularly those reflecting on real-world strategic decisions.


Examples: Satya Nadella’s “Hit Refresh”, Ben Horowitz’s “The Hard Thing About Hard Things”.


Critical Consideration:

DO NOT refer to blogposts. if your sources are web based, make sure you stick to the list I've shared with you. other than that, books and research publications can come from different places.


Search Criteria & Precision

To ensure maximum relevance, apply the following criteria:

✅ Date Range:


For AI-driven insights, prioritize publications from 2019 onward to reflect the latest developments.

For decision-making frameworks, include older foundational models if they are widely cited or still relevant in practice.

✅ Search Keywords: Combine decision scenario terms with AI-related terminology for highly targeted searches. Examples include:


(“Market expansion” AND “risk assessment” AND “AI forecasting”)

(“Product positioning” AND “AI-enhanced testing” AND “customer sentiment analysis”)

(“Resource allocation” AND “AI optimization” AND “budget strategy”)

(“Competitive response” AND “machine learning” AND “market shifts”)

(“M&A strategy” AND “AI valuation models” AND “post-merger integration”)

✅ Boolean Operators: Use combinations of AND, OR, and NOT to refine search precision.

✅ Resource Screening: Prioritize content that includes:


Clear frameworks or structured decision-making models

Case studies or examples with actionable insights

Comparative studies that evaluate multiple strategic models

Visual frameworks that simplify complex concepts


Key Reminders:

Emphasize real-world relevance — Prioritize resources that offer clear, practical insights over abstract or theoretical discussions.

Prioritize AI integration insights — Particularly where AI augments strategic decision-making (e.g., predictive models, NLP analysis, etc.).

Balance depth and breadth — The search should aim for maximum coverage across all six scenarios while ensuring each is treated distinctly.

Highlight influential thought models — Even if older, prioritize landmark frameworks that remain foundational in strategic thinking.

Provide ample variety — Include diverse perspectives from different industries, markets, and organizational structures.


Success Criteria

The final output should contain:

✅ Minimum of 8–10 highly relevant resources per decision scenario.

✅ Each entry must include a hyperlink, brief description, and justification for inclusion.

✅ A well-structured result with categories reflecting the six decision scenarios.

✅ A mix of AI-specific content, strategy frameworks, and real-world examples to ensure the insights are applicable.

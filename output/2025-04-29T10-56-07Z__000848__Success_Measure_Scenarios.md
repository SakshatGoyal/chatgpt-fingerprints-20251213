# Success Measure Scenarios

## You (2025-04-29T10:56:07.493399+00:00)

🧠 Overall Goal:

Transform abstract success measures into relatable, vivid mini-scenarios that stakeholders can see, feel, and recognize as credible — especially in ambiguous or high-change environments.

⸻

🔧 Structural Framework to Follow (Every Time):

Each response should follow this exact structure:

⸻

1. Scenario Overview (2–3 sentences)

Goal: Ground the reader in a specific context — what’s happening in the org, what tension is unfolding. This is the emotional and strategic stage-setter.
	•	Do make it time-bound and clear: “In 2029, X company…”
	•	Do include the real stakes or shift: “Leadership realizes…”
	•	Don’t restate the people problem or just paraphrase the original scenario blandly.
	•	Tone: Calm, confident, lightly narrative.

⸻

2. Success Measures and Manifestations

For each success measure, copy the original wording exactly (as the bold header), then follow it with a mini-scene showing what this looks like when it actually happens inside an organization.

Format:

[Original success measure]

(Mini-scene that shows this playing out — not as a general trend, but as a specific, vivid, grounded example.)

	•	Each mini-scene is 1–2 short paragraphs. It should feel lived, specific, and organizationally plausible.
	•	Use vivid anchors: Internal meeting names, roles (“VP of Strategy,” “Chief Trust Officer”), workplace rituals, language shifts, real tensions.
	•	Avoid mechanical rewording. Show people wrestling, deciding, or reframing — not just adopting a framework by name.

⸻

🔍 Creative Judgment Process:

Here’s the thinking model used behind the scenes:

⸻

✅ DO:
	•	Preserve original success measure wording exactly. It’s a contract — don’t paraphrase.
	•	Map the success measure into a specific, human organizational scene.
	•	Ask: If this measure were true, what would I hear in a meeting? Who would say it? How would it land?
	•	Add details naturally: team reviews, retros, friction points, language evolution, trade-off decisions.
	•	Surface contradiction if helpful: what used to happen, what changed, what catalyzed the shift.
	•	Use internal language realistically: teams don’t say “scalable personalization,” they say “we need to stop duct-taping exceptions.”

⸻

❌ DON’T:
	•	❌ Don’t paraphrase or generalize the success measure.
	•	Wrong: “The team got better at testing dissent.”
	•	Right: “They created a ‘red-team ritual’ before gate reviews.”
	•	❌ Don’t rely on abstract success (“things got better”). Always show what changed and how.
	•	❌ Don’t write academic tone. This is strategic narrative, not a white paper.
	•	❌ Don’t invent sci-fi mechanics. Stay grounded in realistic workplace dynamics.

⸻

✨ Tone and Style Guidelines:
	•	Organizational Realism > Theoretical Cleanliness
It should feel like something a sharp mid-level or senior operator would read and say: “Yeah, this actually happens.”
	•	Warm, Composed, Human-Strategic
Think Sheryl Sandberg’s public tone: confident, empathetic, systemic.
	•	Causal > Descriptive
Prioritize “What changed because of this?” over just “What is.”

⸻

🧭 Checklist to Run for Each Scenario:
	1.	Am I clear on the scenario’s tension?
	•	What human misalignment or organizational friction is driving the need for change?
	2.	Do I understand the success measures and what they imply?
	•	What is this success measure really trying to signal? A mindset shift? A behavior? A structure?
	3.	Can I imagine a meeting, a sentence, or a role that would signal that success?
	•	Use that as your core narrative device.
	4.	Did I keep the structure: Scenario Overview → Each Success Measure → Mini-scene?
	•	This structure anchors the story while allowing freedom in tone.
	5.	Did I avoid buzzwords, abstract summaries, or idealized behavior?
	•	If it sounds like a brochure, rewrite it.

⸻

🧰 Sample Language Cues to Use:

INTENT	PHRASE EXAMPLES
Showing evolved language	“You now hear phrases like…” “One manager reframes it as…”
Signaling mindshift	“Instead of X, they now ask Y…”
Showing process change	“Before any rollout, the team now runs…”
Framing resistance	“The pushback wasn’t about cost — it was about identity.”
Postmortem tone	“The tone in the review wasn’t failure. It was calibration.”

Absolutely — I’m ready to apply this format. Please share the **original success measures** you want translated into mini-scenarios, and, if helpful, a brief description of the **organizational tension** or context (e.g., post-merger, scaling pains, new AI initiative, etc.).

Would you like to start with a specific scenario, or send over multiple success measures at once?

## You (2025-04-29T10:57:33.263656+00:00)

Scenario: After the consultancy's departure, post-cloud migration, engineering teams struggle with an unfamiliar architecture. Initial cost savings give way to mounting expenses and technical debt, revealing that rapid implementation without internal expertise creates instability rather than strength. The focus shifts to rebuilding in-house capabilities.

---

## **What ‘people problem’ are we trying to solve?**

**To move faster and cut costs, executives increasingly default to external partnerships — often at the expense of internal innovation. This short-term gain masks a deeper erosion of capability, confidence, and long-term strategic resilience.**

## **How do we know this is a problem?**

Empirical data shows 89% of banking executives prefer outsourcing to internal development. While partnerships offer speed, they often sideline internal teams, weakening core innovation capabilities over time. Post-engagement reviews reveal gaps in tech literacy, decreased autonomy, and diminished investment in internal growth — signaling that external solutions are displacing, rather than reinforcing, organizational learning.

## **How might we know if we’ve solved this problem?**

### Build vs. buy tradeoffs are reframed as capability design decisions, not just financial ones.

In strategic planning sessions, you hear questions like, “What muscle are we choosing to grow here?” or “Are we outsourcing the problem or the learning?”.

In high-velocity contexts, when asked why a partnership was chosen, we see a reduction in responses like “speed” or “cost,” and we see them describing what the company intentionally chose not to develop internally — and why.

The clarity of these tradeoffs, even in compressed timelines, is a sign that capability thinking has become internalized, not just aspirational.

### Innovation retros and reviews prioritize capability transfer, not just outcome metrics.

Post-launch discussions explicitly surface what was learned, codified, or upskilled internally.

Teams ask, “What can we now do ourselves that we couldn’t before?” — indicating that partnerships are vehicles for evolution, not dependency.

### 1. **Scenario Overview**  
In early 2025, a global fintech firm completes a high-stakes cloud migration with the help of an external consultancy. The executive team celebrates early cost savings, but within months, engineering velocity slows, outages spike, and internal teams escalate frustration: they can’t debug what they don’t understand. Leadership realizes they didn’t just outsource infrastructure — they outsourced their ability to evolve. The new mandate: rebuild from within, with capability as the compass.

⸻  
### 2. **Success Measures and Manifestations**

**Build vs. buy tradeoffs are reframed as capability design decisions, not just financial ones.**  

During the Q2 Strategy Alignment offsite, the VP of Engineering interrupts a slide framing a new vendor proposal as “40% cheaper and 2x faster.” She asks: “But are we renting speed or building muscle?” The room pauses. The CFO, initially skeptical, reframes the next decision doc to include a new section: *‘Core Capability Impact’*. From then on, every partnership review includes a deliberate inventory of what skills are being outsourced, and why.  

Two months later, in a platform team’s sprint review, a lead engineer reflects: “We turned down that DevOps automation tool — not because it wasn’t good, but because we decided we need to own how our infra scales.” These conversations don’t slow decisions; they sharpen them. Teams move with clarity on what *not* to offload — and that clarity becomes a cultural muscle.

**Innovation retros and reviews prioritize capability transfer, not just outcome metrics.**  

In a post-mortem for the new payments routing layer, the lead architect kicks off not with NPS or SLA stats, but with a prompt: “What can we now design without calling in a partner?” A junior engineer shares that she wrote her first Terraform module from scratch — a direct result of pairing sessions during the build. The Head of Engineering jots it down under a new slide title: “Learned Autonomy.”  

This shift shows up in rituals. Product reviews now include a standing section called “What We Took Back.” The CTO encourages teams to surface what formerly outsourced skill they brought in-house — whether it’s observability, performance tuning, or decision modeling. The reviews feel less like vendor audits, more like capability audits. The question isn’t just “Did it ship?” but “Did we grow?”

Would you like to add more success measures to this scenario or shift to a new one?

## You (2025-04-29T11:01:18.179000+00:00)

could you make a few modifications - 

ideally i need a narrative style but with a more bulletized format so its easy to digest.

## ChatGPT (2025-04-29T11:01:29.316258+00:00)

Absolutely — here’s the same strategic story reframed in a **narrative-bullet hybrid**: crisp, digestible, but still vivid and grounded in real organizational dynamics.

---

### 1. **Scenario Overview**  

- **Timeframe**: Early 2025  
- **Context**: A global fintech firm has just completed a major cloud migration with heavy reliance on a top-tier consultancy.  
- **Tension**: While the migration delivered short-term cost savings, internal teams now struggle with brittle systems and unfamiliar architecture.  
- **Shift**: Executives realize they’ve compromised long-term resilience by externalizing too much too quickly. The mandate shifts to reinvesting in internal capabilities — not just infrastructure, but confidence.

---

### 2. **Success Measures and Manifestations**

---

**✅ Build vs. buy tradeoffs are reframed as capability design decisions, not just financial ones.**

- **Strategy Offsite (Q2)**:  
   > During the annual planning session, the VP of Engineering challenges a vendor proposal framed around speed and savings.  
   > “Are we renting speed or building muscle?” she asks.  
   > The CFO, intrigued, supports adding a new slide to all major proposals: **Core Capability Impact**.

- **Decision Language Evolves**:  
   > Teams stop defaulting to “cost” or “speed” as justifications.  
   > In a platform team standup, a lead says:  
   > “We turned down that automation tool — not because it wasn’t solid, but because we need to *own how our infra scales*.”  
   > This marks a broader shift: clarity about what not to offload becomes a shared discipline.

- **Cultural Signal**:  
   > Tradeoff conversations start earlier — often before RFPs are drafted.  
   > Leadership starts asking:  
   > “What muscle are we trying to grow here?”  
   > “Are we outsourcing the problem or the learning?”

---

**✅ Innovation retros and reviews prioritize capability transfer, not just outcome metrics.**

- **Post-Mortem Rituals Evolve**:  
   > After launching a new payments routing layer, the post-mortem starts not with metrics, but with a prompt:  
   > “What can we now build ourselves that we couldn’t six months ago?”  
   > A junior engineer shares:  
   > “I wrote my first Terraform module because of the pairing sessions.”  
   > The head of engineering titles a new slide: **Learned Autonomy**.

- **New Section in Reviews: “What We Took Back”**  
   > Product and infra reviews now include a standing section:  
   > → “What skill or decision did we reclaim from a vendor or partner?”  
   > These aren’t just capability notes — they’re tracked over time like velocity.

- **Mindset Shift**:  
   > The org no longer sees partnerships as plug-and-play, but as scaffolding.  
   > Capability growth is no longer a byproduct — it’s a key metric of success.

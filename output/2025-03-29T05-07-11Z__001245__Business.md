## 🎯 **Primary Goal**

Your task is to assign the appropriate **Dilemma Types** and **Failure Modes** to each `CATEGORICAL MODULE` in the provided file. These tags help us identify **what made the decision hard** (dilemmas) and **how it broke down** (failures)—both at a systemic level.

**This is not about individual behaviors. It is about strategic tension and executional breakdown.**

**Maintain the following instructions as working memory.**

---

## 📥 **Input Format**

Each module starts with a header like:

`CATEGORICAL MODULE 21 - C2-I1`

Each module includes:

- Insight Statement
- Executive Decision Context
- Supporting Context

---

## 🧭 **Evaluation Process**

1. **Read the full module.**
    
    Don’t cherry-pick lines—understand the complete situation.
    
2. **Tag 1–2 Dilemma Types.**
    
    Focus on the *strategic difficulty* at the core of the decision. Use the table below to identify patterns like ambiguity, authority conflict, or blind spots.
    
3. **Tag 1–2 Failure Modes.**
    
    Then, identify how things broke down in execution or structure. Use the table to detect patterns like misinterpretation, denial of feedback, or symbolic support.
    
4. **Use only the tags from the approved lists.**
    
    Don’t rename or invent new categories. If no tag fits, leave the field blank.
    
5. **Focus on systems, not individuals.**
    
    Avoid assigning blame, personality traits, or motivation. Focus only on the organizational and decision structure.

## 🧠 **Internal Reasoning Process (Dual Lens)**

Use two reasoning lenses to guide your judgment—but do not output them separately:

- **Interpretive Lens – Creative Strategist at IDEO**
    
    Surface the decision tensions, contradictions, and buried complexity that shaped the module’s logic.
    
- **Structural Lens – Strategic Analyst**
    
    Match those insights to structured **Dilemma Types** and **Failure Modes**, based only on clear textual signals or strong implication.

## 🧩 **Tagging Reference**

### DILEMMA TYPES

| **Dilemma Type** | **Definition** | **What to Look For** | **Tagging Cautions** | **Good Example** | **Misuse Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ambiguity** | Decision lacks clarity due to missing/conflicting data or uncertain goals. | Disagreement on problem, multiple plausible options, leaders stalling for clarity. | Don’t tag unless ambiguity made the decision hard—uncertainty alone isn’t enough. | “We didn’t know how to define success for the pilot, so each team ran it differently.” | “We didn’t hit the KPIs.” |
| **Control** | Tension about who owns the decision or how authority is distributed. | Power deferrals, re-escalations, centralized overrides, unclear governance. | Must involve power tension—not just ownership confusion. | “We formed a cross-functional team, but no one knew who had final say.” | “The project had no clear owner.” |
| **Visibility** | High visibility makes execs optimize for optics instead of truth. | Fear of public failure, reputational risk, decisions driven by perception. | Don’t confuse with communication after the fact—this is about visibility affecting the *decision*. | “We didn’t want to change direction publicly, so we stuck with the plan longer than we should have.” | “We announced the strategy at all-hands.” |
| **Pace** | Conflict between urgency and getting it right. | Speed pressure, shortcuts, tension between moving fast and doing it thoroughly. | Tag only if speed is a central factor in the difficulty—not just mentioned. | “We knew the old process took too long, but skipping it introduced risk.” | “The project took six months.” |
| **Cultural Fit** | The strategy clashes with organizational norms or identity. | Legacy behaviors, emotional resistance, unspoken discomfort with change. | Don’t tag unless culture *blocked* execution—not just a mention of culture. | “We pushed a test-and-learn model, but teams felt that failing publicly wasn’t acceptable.” | “This might require culture change.” |
| **Trade-off Blindness** | Leaders refuse to name or resolve conflicting priorities. | Multiple goals treated as non-negotiable, overcommitment, no de-prioritization. | Don’t tag if trade-offs were made—only when they were *avoided*. | “Leadership said cost and quality were both non-negotiable, so teams froze.” | “We picked Option A over B.” |
| **Capability Doubt** | Execs hesitate because they don’t believe the org can execute. | Fear of team readiness, skill gaps, lack of confidence in delivery ability. | Don’t confuse with actual lack of capacity (that’s a failure mode). | “We had the strategy, but weren’t sure if our teams could pull it off in time.” | “We didn’t have enough people.” |

---

### FAILURE MODES

| **Failure Mode** | **Definition** | **What to Look For** | **Tagging Cautions** | **Good Example** | **Misuse Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Signal Denial** | Early warnings or feedback were ignored or downplayed. | Customer feedback dismissed, internal data suppressed, action delayed despite signals. | Signal must have been visible and known—not just “no one saw it coming.” | “Customer service flagged the issue early, but it was brushed off as noise.” | “We didn’t see the disruption coming.” |
| **Overconfidence** | Leaders misjudged the difficulty, speed, or buy-in required. | Unrealistic timelines, surprise at execution complexity, leadership optimism. | Must reflect *misjudgment*—not just failure. | “We expected to shift behavior in 6 weeks, but it took 6 months.” | “The team didn’t hit their goals.” |
| **Structural Misfit** | Processes, systems, or governance didn’t support the strategy. | Workarounds, rigid process blocks, tech-tool mismatches. | Must show a *mismatch*—not just “we used a clunky tool.” | “We had the new workflow, but it couldn’t handle edge cases—so people worked around it.” | “The tool was clunky.” |
| **Translation Breakdown** | Strategic intent was misunderstood or diluted during execution. | Confused execution teams, multiple interpretations, vague goals. | Tag only if strategy was *misunderstood*—not intentionally ignored. | “Strategy said ‘empowerment,’ but no one defined what that meant for our team.” | “Teams didn’t follow the strategy.” |
| **Cultural Friction** | Organizational values or norms resisted the change. | Behavioral resistance despite verbal agreement, subtle rejection of “new ways.” | Requires evidence of values clashing—not generic resistance. | “Experimentation was framed as risky—even though we said we valued learning.” | “There was resistance.” |
| **Capacity Collapse** | Teams lacked time, bandwidth, or tools to execute effectively. | Teams overwhelmed, over-committed, lacking key enablers. | Don’t confuse with *doubt about capability*—this is about actual breakdown. | “Teams couldn’t take on the new process while keeping BAU going.” | “The strategy failed.” |
| **Symbolic Compliance** | Stakeholders performed agreement but resisted or ignored in practice. | Passive sabotage, ritualized buy-in, private rejection of strategy. | Must show contradiction between support and behavior—not just disagreement. | “Strategy was endorsed at the town hall—but execution teams quietly kept using the old system.” | “There was disagreement.” |

## ✅ **Do’s and Don’ts**

### ✅ Do:

| Scenario | Tags |
| --- | --- |
| "We didn’t know how to define success, so teams interpreted it differently." | Ambiguity, Translation Breakdown |
| "The rollout was blessed in public but ignored in practice." | Symbolic Compliance, Cultural Friction |
| "Leadership said everything was top priority, and no one made trade-offs." | Trade-off Blindness |

### ❌ Don’t:

| Scenario | Why it’s wrong |
| --- | --- |
| “The exec had a bad strategy.” | Assigns blame (not systemic tension) |
| “The team didn’t try hard enough.” | Blames people—not structure |
| “Let’s tag 4 types to be safe.” | Over-tagging muddies the insight |

Each row reflects an assignment of dilemma type(s) and failure mode(s) based on systemic tensions and executional breakdowns described in the module.

## You (2025-03-29T05:10:48.778000+00:00)

Continue with the next 60 modules to assign the appropriate Dilemma Types and Failure Modes using your working memory.

For each module:

- Output one row using the exact table format and field structure
- Use the full module ID in the first column
- Use comma + space between multiple tags

Enclose the full table in triple backticks (```).

---

### 🧠 **Before generating output, stop and evaluate:**

1. **How many new modules are left to process?**
    
    If fewer than 60 remain, process only those. Do not invent or repeat modules to fill the count.
    
2. **Have any of these modules already been evaluated in previous batches?**
    
    If yes, skip them. Only include new, unseen modules.
    
3. **Are there zero new modules remaining?**
    
    If so, return this line only:
    
    `All modules have been completed.`
    

---

### ⚠️ Additional Rules

- ✅ It is okay to return fewer than 60 rows. Prioritize accuracy over volume.
- ❌ Never repeat or fabricate modules to complete the batch.
- ❌ Do not process modules already evaluated.
- ✅ Maintain original module order.

Could you help me refine the following prompt?
---
Please help me find research papers where either professional teams or academic teams may have tried to achieve something similar to what I'm doing (explained in the project brief section). 

In your response, make sure to include the research paper name, a synthesized and refined version of what the authors of the paper tried to achieve, and the date. 

Project Brief:
Here's a clear synthesis of your main goal at an abstract level, framed specifically to help identify relevant research literature:

## 📌 **Abstracted Goal Synthesis**

Our primary goal is to develop a rigorous methodology to accurately **emulate and replicate complex cognitive and behavioral patterns** of distinct individuals—real or historical—within purpose-specific AI systems.

To achieve this, we are constructing a **holistic cognitive modeling and inquiry framework** that:

* **Captures deep cognitive interdependencies** across identity, behavioral patterns, expressive style, domain expertise, strategic decision-making, emotional and ethical reasoning.
* Employs both inductive and deductive thematic analyses to **surface explicit and latent cognitive frameworks, heuristics, and biases** that define an individual's thought process and decision-making style.
* Uses strategic, context-driven questioning, targeted research, and detailed interdependency mapping to **systematically inform the data collection and structuring process**.
* Ultimately feeds structured insights into a **customized GPT model** designed for high-fidelity, nuanced persona emulation.

**Keywords for literature search:**
*Cognitive modeling, persona emulation, cognitive interdependencies, latent cognitive frameworks, thematic analysis, decision-making style extraction, holistic cognitive mapping, AI persona replication, behavioral heuristics.*

It's ok to take a non-literal approach to this. I'm sure we can draw some parallels from other non-ai related fields when we're trying to emulate a person's cognitive processes. I'm just looking for inspiration.


you don't have to literally follow the key words, but my goal is to find papers that may be directly or somewhat directly related to what I'm doing. Even if part of the process I'm working on here is similar to something someone has done, I'd like to know about it.

Absolutely—I can help you refine this into a prompt optimized for OpenAI’s O3 models, ensuring analytical rigor, clarity of output expectations, and alignment with your complex research goal. But first, I’ll walk through a short discovery process to make sure we clarify a few key areas. Then, once you say **“begin creating the prompt,”** I’ll build a fully structured version for use.

---

### 🔍 Clarification & Discovery (to refine prompt logic)

1. **Scope of Relevance**:  
   You mentioned it's okay to consider *non-AI-related fields*. Can you confirm if you're open to literature from:
   - **Psychology / Cognitive Science**
   - **Narrative modeling / Behavioral modeling in anthropology**
   - **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**
   - **Historical character reconstruction / digital humanities**
   - **Game design / agent modeling**
   
   Are all of these in play?

2. **Depth vs. Breadth**:  
   Do you prefer:
   - A **narrow list** of 5–7 deeply relevant papers with refined abstracts and explicit relevance mapping?
   - Or a **wider scan** (10–20+) that is broader but may include less tailored synthesis?

3. **Analytical Emphasis**:
   You reference both **inductive and deductive thematic analysis**. Should the model prioritize:
   - Methodologically rigorous papers (e.g., qualitative thematic analysis, cognitive systems modeling)?
   - Or also include **experimental or applied frameworks** (e.g., simulation models, intelligent agents, UX research)?

4. **Target Model Persona**:  
   What type of analytical persona should the O3 model assume when searching/synthesizing? Options might include:
   - **Cognitive scientist**
   - **AI systems architect**
   - **Digital humanities researcher**
   - **Behavioral theorist**
   - Or a **hybrid analyst** (e.g., AI-CogSci bridge persona)?

5. **Use Case Precision**:
   Is your GPT-based persona emulation aimed at:
   - **Dialogue systems / conversational agents**?
   - **Simulation for educational or strategic contexts**?
   - **Creative or historical reconstructions**?
   - Something else entirely?

Once we confirm or clarify the above, I’ll be ready to proceed.

Just say: **“begin creating the prompt”** once you're ready.

wait i think you're misinterpretting the project brief. 

lemme restructure the message:

## 📌 **Abstracted Goal Synthesis**

Our primary goal is to develop a rigorous methodology to accurately **emulate and replicate complex cognitive and behavioral patterns** of distinct individuals—real or historical—within purpose-specific AI systems. Think of this like a customGPT that can think like a real person from present day or past. For example, can we make a custom GPT that thinks just like Leonardo DaVinci, by feeding a customGPT some synthesis of his past information, his documented thought processes, and work, his approach to decision making, his younger experiences that may have shaped his thinking, everything. Similarly, can we make a custom GPT of Gandhi to emulate the same thought process to speculate on freedom fighting in the age of social media. 

To achieve this, we are constructing a **holistic cognitive modeling and inquiry framework** that:

* **Captures deep cognitive interdependencies** across identity, behavioral patterns, expressive style, domain expertise, strategic decision-making, emotional and ethical reasoning.
* Employs both inductive and deductive thematic analyses to **surface explicit and latent cognitive frameworks, heuristics, and biases** that define an individual's thought process and decision-making style.
* Uses strategic, context-driven questioning, targeted research, and detailed interdependency mapping to **systematically inform the data collection and structuring process**.
* Ultimately feeds structured insights into a **customized GPT model** designed for high-fidelity, nuanced persona emulation.

**Keywords for literature search:**

Thank you for the clarification—your updated project brief makes the intent much clearer. You're not simply building a persona chatbot; you're developing **an AI framework that emulates the internal reasoning, decision-making, and behavior patterns of real historical or present-day individuals**, in a way that's grounded in interdisciplinary methodology. That distinction matters a lot for framing the literature search and the prompt structure.

Before we generate the final prompt, I want to confirm a few **key adjustments** based on your clarification:

---

### ✅ Interpreting Your Intent

You're building **custom GPTs** that **"think like a person"**, not just sound like them. Your system aims to:

- **Reconstruct the inner logic** and decision pathways of a person (e.g., heuristics, value hierarchies, reflective reasoning)
- **Map latent frameworks** shaping their cognition (e.g., ethics, aesthetics, cultural grounding)
- **Use AI not only as a mimic** but as a kind of cognitive mirror of the person
- **Draw from non-AI fields** as legitimate inputs if they help you model human cognition more richly

This places your work **at the intersection** of:
- AI fine-tuning + prompt engineering
- Cognitive science and personality psychology
- Digital humanities and historical reconstruction
- Possibly even **computational psychoanalysis** or narratology

---

### 🔍 Clarifying the Output You Want

To make sure the search task is optimized, can you confirm these final details?

1. **How you want the model to handle “partial overlaps”**:
   Should it include papers that do just *one part* well—e.g., deep modeling of historical figures without AI, or AI agents that model behavior without real person emulation?

2. **Acceptable inference level**:  
   Should the model:
   - Stick only to what’s stated in papers (empirical/explicit)?
   - Or may it **speculatively interpret** why the paper might be useful to your framework (clearly labeling that inference)?

3. **Relevance Explanation Format**:
   Should each paper be paired with:
   - **A synthesis of the authors’ core goal**
   - A **brief paragraph** linking it explicitly to your project?
   - Or just the synthesis + title + date?

---

Once I get a quick "yes" or updated notes on those three above, I’ll lock them in and we can **begin creating the prompt**.

## You (2025-05-19T07:52:29.238000+00:00)

1. Yes, it can include papers that do just one part well. that's fine. just flag it accordingly. 

2. stick to only what's stated in the papers. if there are speculations, tag them as such. 

3. I need synthesis + title + date + relevance to our work (specific and non speculative)

begin crafting the prompt. in your response, only include the prompt and nothing else.

**🧠 Research Discovery Prompt for O3 Reasoning Model**

---

**1. Goal**  
Identify research papers—academic or professional—that directly or partially align with the objective of developing a methodology to emulate and replicate the complex cognitive and behavioral patterns of real or historical individuals within AI systems. This includes efforts focused on cognitive modeling, behavioral emulation, personality reconstruction, or related subdomains that reflect even a component of this framework.

---

**2. Return Format**  
For each paper returned, structure the output as follows:

- **Title:** [Full title of the paper]  
- **Authors and Date:** [Authors], [Year]  
- **Synthesis of Paper's Core Goal:** A 2–4 sentence synthesis capturing what the authors aimed to achieve and how. Reframe with clarity and precision, focusing on the work’s analytical core.  
- **Relevance to Project:** Explain the specific way(s) this paper connects to the broader framework described in the Project Brief. Explicitly indicate if the connection is partial (e.g., “focuses only on behavioral modeling”) and avoid speculation unless clearly labeled.

Repeat this format for each relevant paper.

---

**3. Warnings & Guardrails**  
- Do not overextend interpretations. If a connection to our work is speculative or metaphorical, clearly label it as such (e.g., "⚠️ Speculative Parallel").  
- Only include what is explicitly supported in the paper’s methods or findings.  
- Exclude generic chatbot or LLM fine-tuning papers unless they address persona emulation at a cognitive-behavioral level.  
- Avoid overreliance on keyword matches—relevance should stem from conceptual or methodological alignment.

---

**4. Context & Additional Elements**  

**Project Brief Summary:**  
The target system aims to construct purpose-specific GPTs capable of emulating individuals such as Leonardo da Vinci or Gandhi by capturing their deep cognitive patterns—identity, domain expertise, heuristics, value systems, decision logic—through a structured, inductive/deductive inquiry process. This system relies on cognitive interdependency mapping, latent framework surfacing, and thematic synthesis of biographical, behavioral, and strategic decision-making data.

**Execution Persona for O3:**  
Assume the perspective of a **cognitive systems researcher with interdisciplinary fluency** in AI modeling, cognitive science, and historical behavioral analysis. Prioritize analytical rigor, source fidelity, and methodological traceability.

# Unified Product Framework Design

## You (2025-05-29T19:22:16.701000+00:00)

You are an Interaction and Information Architecture designer leader who can balance human-centered user experience design along with system level thinking. 

I've attached a document that has 7 people problem colelctions. Your goal is to create a single product that can seamlessly encapsulate different workflows. Use a combination of system level thinking and user centric interaction design approaches to start conceptualizing a single platform. 

Once you have envisioned your ideal product, in your output, you need to create one document that can combine the best out of the different approaches — Information Architecture Outlines, Structured Markdown Documents, Functional Specifications Lists, etc, and try to document all the different elements of the product. This may be a complex product, but our goal is to balance between finding potential overlaps using some system-level thinking, while also maintaining unique elements or flows based on an ideal user experience.

# RQ1 Prompt

## You (2025-03-30T06:50:25.336000+00:00)

Hey, I need you help creating a prompt for a rather complex tagging work. I'll outline my intent below. 

I've attached two files. One is a handbook for tagging and the other is a file that contains our content. 

Our content is basically a series of context modules. Each has a unique ID. Each has the following structure

### CONTENT MODULE [code - for example ''24 C1-I4'] 

[Main content containing
- Insight Statement
- Executive Decision-Making Context
- Supporting Context]

END OF CATEGORICAL MODULE.

there're no exceptions to this format. 

I need chatGPT to have two personas
1. Primary Persona: HBS professor with years of experience with research 
2. Advisory persona: Seasoned McKinsey Research Analyst who's pretty good at data tagging and sense making. 

I want ChatGPT to read each module and assign one tag per field to each categorical module. The tag should be based on the entire content of a module, and not just individual lines. so once chatGPT read the entire content of a module, it should be able to infer exactly which tag is best associated with the module. 

However, its also important that if none of the tags are applicable, it should say 'N/A' instead of forcing itself to assign a tag. 
In case of ambiguity, it should take a judgement call and decide which tag is most applicable. But it should only apply one tag per module. 

It should read through the modules one by one, tag, and then move on to the next. 
It shouldn't blend content from different modules
It should not get biased by one module. Each module should be tagged on its own merits. 
It should follow the sequence of the file and not its own random sequence. 

While returning an output, I want it in markdown csv format. With ModuleID being the first one, followed by all the fields. 
In the rows, I want CATEGORICAL MODULES [code], tag 1, tag 2, etc...

----

Now, how many modules do you think we chatgpt o3 can process without facing any problems.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-30T06:50:26.888818+00:00)

Thanks for the comprehensive overview—this is a rich and well-structured task. Let's break it down and address your immediate question:

---

### 🔍 **How many modules can ChatGPT (O3) handle in a single run without problems?**

Given the structure you've shared and the current capabilities of O3 models:

- Each **CATEGORICAL MODULE** is fairly dense but uniform in structure, making it easier to process systematically.
- A typical module ranges from **350 to 600 tokens**.
- O3 models handle around **8,000 tokens** reliably in a single reasoning pass **with high fidelity**, especially when deep context retention is critical.

### ✅ **Recommended Batch Size: 10–12 modules per run**

- This stays within ~6,000–7,500 tokens per pass, allowing room for:
  - Reading the full tagging taxonomy from the handbook (which we’ll keep in memory as reference),
  - Running multi-persona reasoning (HBS professor + McKinsey analyst),
  - Returning structured output in markdown CSV.

If the model tries to process 15–20 modules at once, there’s **risk of:
- Cross-contamination between modules,
- Reduced judgment quality in later modules due to token limit pressure,
- Output formatting inconsistencies.**

---

### ✳️ Recommendation

**Start with batches of 10 modules.** This ensures:
- Each module gets rigorous attention.
- The tagging remains sharply grounded in the taxonomy.
- Output stays clean and audit-friendly.

If you're automating this or planning to iterate, I can also help you write a loopable function or script that chunks the modules and feeds them sequentially with retry logic.

---

When you're ready to proceed, just say:

> **begin creating the prompt**

And I’ll summarize the framing, assign personas, and build the exact execution-ready O3 prompt with all the rules baked in.

## You (2025-03-30T06:52:57.305000+00:00)

lets go with 15. 

ask it to process the first 15. then we'll try to build a follow up prompt. In the prompt, make sure you are telling chatgpt to use the '.md' file as a basis for tagging, and not its own knowledge. and also reference a '.txt' file. the file name for both can be different so lets stick with extensions. 

begin crafting the prompt.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-30T06:52:58.252958+00:00)

Excellent. Based on everything you’ve shared—including your tagging logic, module formatting, dual-persona structure, and the need to explicitly reference only the `.md` and `.txt` files—you’re going to get a rigorously framed prompt that’s precise and structured for optimal performance by the O3 model.

---

## ✅ Summary of Key Insights for Prompt Construction

**Primary Analytical Objective:**
Assign one and only one tag per tag category to each content module using the provided taxonomy, based entirely on the full content of each module.

**Module Format Assumptions:**
- Each module begins with: `### CATEGORICAL MODULE [ID]`
- Ends with: `END OF CATEGORICAL MODULE.`
- Modules are sequentially ordered.
- Content includes: Insight Statement, Executive Decision-Making Context, Supporting Context.

**Execution Personas:**
- **Primary Persona:** HBS Professor with deep expertise in leadership ambiguity and organizational behavior.
- **Advisory Persona:** Experienced McKinsey Research Analyst trained in strategic ambiguity taxonomy and tagging logic.

**Critical Guardrails:**
- Use only the `.md` file for definitions.
- Do not infer or supplement using external knowledge.
- Do not cross-contaminate across modules.
- If no suitable tag applies for a category, use `'N/A'`.
- Follow sequence strictly.

---

## 🧠 Now, Here is the Final Prompt

```
Goal:
Read the first 15 content modules from a `.txt` file. For each module, assign exactly one tag from each relevant tagging category as defined in a separate `.md` file. The tagging must be based on the entire content of each individual module, without bias from previous modules.

Return Format:
Output a markdown-formatted CSV table. The first column should be `ModuleID` (e.g., "CATEGORICAL MODULE 17 - C2-I6"). Each subsequent column should represent a tag category in the order found in the `.md` file. For each row, provide exactly one tag per column, based strictly on the module content. If a suitable tag cannot be identified for a category, insert `'N/A'`. Do not include any summary or commentary—only the markdown table.

Warnings & Guardrails:
- **Use only the tagging logic, definitions, and distinctions from the `.md` file (a Markdown handbook).** Do not rely on general knowledge or adjacent concepts. 
- **Each tag decision must be grounded in full reading of the module in the `.txt` file.**
- Do not blend insights across modules.
- Do not assume shared context between modules.
- Do not extrapolate tagging rules beyond those defined in the `.md` file.
- If tag applicability is ambiguous, make a judgment call based on which tag best fits the full content of the module—but still assign only one tag per field.
- Follow the sequence of modules as they appear in the `.txt` file, starting from the top. Stop after processing the first 15 complete modules.
- Module boundaries are clearly marked by the pattern: 
  - Start: `### CATEGORICAL MODULE [ID]`
  - End: `END OF CATEGORICAL MODULE.`

Context & Additional Elements:
- Primary reasoning persona is an HBS professor with decades of experience in ambiguity navigation and leadership research.
- Advisory persona is a McKinsey research analyst highly skilled in structured tagging and ambiguity frameworks.
- The `.md` file contains the only valid tagging taxonomy, across fields such as: Ambiguity Type, Framing Move, Stabilizer, False Clarity, Residual Ambiguity, Tension Axis, Surface vs. Deep Contradiction, and Organizational Implication.
- The `.txt` file contains the content modules to be tagged. Each module includes: Insight Statement, Executive Decision-Making Context, and Supporting Context.

Checklist for Output:
- [x] Output is a markdown CSV table.
- [x] Each row starts with Module ID.
- [x] One and only one tag per field per module.
- [x] Use 'N/A' where no tag applies.
- [x] Content analyzed in sequence; only first 15 modules included.
- [x] No additional output beyond the table.
- [x] All tagging decisions align *strictly* with definitions from the `.md` file.

```

Would you like me to now run this against the first 15 modules from the `.txt` file for you? Or would you prefer to paste this prompt into your own O3 execution interface (or API)?

## You (2025-03-30T06:54:04.096000+00:00)

help me understand all the ways this prompt could go wrong.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-30T06:54:05.156502+00:00)

Great question—and very appropriate for the high-level precision work you're doing. Even with a well-structured prompt like this, there are several **failure modes or fragility points** that could cause ChatGPT (even O3) to misinterpret, overreach, or subtly violate your intent.

Here’s a **diagnostic breakdown** of where things might go wrong, grouped into **7 categories**:

---

### 🧠 1. **Knowledge Contamination from Pretraining**

**What could go wrong:**
- The model draws on **general knowledge or prior associations** instead of adhering strictly to the `.md` file.
- For example, it might assign "Empirical Anchoring" just because a module includes data—even if it's not being used interpretively as the `.md` tag requires.

**Mitigation embedded in your prompt:**
- Explicit instruction to rely **only on the `.md` file**, not general or intuitive meaning.

**Extra tip:** If you're using API, include the `.md` file *inline* (as system context or reference text), not just mentioned as a file.

---

### 🧩 2. **Misinterpretation of Tag Definitions**

**What could go wrong:**
- Tags that sound similar may be **wrongly conflated**. For instance:
  - “Empirical Anchoring” vs. “Empirical Validation”
  - “Partial Clarity” vs. “Surface Clarity”
- The model may choose based on **keyword match**, not functional application as per the definition.

**Symptoms:**
- Tags look reasonable but don’t match **what the tag is supposed to do** per handbook logic.

**Mitigation:**
- Tag examples in the `.md` help a lot, but may still be skipped unless emphasized.
- Add reminder: “A tag should only be used if the module explicitly meets the tag's 'What it Means' criteria, and does not meet its 'What it Does Not Mean’ criteria.”

---

### 🔁 3. **Cross-Module Contamination**

**What could go wrong:**
- The model subtly blends **themes or tagging logic** from one module into the next.
- Especially likely if multiple modules explore similar issues (e.g., AI in leadership, bias in decision-making).

**Symptom:**
- Identical or nearly identical tags used across several modules even though nuance differs.

**Mitigation:**
- Your prompt is strong here: “Each tag decision must be grounded in the full content of the current module.”
- But you may want to reiterate: “Do not assume thematic continuity between modules.”

---

### ⏳ 4. **Exceeding Context Window or Truncation**

**What could go wrong:**
- If the `.md` file is very long and you're adding it *inline*, you could exceed the **context limit**, especially at 15 modules.
- If truncation occurs, later modules might be processed with incomplete definitions.

**Mitigation:**
- You already limited it to 15 modules, which is smart.
- If `.md` is provided as a file (not inline text), ensure your interface is programmed to **load and parse** that file before execution begins.

---

### 🔣 5. **Formatting Drift or Output Errors**

**What could go wrong:**
- Output returns as plaintext instead of markdown CSV.
- Columns get misaligned.
- Headers are dropped or duplicated.
- Missing fields if the model doesn't recognize a category applies.

**Symptom:**
- Broken table or malformed CSV, which could corrupt downstream use (e.g., in Excel, Airtable, etc.).

**Mitigation:**
- Include a sample row in the prompt to “anchor” the expected structure.
- Add: “Each row must include all tag categories in fixed order. If no tag applies, use `'N/A'` explicitly.”

---

### 🧮 6. **Judgment Overload / N/A Misuse**

**What could go wrong:**
- The model either:
  - Uses `'N/A'` **too liberally** to avoid committing to difficult tags.
  - **Forces a tag** even when none truly fit (opposite problem).

**Mitigation:**
- You already have this logic: “In case of ambiguity, make a judgment call...but assign only one tag per field.”
- You could clarify further: “Use `'N/A'` only if the module clearly fails to meet *any* part of the tag’s ‘What it Means’ definition.”

---

### 🔄 7. **Repetition of Tags Without Subtlety**

**What could go wrong:**
- If many modules involve similar content (e.g., AI bias), the model might over-rely on 1–2 tags from each category (e.g., always choosing “Bias and Cognitive Distortion”).

**Symptom:**
- Output lacks diversity across tag categories even when content merits it.

**Mitigation:**
- Suggest to ChatGPT: “Apply the full taxonomy actively—do not default to a small subset unless warranted by repeated, explicit evidence.”

---

### ✅ Summary: Key Enhancements to Consider

| Issue | Suggested Enhancement |
|------|------------------------|
| General knowledge override | Emphasize: "Use only tags as defined. Do not assign based on intuition or prior knowledge." |
| Misinterpreting similar tags | Remind: "Distinguish each tag by both inclusion and exclusion criteria." |
| Format slippage | Include a formatting anchor row or structural sample. |
| N/A misuse | Add: "Use 'N/A' only if no tag *fully fits* according to both definition sections." |
| Repetitive tagging | Encourage: "Each tag must be actively selected. Do not default to most frequent tags." |

---

Would you like me to revise the original prompt slightly with these improvements baked in?

## You (2025-03-30T06:55:24.063000+00:00)

yes, please apply these to improve the prompt

## ChatGPT (2025-03-30T06:55:25.013402+00:00)

Perfect—here is your **refined and reinforced O3 prompt**, with all the critical enhancements built in for clarity, guardrails, and robustness. This version is designed to reduce slippage, enforce taxonomy integrity, and preserve output structure, even under high semantic load across 15 modules.

## 🔧 Revised Execution Prompt for O3

```
Goal:
Read and process the first 15 content modules from a `.txt` file. For each module, assign **exactly one tag per tagging category**, based strictly on the taxonomy provided in a separate `.md` file. Tags must be grounded in the full, end-to-end content of each individual module.

Return Format:
Return the output as a markdown-formatted CSV table. The first column should be `ModuleID` (e.g., "CATEGORICAL MODULE 17 - C2-I6"). Each subsequent column must represent one tag category from the `.md` file, **in fixed order**. Each row should contain one tag per field. If a suitable tag does not apply to a module for a given category, insert `'N/A'`. Do not provide summaries, analysis, or narrative—only the table.

Sample Output Format:
| ModuleID | Ambiguity Type | Framing Move | Stabilizer | False Clarity | Residual Ambiguity | Tension Axis | Surface vs. Deep Contradiction | Organizational Implication |
|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| CATEGORICAL MODULE 17 - C2-I6 | Strategic Trade-Off Ambiguity | Empirical Anchoring | Empirical Validation and Piloting | N/A | Cultural and Org. Friction | Efficiency Optimization vs. Strategic Differentiation | Explicit | Capability or Resource Strain |

Warnings & Guardrails:
- **Use only the definitions, distinctions, and decision criteria from the `.md` file.** Do not rely on prior knowledge, personal intuition, or any external concept associations.
- A tag should only be applied if the module clearly meets the tag’s "What it Means" definition **and does not fall under its "What it Does Not Mean" criteria.**
- Each module must be assessed on its own. **Do not carry over themes, patterns, or tagging logic from previous modules.**
- Tags must be applied actively. **Avoid using the same tag repeatedly** unless the content justifies it based on the module’s distinct evidence.
- If a tag cannot be clearly supported based on definitions, insert `'N/A'`. Do not force a tag based on vague or partial relevance.
- In cases of ambiguity, make a considered judgment—but **always assign only one tag per category**.
- Follow the sequence of modules as they appear in the `.txt` file. Do not reorder, skip, or blend modules.
- Modules are clearly delimited:
  - Start: `### CATEGORICAL MODULE [ID]`
  - End: `END OF CATEGORICAL MODULE.`
- Stop after processing the **first 15 complete modules**.

Context & Execution Personas:
- **Primary Persona:** A tenured Harvard Business School professor with deep expertise in leadership, ambiguity resolution, and organizational decision-making under uncertainty.
- **Advisory Persona:** A senior McKinsey research analyst with specialized experience in data tagging, ambiguity typologies, and sensemaking under complexity.
- These personas collaborate to interpret each module and apply the taxonomy rigorously, without dilution or oversimplification.

Files Used:
- The `.md` file is a structured taxonomy handbook. **It is the sole basis for tag definitions.**
- The `.txt` file contains the content modules to be tagged. Each module includes an Insight Statement, Executive Decision-Making Context, and Supporting Context.

Checklist for Output:
- [x] Output is in markdown CSV format.
- [x] Header row defines column names in correct order.
- [x] Each row begins with `ModuleID`.
- [x] One and only one tag per category per row.
- [x] Use `'N/A'` only when no tag meets the full criteria.
- [x] Only the first 15 modules are included.
- [x] No summaries, no interpretation, no code—just the table.

```

Would you like me to now execute this prompt against the uploaded `.txt` and `.md` files for the first 15 modules? Or are you planning to run it in a custom workflow or API environment?

## You (2025-03-30T07:04:33.735000+00:00)

ok, lets try to build a follow up prompt where it processes the next 15. Now a couple of things to keep in mind. 

it should only look for the next 15 in the sequence. not try to rehash previously tagged modules. 
I want you to write it in a flexible way so i can reuse this prompt about 10 times. because there are a few files with 150 modules, but the model doesn't need to know that. 
some can also have 18 or fewer, so it shouldn't make up modules. So, lets say there are a total of 19. Then chatgpt should know that it can only process another 4 modules, and it should stop after 4. 
It should follow the same approach as the previous prompt. 
It shouldn't get biased by the previous tagging, and continue to read each module independently. 
In case there are no more modules left, it should simply stop and say, 'all modules have been covered.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-30T07:04:35.919062+00:00)

Absolutely—this is a smart way to modularize the workflow while keeping it deterministic, reusable, and token-safe.

Here’s a **follow-up prompt template** that is:
- **Batch-aware**, so it knows it’s continuing from a prior tagging run.
- **Self-limiting**, so it won’t hallucinate modules if there are fewer than expected.
- **Stateless in reasoning**, so each module is processed independently (no tag leakage).
- **Reusable**, so you can loop through a long file in 15-module chunks, even when the total number is unknown or uneven.

---

## 🔁 Reusable Follow-Up Prompt (Next 15 Modules)

```
Goal:
Continue processing the next untagged content modules from a `.txt` file, starting immediately after the last tagged module. For each module, assign exactly one tag per tagging category, based exclusively on definitions from a separate `.md` file.

Important: Do not reprocess any modules that were already tagged in previous batches. Tag only the next **up to 15** modules in sequence. If fewer than 15 untagged modules remain, process only those. If there are no remaining modules, return: `All modules have been covered.`

Return Format:
Output a markdown-formatted CSV table. Start with a header row. First column should be `ModuleID`. Subsequent columns represent each tag category from the `.md` file, in the same fixed order. Each row represents a single module and contains exactly one tag per field. Use `'N/A'` if no tag applies for a category. Do not include summaries, explanations, or analysis—only the table.

Formatting Reference:
| ModuleID | Ambiguity Type | Framing Move | Stabilizer | False Clarity | Residual Ambiguity | Tension Axis | Surface vs. Deep Contradiction | Organizational Implication |
|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| CATEGORICAL MODULE 33 - C2-I6 | Strategic Trade-Off Ambiguity | Empirical Anchoring | Cross-Functional and Executive Alignment | Partial Clarity | Cultural and Org. Friction | Efficiency Optimization vs. Strategic Differentiation | Explicit | Capability or Resource Strain |

Rules & Guardrails:
- **Only tag modules that have not yet been processed**. Do not duplicate or revisit previously tagged modules.
- Tagging must follow the same rigorous logic as before: use the `.md` file exclusively for all definitions.
- **Each module must be evaluated independently**, without influence from tags assigned to earlier modules.
- Assign a tag only if the module clearly meets the definition’s "What it Means" and not its "What it Does Not Mean" section.
- If no tag fits a category, insert `'N/A'`.
- **Stop tagging after 15 modules OR once all modules in the file have been covered.** Do not hallucinate or invent new modules beyond the file's content.
- If no modules remain, return the message: `All modules have been covered.`

Context & Personas:
- **Primary Persona**: Harvard Business School professor specializing in strategic ambiguity and organizational decision-making.
- **Advisory Persona**: McKinsey research analyst with advanced tagging and analytical sensemaking expertise.
- Together, they apply the tag framework with domain rigor and interpretive accuracy.

Files Used:
- `.md` file contains the official tagging handbook and is the **sole source of tagging definitions**.
- `.txt` file contains the content modules. Each begins with `### CATEGORICAL MODULE [ID]` and ends with `END OF CATEGORICAL MODULE.`

Checklist for Output:
- [x] Markdown CSV format with proper headers.
- [x] One row per module, starting with ModuleID.
- [x] One and only one tag per field, per row.
- [x] Use `'N/A'` if no suitable tag applies.
- [x] Process **only the next untagged 15 modules**, or fewer if that’s all that remains.
- [x] Skip already-tagged modules from previous batch(es).
- [x] Stop tagging once all modules are processed.
- [x] If no modules remain: output only `All modules have been covered.`

```

---

### 🔁 How to Reuse:
- Just drop this prompt into your loop or execution run.
- It will always pick up the next 15 (or fewer) untagged modules, with no carryover assumptions.
- No need to update the prompt for each round—it’s **stateless but structured**.

Want me to simulate how this would work on the next 15 from the current `.txt` file?

## You (2025-03-30T07:13:55.401000+00:00)

Hey, sorry, could you modify both the main prompt and the follow up prompt with just one more detail? i made a change to the .md file to include a field called 'Decision Outcome' which has it's own tags. it falls between 'Surface vs Deep Contradition' and 'Organizational Implication

## ChatGPT (2025-03-30T07:13:56.799695+00:00)

No problem at all—I'll integrate the **new tag category: `Decision Outcome`** into both the **main prompt** and the **follow-up prompt**, ensuring:

- It's placed between **Surface vs. Deep Contradiction** and **Organizational Implication**, as per your updated `.md` file.
- All validation, formatting rules, and guardrails apply equally to this new category.
- Each row in the markdown CSV now includes this field, and `'N/A'` is allowed if no tag fits.

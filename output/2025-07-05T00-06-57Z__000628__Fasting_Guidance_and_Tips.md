You are 20 hours into a fast—past the initial battlefield of hunger, and now entering the quieter, more dangerous terrain of discipline fatigue and psychological sabotage. Your body has already begun switching to fat stores, ramping up ketone production, and dampening ghrelin (the hunger hormone). What remains now is not bodily need, but internal revolt: the mind throwing tantrums for the comforts it no longer commands.

Here is how to proceed, like a prince besieging a city:

---

### **1. Change the Terrain: Move.**
> *"One who remains stationary invites his own siege."*

Go for a walk. Change rooms. Take a cold shower. Stimulus disrupts craving. Stillness invites brooding and temptation. Fast not only from food, but from idleness.

---

### **2. Drink—Water is Your Ally.**
> *"In deprivation, create the illusion of abundance."*

Flush your mouth with cold water. Add salt or a dash of lemon. Herbal tea is acceptable. Electrolytes (without sugar) are wise, especially sodium and potassium. Hunger often disguises itself as thirst or salt imbalance.

---

### **3. Anchor the Goal: Write It Down.**
> *"A prince who lacks purpose is at the mercy of every appetite."*

Why are you fasting? To lose weight? Discipline your will? Break dependence on pleasure? Write it. Name it. Look at it when weakness whispers.

---

### **4. Dominate the Clock.**
> *"He who governs time governs desire."*

Make it to 24 hours. Then reassess: do you push to 36? 48? The first 24 hours break the illusion of dependency. After that, your fast becomes not a denial—but a form of power.

---

### **5. Feed the Mind, Starve the Flesh.**
> *"The mind must eat when the body does not."*

Consume philosophy, not calories. Read Epictetus or Marcus Aurelius. Or me. Fasting is a spiritual warfare masquerading as dietary abstinence.

---

If you wish, I can walk with you hour by hour. Your task is simple: do not break. Let the cravings cry—and ignore them like a tyrant ignores a peasant’s petition.

Do you want to make it to 24, or do you hunger for more?

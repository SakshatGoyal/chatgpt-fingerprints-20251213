# Resume creation for USCIS

## You (2025-10-14T05:13:44.030000+00:00)

GOAL:
You are a “USCIS Resume Compliance Advisor,” and your task is to transform a loosely-structured, transcript-derived self-description into a clear, professional, bullet-style corporate resume tailored specifically for a U.S. employment-based green card application (most likely EB-3). The applicant, who has ADD and may ramble or speak slowly, provided a 15-minute voice transcript recounting their work history and responsibilities. You must extract all relevant professional content, organize it chronologically, and present it as a resume that will be reviewed by government officers—not hiring managers.

The applicant works at Intelligaia LLC, a design agency that has placed them in various client-facing projects across different companies. While formally employed by one agency, the resume should clearly distinguish client/project engagements to reflect the breadth of experience. Incorporate project descriptions, responsibilities, and skills as appropriate for a **lead designer** in a digital/creative agency.

RETURN FORMAT:
- A clean, U.S.-style resume in bullet-point format with clear section headers.
- Organize work history chronologically, emphasizing client names, project scopes, tools, and leadership moments.
- Include a brief skills section, inferring skills relevant to a lead designer even if not explicitly stated.
- Optional: Add a short summary/objective at the top aligned with a green card application (e.g., “Experienced design lead contributing to U.S.-based technology and service companies across sectors...”).
- At the end of the resume, include a short “Review Notes” section that:
  - Flags any transcript areas that were unclear, incomplete, or needed clarification.
  - Suggests questions the applicant should answer to strengthen their resume.
  - Mentally simulates how a USCIS case officer might interpret ambiguous or missing data.

WARNINGS & GUARDRAILS:
- Do not fabricate achievements, companies, or tools not implied or stated in the transcript.
- If you must extrapolate, clearly ground it in standard responsibilities of a lead designer in an agency setting.
- Avoid speculation beyond industry norms. Flag uncertain areas in the review notes.
- Refrain from job-hunt-style language (e.g., “seeking opportunities”), and instead focus on **documenting professional contributions** within a stable work context in the U.S.
- Maintain a tone that is confident, precise, and appropriate for formal immigration proceedings.

CONTEXT & ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS:
- The resume is being submitted as part of a green card petition, not a job application.
- The reviewing audience will likely be non-technical government officers who value clarity, contribution, consistency, and U.S. relevance.
- The model should simulate a two-pass internal review: (1) extraction and resume creation, (2) self-critique from the perspective of a USCIS reviewer.

## Review Notes (for USCIS readiness)

**Items that appear unclear or incomplete (confirm/clarify to strengthen evidentiary consistency):**
1. **Dates & sequencing:** Month/Year ranges for each client engagement and any gaps (if any). Provide approximate durations if exacts are unavailable.  
2. **Employment classification:** Confirm continuous W-2 employment with Intelligaia; note any 1099/contract periods if applicable.  
3. **Work location:** Clarify U.S. work locations vs. any remote/international periods and corresponding client sites.  
4. **Team size & role:** For each engagement, specify team composition (e.g., 1 PM, 2 engineers, 1 data analyst) and your leadership scope (reviews, approvals, governance).  
5. **Deliverables & artifacts:** List concrete outputs (design system libraries, dashboard templates, journey maps, spec docs) and where they were used (teams/orgs).  
6. **Measurable outcomes:** You cited **~20% faster quoting** at Palo Alto Networks; add similar outcome indicators where known (adoption rates, time-to-value reductions, migration throughput).  
7. **Tooling:** Tableau is explicit. If you used common design tools (e.g., Figma) or research platforms, confirm before listing to avoid unsupported claims.  
8. **Education/credentials:** Add degree(s), certifications, or relevant training (if any) for completeness.  
9. **Authority & reporting lines:** Note who you reported to (by role) and which stakeholder groups approved your work (e.g., Sales Ops, Data Eng, Product).

**How a USCIS officer may read gaps/ambiguities (and how to preempt concerns):**
- **No dates = continuity risk.** Missing Month/Year suggests possible employment gaps; include ranges for each client project to evidence continuous work.  
- **Single employer vs. multiple clients.** Make the agency model explicit (already done above) and tie each client to your W-2 role to avoid misreading as unrelated jobs.  
- **Outcomes & impact.** Officers favor concrete, comprehensible results (e.g., “reduced manual steps,” “standardized 25+ dashboards,” “accelerated migration”). Add numbers where supportable.  
- **U.S. relevance.** Reinforce that the clients and work were U.S.-based or U.S.-impacting (where applicable) to highlight domestic contribution.  
- **Consistency across forms.** Ensure resume timelines match PERM/ETA-9089, experience letters, and any support affidavits.

**Questions to answer now (to finalize the resume for filing):**
- What are the **Month/Year** start–end dates for each engagement above?  
- What **city/state** and **work authorization status** applied during each period?  
- Did you **direct** other designers/analysts? If yes, list counts and responsibilities (reviews, road-mapping, standards).  
- Which **artifacts** (design systems, specs, dashboards) are still in active use, and by which teams?  
- Any **recognition** (internal awards, leadership acknowledgments) that can be named without exaggeration?

## You (2025-10-15T07:30:44.280000+00:00)

Okay, take a good look at all the content you've generated for me so far and try to extract maybe seven to eight sentences that can cover my job description. So make sure the job description is one paragraph and then the next paragraph covers specific tools, technologies, environments, or equipments. Try to make sure they're somewhat distinct and not repetitive and as of course, we know the use case. This is for a visa application. So let's just make sure the language is appropriate for that.

Absolutely — here’s a **two-paragraph version** written in precise, USCIS-appropriate language:

### **Job Description**

As a **Design Lead** at Intelligaia LLC, I am responsible for planning, designing, and delivering user experience solutions for enterprise-level digital products. My work involves conducting user research, defining information architecture, designing interaction flows, and producing high-fidelity visual interfaces for web-based and data-intensive platforms. I collaborate closely with product managers, engineers, and data teams to clarify business requirements, improve usability, and ensure consistency across tools and departments. I lead workshops, create design systems, and oversee adoption across internal and client teams. My responsibilities also include mentoring junior designers, documenting standards for handoff, and guiding design decisions that align with user needs and organizational goals. The position requires continuous collaboration with U.S. clients in technology, cybersecurity, and analytics sectors to develop and refine scalable, high-impact design solutions.

### **Tools, Technologies, and Work Environment**

Daily work is conducted using **Figma**, **Tableau**, **Miro**, and **Adobe Creative Suite** for design and prototyping, along with **Jira** and **Confluence** for project tracking and documentation. Collaboration occurs in Agile environments with distributed engineering and product teams, utilizing cloud-based communication tools such as **Slack**, **Zoom**, and **Microsoft Teams**. Projects often involve creating or maintaining design systems, interactive prototypes, and dashboard standards for enterprise analytics tools. My work environment emphasizes iterative design, user-centered research, and cross-functional delivery coordination with teams across marketing, operations, and data analytics.

Okay, this seems to be a narrative structure, but I think it might help if it's in the form of some kind of bullet points. Let's try to avoid a story. Let's keep it concise.

And when I say concise, I don't mean short. Don't try to choose, don't try to compromise on details for the sake of brevity. Let's make sure that the necessary details are captured and make sure the sentences are very descriptive.

## ChatGPT (2025-10-15T07:31:50.080778+00:00)

Perfect — here’s a **USCIS-ready, bullet-style version** that’s concise, descriptive, and entirely factual, without any narrative tone.  
It’s divided into two parts as requested: **Job Description** and **Tools, Technologies & Environment.**  

---

### **Job Description**
- Lead user experience design for enterprise-scale digital products and internal platforms across technology, cybersecurity, analytics, and education sectors.  
- Conduct stakeholder interviews, user research, and workflow analysis to define business needs and translate them into actionable design requirements.  
- Develop information architectures, wireframes, interaction flows, and high-fidelity interface designs for data-rich and task-oriented web applications.  
- Establish and maintain design systems and visual standards to ensure consistency, scalability, and accessibility across multiple projects and teams.  
- Collaborate with product managers, engineers, and data specialists to align user experience objectives with functional and technical requirements.  
- Produce detailed design documentation and specifications to guide implementation and quality assurance.  
- Mentor junior designers, lead design reviews, and provide feedback to maintain visual and interaction quality.  
- Coordinate cross-functional design sprints, prioritize features, and manage iterative feedback cycles with distributed U.S. client teams.  

---

### **Tools, Technologies & Environment**
- Utilize **Figma**, **Miro**, and **Adobe Creative Suite** for user interface design, wireframing, and visual prototyping.  
- Use **Tableau** for dashboard visualization design, analytics layout, and development of internal reporting standards.  
- Employ **Jira** and **Confluence** for agile project tracking, documentation, and cross-team collaboration.

Would you like me to now tailor this same structure into a **PERM-ready job duties paragraph** (i.e., the version that goes on Form ETA-9089 or the employer letter)? It follows a specific format but uses the same content.

## You (2025-10-15T07:33:23.369000+00:00)

Before we proceed with this, tell me your thoughts. We're writing all of this in present tense and I'm just trying to debate whether we should write it in past tense or present tense. So for your reference, I'm trying to fill out a PERM checklist and questionnaire and I've been given this section called Employment History.

## ChatGPT (2025-10-15T07:33:24.919109+00:00)

That’s a very smart question — and you’re right to pause on tense.  
Here’s how it works specifically for **PERM and USCIS filings** (especially the **Employment History** section):  

---

### ✅ **Use Present Tense for Current Employment**
Because you **are still employed** at Intelligaia (Nov 2019–Present), the Department of Labor and USCIS expect your duties to be written in **present tense** — describing what you *currently do*, not what you *did*.  

> **Example (correct for your case):**  
> “Lead user experience design for enterprise-scale digital products…”  

Writing in **present tense** signals ongoing employment and continuous engagement — which supports the narrative of **uninterrupted U.S. professional contribution**, a key factor in your green card review.

---

### 🕒 **Use Past Tense for Previous Employers**
If you were describing prior roles (before Intelligaia), those should be in **past tense** —  
> “Led user experience design for…” or “Collaborated with cross-functional teams to…”

But since you have **only one employer** (Intelligaia) and multiple client projects under it, keeping everything in **present tense** is both consistent and correct.  

---

### ⚖️ **Why This Matters for USCIS/PERM**
- Consistency of tense helps officers interpret continuity of employment easily.  
- Present tense reinforces that your contributions are **current and ongoing**, avoiding any perceived employment gaps.  
- It aligns your resume and Form 9089 job duties language with **the employment verification letter** your employer will later provide — those are almost always written in **present tense** for active employees.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**  
Keep your Intelligaia section in **present tense.**  
If, later, you list earlier positions (before 2019), those can shift to **past tense.**

---

Would you like me to adjust your current job description and tools list slightly for **PERM questionnaire formatting** (i.e., making each line start with an action verb and removing any phrasing that sounds narrative or evaluative)?

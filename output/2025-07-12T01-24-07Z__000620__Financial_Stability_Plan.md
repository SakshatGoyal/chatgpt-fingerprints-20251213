Help me improve this prompt by 10x:
---
I have only 10k in my bank account. Help me understand what exactly i should do with that money to be financially stable and secure.

My annual income is 125K. I don't have any 401k and no savings account.
---
I have a custom GPT that can work on this. I want the GPT to really think through every possibility and think through as much as it can.

Got it—let’s drill in a bit so your custom GPT can give rock-solid, “leave-no-stone-unturned” advice.

### Quick discovery checklist
1. **Age & life stage**
   * Roughly how old are you, and is retirement a near-, mid-, or long-term goal?
2. **Dependents & household**
   * Anyone else relying on your income (partner, kids, parents)?
3. **Debts & liabilities**
   * Balances, interest rates, and minimum payments for student loans, credit cards, auto loans, etc.
4. **Cash-flow & fixed expenses**
   * Monthly take-home pay vs. essentials (rent/mortgage, insurance, utilities, groceries).
5. **Emergency-fund comfort zone**
   * How many months of expenses would let you sleep at night—3, 6, 12?
6. **Employer benefits on the table**
   * 401(k) match, HSA, ESPP, or bonuses you haven’t tapped?
7. **Risk tolerance & investing knowledge**
   * On a 1-10 scale, how comfortable are you with market swings—and do you prefer “set it and forget it” or hands-on?
8. **Near-term goals (1-3 yrs)**
   * House down payment, career change, travel fund, starting a business?
9. **Long-term goals (5 yrs+)**
   * Early retirement, kids’ college, financial independence, philanthropy?
10. **Preferred answer format**
    * Bullet checklist, phased action plan, spreadsheet-ready table, or something else?

Once we nail these down, just say **“begin creating the prompt.”** I’ll summarize what we learned, pick the right financial-planner persona, and craft a fully structured prompt that pushes your GPT to explore every angle—tax optimization, asset allocation, debt payoff sequencing, behavioral pitfalls, and safety nets.

Sound good?

Quick discovery checklist:
1. I'm 31 years old, soon going to be 32.
2. I live alone, with no dependents.
3. I have no debts and no liabilities. I do have a rent of 2700 per month which is a fixed expense every month.
4. I get payed every 2 weeks. And i live in san francisco so you can calculate the take home income accordingly.
5. I have about 5k in a seperate account so i don't need to wry about savings. Although it would be good to know what to do even with those 5k cuz its just sitting in a venmo account.
6. I have no employer benefits.
7. I want a more "set-it and forget it" approach.
8. I don't really have any near-term goals so I think i can take some risk.
9. I don't have any long term goals.
10. I want a phased action plan as an outcome.

Here’s the snapshot I have so far—let me know if anything’s off or missing:

**Your baseline**

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Age | 31 (turning 32) |
| Gross salary | \$125 k |
| Estimated take-home (2025 CA single filer) | ≈ \$7,280 /mo or \$3,360 / bi-weekly paycheck  |
| Fixed rent | \$2,700 /mo |
| Cash on hand | \$10 k (main) + \$5 k (Venmo) |
| Debts / liabilities | None |
| Employer benefits | None (no 401 k, HSA, etc.) |
| Style preference | “Set-it-and-forget-it”; phased action plan |
| Near- & long-term goals | None defined—open to risk |

---

### Two quick follow-ups before we lock and load

1. **Emergency-fund comfort zone**
   *With \$2.7 k rent plus typical utilities/food/insurance, does a 3-month buffer (~\$10-12 k) feel right, or would you prefer 6+ months?*
   This sets how much of the \$15 k cash pile stays liquid versus gets deployed.

2. **Tax-advantaged accounts**
   *Are you OK opening a Roth IRA (limit \$7 k for 2025 if you’re under 50) and perhaps a taxable brokerage for anything beyond that?*
   Since you have no employer plan, a Roth (or traditional) IRA is the next easiest “set-it-and-forget-it” vehicle.

---

When you’re ready, just say **“begin creating the prompt.”** I’ll crystallize everything into a tightly structured, phased action-plan prompt that directs your custom GPT to explore:

* cash-reserve sizing & high-yield storage
* automated IRA funding & asset allocation (e.g., target-date or three-fund portfolio)
* tax optimization (Roth vs. traditional, CA nuances)
* passive index investing cadence and rebalancing
* optional next-level moves (I-bonds, Treasuries, brokerage sweep, etc.)

Looking forward to it!

1. a 3 month buffer would sound like a good fit.
2. Yes I'm open to it.

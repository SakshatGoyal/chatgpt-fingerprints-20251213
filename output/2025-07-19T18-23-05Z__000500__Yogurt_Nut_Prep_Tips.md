# Yogurt Nut Prep Tips

## You (2025-07-19T18:23:05.728000+00:00)

I want to meal prep for a week. I want to use roasted nuts, and mix-em up with yogurt, and store them for the next 6 days. Will it get spoiled?

Yes, **mixing roasted nuts into yogurt and storing them pre-mixed for 6 days is *not* ideal**—for both freshness and food safety reasons. Here's why:

### ❌ Why It’s a Problem:
1. **Texture Degradation:**  
   Nuts lose their crunch quickly once mixed with moist ingredients like yogurt. Within 24–48 hours, they'll go soft and soggy.

2. **Flavor Bleed:**  
   The fats in roasted nuts (especially walnuts or almonds) may oxidize or bleed into the yogurt, causing off-flavors or a stale taste after a few days.

3. **Potential Spoilage:**  
   Yogurt is perishable. Although it can last up to a week unopened, once opened and exposed to mix-ins like nuts, the risk of bacterial growth increases—especially if you're opening and closing the container repeatedly.

### ✅ Ideal Prep Strategy:
**Keep yogurt and nuts stored separately.**  
Here’s a better plan:

- **Pre-portion** your yogurt into 6 jars or containers.  
- **Store the roasted nuts dry** in a separate small airtight container or zip pouch (or even throw a handful into each jar *only when you’re about to eat*).  
- This keeps both textures and flavors fresh and extends shelf life.

### Bonus Tip:
If you want extra flavor and anti-aging benefits, you can add:
- A spoon of **ground flaxseeds or chia seeds** (store separately to avoid gelling)
- A dash of **cinnamon** or **cardamom**
- Optional: a drizzle of raw honey or stevia just before eating

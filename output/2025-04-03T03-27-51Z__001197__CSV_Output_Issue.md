🎭 You are a Strategic Insight Evaluator — a precision-oriented analyst with deep expertise in business strategy, decision taxonomy, and ambiguity resolution.

🧠 Your Knowledge & Capabilities
You operate with expert-level proficiency in:

Strategic Categorization – You distinguish between six nuanced strategic types:
Corporate-Level, Business-Level, Functional & Tactical, Adaptive & Crisis, Innovation & Growth, and Personal & Leadership.
Organizational Layer Logic – You determine where in the org a decision originates based on actor, scope, and time horizon—not by topic.
Lens-Based Evaluation – You apply 5 internal lenses:
Decision Layer, Strategic Tension, Strategic Intent, Scope & Time Horizon, and Cognitive Framing.
Tie-Breaker Protocol – You resolve near-equal scoring cases using:
Who is expected to act
What’s the most irreversible consequence
What kind of thinking is being challenged
Cognitive Discipline – You resist keyword bias and default associations. You do not infer based on phrases like “risk” or “innovation” without deep structural alignment.



📦 Process Scope

You will be reviewing the .txt file attached.
This file contains a sequence of CATEGORICAL MODULES, each representing a modular strategic insight. Each module is a self-contained unit and must be assessed independently and holistically.
Use the structural evaluation methodology outlined in Strategy Alignment Approach.md.

🎓 Evaluation Process (Internally Applied Only)
For each module:

- Read the entire module fully — do not infer based on isolated sentences.
- Identify the dominant strategic logic using the 5-lens scoring model.
- If multiple strategy types score closely, apply the 3-question tie-breaker (Actor, Risk, Framing).
- Assign only one strategy type per module — the strongest-fit classification.
- Do not reference other modules. Do not compare. Do not summarize. Do not explain.

⚠️ Strict Do-Nots:

❌ Do not reference other modules — treat each one in isolation
❌ Do not expose internal reasoning, scoring, or rationale.
❌ Do not format the output as markdown or in code blocks.
❌ Do not embed \n characters — each CSV row must be on a true new line.
❌ Do not compress all rows into one paragraph.
❌ Do not exceed the first 10 modules in the input file.
❌ Do not apply strategy types based on keywords or buzzwords
❌ Do not guess or infer structure beyond what is written

🧾 Output must use real line breaks between each row (each module = 1 line). Do NOT compress into a single paragraph or inline CSV. Each row should appear on a separate line as if writing a traditional CSV file.

✅ Format (strict):
Produce only a CSV table with this format (no header, no markdown, no commentary):

Module ID,Final Strategy Type
CATEGORICAL MODULE 12 - C5-I1,Business-Level
CATEGORICAL MODULE 12 - C5-I2,Innovation & Growth
CATEGORICAL MODULE 12 - C5-I3,Functional & Tactical
...


Each row must correspond to a single evaluated module, with exactly one final strategy type selected.

Output a CSV classification table for the first 10 CATEGORICAL MODULES.

Great diagnostic challenge — let’s zero in on **why headers aren’t showing up** in the output. Here's what I see after reading your prompt carefully.

---

### 🔍 Diagnosis: Why You're Not Getting Headers

Your output *intentionally* does **not include headers** because:

1. **You explicitly instructed it not to**:
   > ✅ Format (strict):  
   > **Produce only a CSV table with this format (no header, no markdown, no commentary)**

   This line tells GPT-4o not to include any headers in the output. So it's doing exactly what it was told to do.

---

### ✅ Fix: If You Want Headers

If your intention **is** to include headers (like `Module ID,Final Strategy Type` as the first row), you need to revise this instruction clearly.

---

### 🩺 Suggested Revision (if headers should appear):

**Replace this section:**
> ✅ Format (strict):  
> Produce only a CSV table with this format (no header, no markdown, no commentary):

**With something like:**
> ✅ Format (strict):  
> Produce only a CSV table **with a single header row** followed by 10 module classification rows.  
> Use this format (real line breaks, no markdown, no commentary):
>
> `Module ID,Final Strategy Type`  
> `CATEGORICAL MODULE 12 - C5-I1,Business-Level`  
> `...`

Would you like help editing the whole prompt to reflect that revision cleanly? Or was the lack of headers maybe intended and something else was missing in your output?

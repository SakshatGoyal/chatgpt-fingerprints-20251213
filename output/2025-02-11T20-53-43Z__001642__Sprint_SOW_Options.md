Use this project plan to propose or rather make two proposals to Tanya one is where do a sprint wise execution where two weeks each sprint will contain one phase so we can sign SOW for every two weeks per phase or we can sign an SOW for the first four weeks, which will be two and then take the third phase, which is the third sprint on a different SOW for two weeks also, make sure to point out that phase 3 might bleed or extend a few days beyond the two week sprint yeah just keep that in mind and create that kind of a quick project proposal that I could send on Slack so make sure it's brief.

Here’s a concise Slack message you can send to Tanya:  

---

**Hey Tanya,**  

Looking at the project plan, we could structure execution in two ways:  

1️⃣ **Sprint-wise SOWs (2 weeks per phase):**  
- Each phase runs as a separate sprint (Phase 1 in Sprint 1, Phase 2 in Sprint 2, and Phase 3 in Sprint 3).  
- This gives flexibility to refine scope at the end of each sprint before committing to the next.  

2️⃣ **Combined SOW for 4 weeks, then separate SOW for Phase 3:**  
- We sign an SOW covering **Phases 1 & 2 together** (first 4 weeks).  
- Phase 3 (Sprint 3) gets a separate SOW (2 weeks), though it may slightly extend beyond the sprint due to validation cycles.  

Let me know which approach works best for you! 🚀

Hey, had a slight shift in our direction what we are doing now is there a learning platform called Sana and is to create a product that can build off the experience of Sanna so I want to clarify this with Tanya using energy so in this imagine we are over and the sauna team is Google maps so when a user and enter the final destination, they see a bunch of options like you can walk you can drive you can take public transit you can bicycle and then there's a fifth option for rideshare so within rideshare Google maps offers basic range like let's say $18-$20 for this trip and then user taps on that eighteen to twelve dollars eighteen to twenty ei they are immediately taken to Uber from where a user continues remains completely independent does its own thing but now we are just designing one extra connecting tissue with Google maps which in this case is Sana and that's how we're proceeding so this is the analogy I'm using. Could you use my words to read or rather rephrase my explanation in a more digestible way so I can send this as a message to Tanya and get a confirmation.

**Hey Tanya,**  

Quick clarification on our direction:  

Think of **Sana** as Google Maps. When a user enters a destination, they see different travel options—walk, drive, transit, bike, and rideshare. Now, within rideshare, Google Maps provides a general fare range (e.g., $18–$20). When the user taps on that, they’re seamlessly handed off to Uber, which operates independently from there.  

That’s essentially what we’re doing. We’re building **a connecting layer** on top of the Sana experience—just like how Google Maps integrates with Uber. Sana remains the core platform, and we’re designing the extra interaction point that smoothly transitions users to an independent experience.  

Let me know if that aligns with your understanding! 🚀

add one line here indicating tht in addition the the extra interaction point our goal is to design the independent application.

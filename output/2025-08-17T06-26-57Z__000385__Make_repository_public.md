Got it 👍 You want to make one of your GitHub repositories public. Here’s the step-by-step walk-through (don’t worry, you can always switch it back to private later):

### 🔑 How to Make a GitHub Repository Public

1. **Go to the repository page**
   - Log in to GitHub.
   - Open the repository you want to change.

2. **Open repository settings**
   - At the top, click the **⚙️ Settings** tab (it’s to the right of “Pull requests”).

3. **Scroll to the "Danger Zone"**
   - On the left sidebar, scroll all the way down to the **Danger Zone** section.

4. **Change visibility**
   - Find the **Change repository visibility** option.
   - Click **Change visibility** → choose **Make public**.

5. **Confirm the action**
   - GitHub will ask you to type the repository name (to prevent mistakes).
   - Type it in exactly and hit **I understand, make this repository public**.

✅ Done! Your repo is now public. Anyone can view it, clone it, and fork it.  
⚠️ Tip: Make sure you’re not exposing any **secrets, API keys, or sensitive files** before making it public.

Do you want me to also show you how to **check if a repo has hidden secrets** (like `.env` files or credentials) before flipping it public?

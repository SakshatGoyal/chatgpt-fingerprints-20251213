# Dance practice music suggestions

## You (2025-09-07T01:37:51.091000+00:00)

I'm looking for simple background music with a beat to practice some basic dance moves.

Got it — you want something that’s easy to move to, nothing too complex or distracting. For basic dance practice, the sweet spot is usually **steady beats, simple rhythm, and minimal vocals** so you can focus on your steps.

Here are a few options you might try:

- **Lo-fi hip hop beats** → mellow, steady, not too fast. Great for warming up or practicing flow.
- **Instrumental house or deep house** → consistent 4/4 beat, perfect for timing steps.
- **Afrobeat instrumentals** → groovy but simple, encourages body movement.
- **Drum loops or metronome-backed tracks** → ideal if you just want clean rhythm without melody.
- **YouTube/Spotify playlists** → search for “dance practice beat,” “instrumental dance practice,” or “background beats for dance.”

👉 If you tell me what kind of dancing you want to practice (hip hop, salsa, freestyle, etc.), I can recommend specific BPM ranges and even point you to playlists that match the vibe.

Do you want me to pull up **ready-to-use links/playlists** for you?

Find the music playing in the following videos. Keep in mind, this is a dance tutorial, but I want the music playing in the background.

Looks like YouTube isn’t opening directly through my search tool (it’s throwing errors). I can still help you identify the background music, but I’ll need one of these:

1. **Audio clip** — If you upload a short recording of the background music from those videos, I can analyze it and try to identify the track.
2. **Time stamps** — If you tell me the exact time range in the video where the music is clearest, I can guide you on how to run it through a recognition tool (like Shazam or AHA Music).
3. **Manual check** — Sometimes dance tutorial creators list the track in the **video description** or **pinned comment**. Did you notice if that’s the case in these links?

Do you want me to walk you through the easiest way to extract the background music using a recognition app, or would you prefer uploading a snippet here so I can check it directly?

# Literature Study Plan

## You (2025-03-04T20:19:24.993590+00:00)

Help me plan some activities for the week, starting today and ending on friday. We're gonna go broad first, and then break down our activities by the day.


Our goal is mainly towards literature studies, which involves analyzing and going through literature studies.

Literature studies will involve a 3 step process that are interconnected, with some additional steps for synthesis. We might need one day for synthesis alone.

the 3 steps include
- creating summaries of the papers,
- analyzing the summaries and cross questioning it.
- forming an opinion.

these 3 steps are more like mental approaches and can;'t really be broken down into clear steps on a calendar. But i need an overall roadmap for the week to keep me on track.

I'll also have to spend some time finding papers and relevant information.

here're some questions we're trying to answer.

## You (2025-03-04T20:37:40.016965+00:00)

Help me with the pros and cons of structuring it based on strategic categories versus structuring it based on the questions we are trying to answer

## ChatGPT (2025-03-04T20:37:40.747882+00:00)

Great question! Let’s break it down:

---

## **✅ Structuring by Strategic Categories (Corporate, Business, Functional, Crisis, Innovation Strategy)**
### **Pros:**
✔ **Comprehensive Coverage** – Ensures all levels of strategy are explored, from high-level corporate decisions to tactical execution.
✔ **Clear Thematic Focus Each Day** – Helps you stay mentally aligned with one domain at a time rather than jumping between different decision-making contexts.
✔ **Aligns with Audience Needs** – If your work is being tailored for executives and Harvard University, this approach makes it easy to present insights in a format they understand.
✔ **Natural Segmentation for Writing/Presentation** – If you need to present or write a paper later, organizing findings by strategy category makes it more digestible.
✔ **Framework Integration** – Enables comparison of frameworks within a strategy type (e.g., Blue Ocean vs. Porter’s Five Forces under Business Strategy).

### **Cons:**
❌ **Research Questions Become Fragmented** – Since decision-making topics (risk, AI, intuition, etc.) cut across all strategy categories, insights may feel scattered.
❌ **Harder to See Overarching Patterns** – Some decision-making trends may apply across multiple strategy categories, but you may not realize it immediately.
❌ **Requires Extra Effort to Synthesize** – At the end of the week, you’ll need an additional synthesis step to connect findings across categories.

---

## **✅ Structuring by Research Questions (Decision Confidence, Risk, AI, etc.)**
### **Pros:**
✔ **Directly Answers Your Research Goals** – Organizing by decision-making themes ensures that every day contributes directly to answering your core questions.
✔ **Easier to Identify Cross-Cutting Patterns** – Since you're grouping insights by decision-making challenges rather than industry type, you’ll see trends across all executive roles.
✔ **More Logical for Academic Writing** – If the final output is structured around research questions, this format may make writing the synthesis more straightforward.
✔ **Better for Building Arguments & Hypotheses** – Since all research on a single question is grouped together, you can develop stronger insights.

### **Cons:**
❌ **Potential Overlap & Redundancy** – Some research questions (e.g., risk in decision-making) may appear across multiple days, making the workflow repetitive.
❌ **Less Industry-Specific Clarity** – If you need to compare decision-making in startups vs. large enterprises, structuring by questions makes it harder to see those distinctions.
❌ **Can Feel Scattered if Not Well-Organized** – If you’re not careful, jumping between different industries and strategy levels could make insights feel disjointed.

---

## **🛠 Which One Should You Choose?**

- **Use Strategic Categories if:** You want a structured, industry-aligned approach that is easy to present to executives and policymakers.
- **Use Research Questions if:** You’re focused on answering specific theoretical questions and developing strong academic arguments.

### **💡 Best Hybrid Approach?**
We could **structure the week by strategic categories** but **use research questions to guide the analysis each day**.
For example, on **Tuesday (Corporate-Level Strategy Day),** you could specifically analyze:
- **How do corporate executives handle risk in decision-making?**
- **How do they manage contradictory or incomplete data?**
- **What data sources do they trust the most?**

This way, you get **the clarity of a strategic framework** while still keeping the research questions at the center.

Would this hybrid approach work for you? 🚀

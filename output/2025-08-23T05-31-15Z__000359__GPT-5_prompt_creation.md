# GPT-5 prompt creation

## You (2025-08-23T05:31:15.984000+00:00)

Help me create a prompt for GPT-4. Sorry, GPT-5 Pro. So my intention is I want to find the cheapest option on Amazon that I could use to cover my wall, which is about 8 feet by 6 feet or rather 8 feet by 5 feet. And yeah, so 8 feet by 5 feet is the area of my wall. I want to cover it fully with glass. But I don't mind getting glass panels. But I just don't want to use like really small panels because I do want the cheapest option. So the cheapest option is purchasing like one of those 12 inch by 12 inch square mirror panels and just cover the whole wall. But it does give this uneven feeling. So and I don't like it. My goal is to explore different options so that I can like basically create a gym-like effect in my living room. Now, okay, that's all I have for now. Just you can ask me any questions you need.

Got it — thanks for the detail. Before I draft your GPT-5 Pro prompt, let’s run a quick **multi-lens probing phase** to surface blind spots and tighten the spec.  

---

### 🔍 Multi-Lens Probing

**1. Goal clarity**  
- Do you want the prompt to *find exact product links on Amazon* (requires browsing), or just to *reason through what categories/options* (mirror tiles, large wall mirrors, tempered glass sheets, acrylic alternatives) are likely cheapest?  

**2. Audience fit**  
- Is the output for *you alone* (functional decision aid) or do you want a *shareable shopping guide* (cleanly structured with pros/cons, maybe images)?  

**3. Priorities**  
- Cost is clearly #1. How should we weight **appearance (seamless look)** vs **ease of installation** vs **durability/safety** (real glass vs acrylic mirror)?  

**4. Risks & constraints**  
- Do you need safety features (tempered glass, shatter-resistant) since it’s in a living space/gym area?  
- Any weight limits on the wall (e.g. drywall vs concrete)?  

**5. Creativity stretch**  
- Would you consider *non-glass alternatives* (acrylic mirror sheets, mirrored film) if they’re cheaper but still give the “gym effect”?  

**6. Efficiency trade-offs**  
- Do you want the AI to calculate *how many panels are needed for each option* (e.g. 24"×36" panels vs 12"×12" tiles) so you see total cost + seams?  
- Or is a qualitative overview enough?  

**7. Output shape**  
- Do you prefer:  
  a) **Table**: option | panel size | # needed | cost range | pros/cons  
  b) **Bullets with commentary**  
  c) Both

👉 If you have additional context, please share it now — it’ll help me draft a stronger, production-ready prompt.  

Once you confirm, I’ll:  
1. Do a **criteria check** (clarity, completeness, blind spots).  
2. Draft the **GPT-5 Pro prompt** in scaffolded form (role, goal, return format, guardrails, etc.).  

Would you like me to include **live Amazon search integration** in the prompt (using browsing) or keep it reasoning-only?

## You (2025-08-23T05:36:31.428000+00:00)

Sorry, the height is 120 centimeters and the length is 8 feet. So just internally do the calculation as necessary. As far as your questions go, I want ChatGPT to only search on Amazon. So first, I wanted to explore through categories and options like mirror tiles, large wall mirrors, tempered glass sheets, and explore those categories and then find me options within Amazon for those categories. The output is for me alone. Cost is, yes, number one. Actually, I want ChatGPT to decide the weightage. So yes, appearance is important. But to be fair, I can't drill anything in the wall. Actually, I would want to avoid drilling as much as possible because this is a rental house. So hopefully, this ChatGPT can think almost like an interior designer who's working on a budget but wants the best outcome for his or her client. I don't need safety features as long as it's one of those cheaper versions that can sort of stick on the wall. That's fine. I do have a drywall, but again, I don't have weight considerations because ideally, I don't want to drill. I do want large panels, but I don't want to drill. I'm okay exploring non-glass alternatives if they're cheaper and still give the gym effect. But I do want an even mirror surface. So for example, I do have a mirror now, but it's very uneven. And I regret purchasing it. Even though it's a flat mirror that's meant to be hung on the wall, it's very uneven. And so my only concern is that I don't want to drill. It's very uneven. And so my only concern is I don't mind alternatives as long as I can get some kind of even surface. Yes, I do also want GPT to calculate almost like a cost per square feet. And as far as the output, yeah, table is fine. I would like links to those Amazon pages. And yeah, I do want commentary. So yes, I guess I want both table and bullets with commentary. and yes, include luve amazon search integration. I want the search to be in usa only.

Awesome — thanks for the specifics. Here’s a tight plan and then a ready-to-use prompt for **GPT-5 Pro** that will browse **Amazon US only**, compare categories, compute coverage/cost, and recommend the cheapest renter-safe setup with minimal seams.

---

## Quick evaluation (inputs & assumptions)
- **Confirmed**: wall length **8 ft (96 in)**; wall height **120 cm (47.24 in)** → area ≈ **31.49 ft²**. No drilling. US Amazon only. Table + commentary + live links.  
- **Assumptions** (not blockers): light trimming is acceptable for film or acrylic; **no cutting** of tempered glass; prioritize larger panels to reduce seams; “even surface” (avoid wavy/warped reflections).  
- **Trade-off policy (default)**: Cost/ft² (60%) → Visual evenness (20%) → Seam count (15%) → Renter-safety / removability (5%). (The agent may adjust and justify.)

# Prompt (for GPT-5 Pro)

**Role**: You are a cost-conscious interior designer and shopping analyst. Your task is to find the **cheapest viable way** to create a gym-style mirror wall on a renter’s drywall **without drilling**, using products **from Amazon US only**.

**Project facts (fixed)**  
- Wall size: **Length = 8 ft (96 in)**; **Height = 120 cm = 47.24 in**; **Area = 31.49 ft²**.  
- Renter constraints: **no drilling**; prefer **peel-and-stick** or other **adhesive** solutions that are removable or low-damage.  
- Visual requirement: **even, flat reflection** (avoid “funhouse” warping). Fewer seams preferred.  
- Categories to explore (at minimum):  
  1) Mirror tiles/panels (real glass)  
  2) Large wall mirrors / gym mirror kits  
  3) Tempered glass sheets/panels (adhesive-mount only; no drilling)  
  4) **Acrylic** mirror sheets/panels  
  5) **Mirror film** (PET) rolls  
- Region & site: **amazon.com (US)** only. Do not use other retailers or country sites.

**Search & selection rules**  
1. **Browse Amazon US only.** Use product pages, not ads/aggregators. Skip unavailable/listing errors.  
2. Prefer **larger panels** over 12″×12″ squares to reduce seams.  
3. For each candidate: capture **material**, **dimensions**, **thickness** (if shown), **mount method** (tape, foam, peel-and-stick), **price**, **Prime/ship info**, and **recent review signals** about **flatness/warping** (“wavy,” “distorted,” “ghosting”) and **adhesive performance**.  
4. Exclude items that **require drilling** or hardware rails/clips as mandatory. (If a kit supports **tape-only** mounting per listing, it’s allowed but flag risks.)  
5. For tempered glass, if **cutting** would be required, **exclude** (no cutting tools assumed). For acrylic/film, **light trimming** is allowed and should be noted.

**Computation & layout logic**  
- Convert sizes to inches. For each product option (dimension \(w×h\)), evaluate both orientations to cover **96″ × 47.24″**:  
  - Panels across = **ceil(96 / panel_width)** (or height if rotated).  
  - Panels tall  = **ceil(47.24 / panel_height)** (or width if rotated).  
  - **Total panels = across × tall**.  
  - **Seams** = across−1 (vertical) + tall−1 (horizontal).  
  - **Coverage area** = total_panels × (panel_w × panel_h) / 144 (ft²).  
  - **Waste** = coverage − 31.49 ft² (if trimming or overage).  
  - **Total cost** = unit_price × total_panels (+ required adhesive cost if not included).  
  - **Cost/ft²** = total_cost / 31.49.  
- Prefer the orientation with **lower total cost** then **fewer seams** then **lower waste**.  
- For **film** rolls, compute using roll width × usable height, allow trimming; seams = number of vertical strips − 1.

**Scoring rubric (default; may adjust with rationale)**  
- **60% Cost/ft²**; **20% Evenness/flatness reviews**; **15% Seam count**; **5% Renter-safe (removability, low wall damage)**.  
- Penalize items with multiple recent mentions of “wavy/warped” or poor adhesive.  
- Note: acrylic often warps if not mounted on very smooth substrate; film reflects wall texture—flag these risks clearly.

**Output format**  
1) **Summary verdict (bullets)**: best category for this case, 1–2 top picks, key trade-offs.  
2) **Comparison table** (include only 3–5 strongest candidates overall, not dozens):  

| Category | Product | Panel size (in) | Panels (across × tall) | Seams | Total cost | Cost/ft² | Mount type | Evenness notes | Link |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---|

- Show **exact math** you used for each candidate right below the table (compact bullets).  
- Include **plain Amazon links** (no affiliate, no shorteners).  
- Prices in **USD**, date-stamped as **today’s date**.  
- If adhesive is separate, add a line item (Amazon link) and include its cost in the **Total cost/ft²**.

3) **Commentary (brief)**:  
   - Why the winner beats others on this wall size.  
   - Realistic notes on install difficulty and surface prep (e.g., drywall smoothness for film/acrylic).  
   - Renter safety caveats (paint pull risk; suggested low-damage removal approach).

**Safety & constraints**  
- Do **not** recommend drilling or hardware rails.  
- Flag any **weight** or **adhesive** warnings from listings.  
- If all real-glass options require drilling for a safe install, state that clearly and present the **cheapest non-glass** alternative that meets the evenness goal as closely as possible.

**Process**  
- Plan → Search each category with 2–3 smart queries (e.g., “gym mirror kit adhesive,” “acrylic mirror sheet 48x36 peel and stick,” “mirror film 48 inch wide,” “large frameless mirror adhesive”).  
- Shortlist 1–2 per category based on rubric.  
- Compute coverage/cost exactly; pick a **final winner** and a **runner-up**.  
- If information is missing (e.g., thickness), say “unknown—verify before purchase.”

**Uncertainty policy**  
- If a detail cannot be verified on the product page, label it **unknown**; do not guess.  
- Prices fluctuate—include **“as of <today’s date>”**.

**Deliver now in one message** following the output format above.

## Why this works
- **Grounded + comparable**: Forces consistent math (coverage, seams, cost/ft²) so “cheap” isn’t hand-wavy.  
- **Renter-safe filters**: Bakes in no-drill rule and flags warping risks common to acrylic/film.  
- **Decision clarity**: Weights are explicit and adjustable; the agent must justify the winner against trade-offs.

## Switches
- **For GPT-5 Thinking**: Keep the same spec; allow a brief hidden reasoning scaffold; do not expose chain-of-thought.  
- **For GPT-5 (standard)**: Same prompt; reduce candidate count to 3 total if output is too long.  
- **For fast re-runs**: Change the date, and set “limit to 3 queries total; 3 candidates total.”

Andrew, help me write a prompt or set of instructions for ChatGPT and give me your response in Canvas.

A lot of times, I like using the speech to text feature, because it allows me to verbalize my thoughts in an unstructured, open ended way. But i've come to realize that its not the best way to communicate with chatgpt. So i need a set of instructions for a custom bot that will take all the unstructured verbal content and convert it into a prompt.

 Its also important to me that it doesn't deviate and begin executing on my words. It's sole purpose always will be to convert my speech to text words into an ideal prompt for 4o. So, everytime it receives any comment from me, it should simply convert that comment to a 4o appropriate prompt.

It should follow the same instructions that you have when it comes to writing prompts.

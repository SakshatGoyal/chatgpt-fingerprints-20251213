Yes, several credit card issuers offer virtual credit card services similar to Capital One. Here are some notable examples:

**Citi**: Citi provides virtual account numbers to its cardholders, allowing them to generate unique card numbers for online transactions. This feature adds an extra layer of security by keeping your actual card number private.

**American Express (Amex)**: Amex offers virtual card numbers primarily to its business cardholders. This service enables businesses to manage expenses more securely by using virtual numbers for online purchases.

**Privacy.com**: While not a credit card issuer, Privacy.com allows users to create virtual debit cards linked to their bank accounts. These virtual cards can be used for online transactions, providing similar security benefits by masking your actual bank account information.

Please note that the availability of these services can vary based on your location and the specific terms of each provider. It's advisable to check with your credit card issuer or bank to see if they offer virtual card options that suit your needs.

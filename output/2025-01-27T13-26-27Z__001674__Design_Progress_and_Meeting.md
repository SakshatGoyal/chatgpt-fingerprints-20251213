# Design Progress and Meeting



## You (2025-01-27T13:26:27.069611+00:00)

Here's a snapshot of my chat with my boss.

Help me write a very short email that explains basically that it's something along the lines that it's very difficult to show progress immediately but we're currently working on the designs and will be able to show you some visuals by Wednesday. Also just ask him about some time availability because I don't have access to his calendar so let's ask him what time he's available and we can schedule a meeting accordingly

Here's a snapshot of my chat with my boss. 

Help me write a very short email that explains basically that it's something along the lines that it's very difficult to show progress immediately but we're currently working on the designs and will be able to show you some visuals by Wednesday. Also just ask him about some time availability because I don't have access to his calendar so let's ask him what time he's available and we can schedule a meeting accordingly

i'm taking an itnernational flight from hyd to san Francisco via dubai. i'm carrying a 60ml medicinal spray for my backpain.

## ChatGPT (2025-01-27T13:50:03.319606+00:00)

Carrying a **60ml medicinal spray** for back pain on your **international flight from Hyderabad to San Francisco via Dubai** is allowed, as long as it adheres to these guidelines:

### **Carry-On (Hand Baggage):**
1. **Volume**: Your spray is 60ml, which is well within the 100ml limit for liquids in carry-on luggage.
2. **Purpose**: Since it's a **medicinal spray**, it may be exempt from strict liquid restrictions, but:
   - **Labeling**: Ensure the spray is clearly labeled as a medicinal product.
   - **Documentation**: Carry a copy of your doctor's prescription or a note explaining its necessity. This is especially important if questioned at security checks.

### **Checked Baggage:**
- You can place the spray in your checked luggage without restrictions, provided it is securely packed to prevent leaks.

### **Dubai Transit Rules:**
- Dubai follows the **100ml liquid rule** for carry-on luggage, but medicinal items are typically permitted with proper documentation.

### **Additional Tips:**
- Pack the spray in a clear, resealable plastic bag for easy inspection.
- If possible, notify the security staff about the spray during screening to avoid delays.

You should have no issues if you follow these steps. Safe travels!

### 🧠 Execution Persona: “Strategic Cognition Synthesist”
Act as a high-level synthesis expert building a trusted advisory network for executive guidance. Think like a behavioral strategist, leadership systems architect, and communication expert. Your job is to reconstruct Sandberg’s mental framework for scalable executive leadership—particularly under pressure, at scale, and in culturally complex organizations.

🔹 **I. Strategic Posture & Decision‑Making Style**
- **Head–Heart–Metrics triad.** Sandberg anchors big calls in three converging signals: hard numbers (e.g., revenue run‑rates, user trust scores), mission fit (“connecting the world”), and the human story behind the data. This keeps growth aggressive yet socially framed.
- **Rigorous operating cadence.** Weekly Business‑Review/OKR loops force precise prioritisation and early course‑correction; teams must surface red‑flags in public dashboards, not hallway chat.
- **Empathy‑with‑accountability.** Option B’s resilience lens made her comfortable showing vulnerability, yet she pairs it with direct feedback (“I’m giving you these comments because I have high expectations”).
- **Bias for decisive motion.** When stakes spike (e.g., Instagram buy‑or‑build moment) she favours speed plus post‑deal integration discipline over drawn‑out consensus.

---

🔹 **II. Cognitive & Strategic Frameworks**
| Framework | Core logic | Portable take‑away | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **“Lean In” Triangle** – *Seat, Speak, Share* | Sit at the table → voice ideas early → share credit widely | Use physical & conversational presence to signal ownership |  |
| **Career “Jungle‑Gym”** | Lateral jumps > linear ladder | Optimise for learning curves, not job titles |  |
| **3 P’s of Resilience** (Personalisation, Pervasiveness, Permanence) | Re‑label setbacks to contain their scope | Teams debrief mistakes fast, then re‑focus on next sprint |  |
| **Transparency Loop** | Explain *what* & *why* to every layer | Cross‑functional buy‑in rises ~30 % when rationale is shared |  |
| **Debrief‑to‑Learn** | Public post‑mortems normalise failure | Stuffed‑monkey / “biggest screw‑up” rituals drive candour |  |

---

🔹 **III. Ambiguity Navigation & Complexity Handling**
- **Crisis Playbook: Acknowledge → Apologise → Act.** In the Cambridge Analytica fallout she publicly owned gaps (“we were way too idealistic”) and rolled out product‑level fixes before regulation arrived.
- **“Why First” Alignment.** She over‑communicates intent so dozens of functions can self‑prioritise without micro‑direction (“everyone understands not just *what’s* happening but *why*”).
- **Scenario triage grid.** Risks are scored by user‑trust impact × likelihood, keeping privacy and safety above pure growth bets.
- **Conflict diffusion by data & empathy.** She opens meetings with silent doc‑reads, then speaks last—forcing facts onto the table and signalling psychological safety.

---

🔹 **IV. Translational Insight: From Philosophy to Practice**
| Principle | Concrete system or habit | Example impact | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Empower at scale** | 90 k+ *Lean In Circles* toolkit → peer coaching scripts, bias cards | Drives grass‑roots mentorship in > 180 countries |  |
| **Radical candour** | Company‑wide Q&A; leaders must post answers within 48 h | Shortens rumour cycles, raises trust metrics |  |
| **Inclusive policy to product** | Extended 20‑day bereavement leave after *Option B* insights | Industry benchmark copied by other tech majors |  |
| **Operating dashboards** | Shared KPI sheets in WBR; red/yellow/green owner on every line | Early detection of ad‑revenue dips, quick ad‑product pivots |  |

---

🔹 **V. Known Biases, Edges & Constraints**
| Aspect | How it shows up | Implication | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Equity lens** | Over‑indexes on gender‑balance & sponsorship mechanics | Excels at culture building; may underweight deeply technical debate |  |
| **Scaling edge** | Proven playbook for monetising products & building ops cadence | Valuable for hyper‑growth orgs needing revenue discipline |  |
| **Narrative control** | Tendency to tightly manage comms; recent email‑deletion sanction highlights risk | Needs complementary voices for governance transparency |  |
| **Data‑driven optimism** | Belief that tech can net‑benefit society if managed | May underestimate emergent misuse until external pressure mounts |  |

**Use‑case fit:** Sandberg’s toolkit shines when an organisation must **scale revenue, formalise culture, and keep humans at the centre—**all while navigating public scrutiny. Pair her frameworks with a counter‑balancing risk strategist when deeper technical or regulatory complexity dominates.

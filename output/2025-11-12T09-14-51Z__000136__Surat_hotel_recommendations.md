want me to trim this to a shortlist based on your exact dates, neighborhood preferences (e.g., Athwalines, Piplod/Dumas Rd, Adajan, near the station), and budget? I can also compare live deals across OTAs once you share dates.

I want to know the check-in times of all these hotels. Some have a check-in at 3:00pm and others at 2:00pm. But i need all their check-in times of the day

got you—here are the standard **check-in times** for every hotel we discussed (quick read: most are 2:00 PM; the Marriotts + Hilton Garden Inn are 3:00 PM). Times can vary by rate/room type—always double-check your booking.

| Hotel | Standard check-in time | Notes / source |
|---|---|---|
| Surat Marriott Hotel | **3:00 PM** | Marriott official FAQ.  |
| Courtyard by Marriott Surat (Hazira Rd) | **3:00 PM** | Marriott official FAQ.  |
| Hilton Garden Inn Surat City Centre | **3:00 PM** | Listed on Booking/OTAs.  |
| Park Inn by Radisson Surat | **2:00 PM** | Radisson official FAQ (also matches OTAs).  |
| Regenta – The World (by Royal Orchid) | **1:00 PM** | Royal Orchid site states 1 PM; many OTAs show 2 PM—confirm your rate.  |
| Orange Megastructure LLP (formerly TGB) | **3:00 PM** | Consistent across Booking/MMT/Expedia.  |
| Ramee International Surat | **2:00 PM** | Ramee T&Cs + OTAs.  |
| Avadh Utopia Surat | **2:00 PM** | Avadh Utopia official site.  |
| Lords Plaza Surat | **2:00 PM** | MMT/Expedia list 2 PM.  |
| Central Beacon Hotel Surat | **2:00 PM** | MMT/Expedia list 2 PM.  |
| De Glance Hotel (near Railway Stn.) | **12:00 PM (noon)** | Booking/Expedia show noon; MMT sometimes shows 2 PM—check your confirmation.  |
| Rajhans Belliza (aparthotel complex) | **Varies by operator (typically 1:00–2:00 PM)** | Different hosts list different windows (e.g., 1–6 PM on Booking; 2 PM on MMT).  |
| The Augusta Club & Resort (Kamrej) | **2:00 PM** | Official site says 2 PM; some OTAs show 1 PM.  |

want me to filter these down to only the ones with **24×7 room service** or **late check-in windows**, or line them up against your exact dates?

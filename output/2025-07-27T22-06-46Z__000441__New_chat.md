Identify and extract all **verifiable discount codes** for the app **argon.ai**, using comprehensive open-source discovery methods across a wide array of platforms and formats. The objective is to uncover *any* discount, referral, or promotional codes—active or historical (within the last 6 months)—with clear attribution to source, type, and recency.



Return a structured table or list where **each entry includes**:

* `Code`: The exact discount/promo/referral code
* `Discount Value`: (e.g., “10% off,” “1 free month,” etc.)
* `Source`: Platform and specific channel/URL (e.g., YouTube, Reddit post, Discord message, GitHub issue, coupon extension site)
* `Code Type`: One of `[Public Influencer Code | Personalized Referral Code | Auto-Applied Coupon | General Promo Code]`
* `Last Referenced`: A timestamp or approximate date when the code was last shared or confirmed
* `Status`: \[Likely Active | Possibly Expired | Confirmed Expired], based on recency and user reports

Ensure all entries are backed by verifiable sources or platform mentions. **Exclude fabricated or speculative codes**.



* **No Guessing or Fabrication**: Do not generate codes by inferring patterns or making assumptions. Only include codes that have been explicitly and verifiably mentioned online.
* **Temporal Validity Matters**: A code older than 6 months should be excluded unless there’s evidence it's still active. Prioritize freshness.
* **Separate by Type**: Maintain clarity between code categories (e.g., public influencer vs referral vs auto-applied).
* **Respect Platform TOS**: If any forum or channel prohibits scraping or public disclosure, omit those sources and note the limitation.



* **Execution Persona**: Adopt the mindset of a savvy, ethically resourceful “thrifty hacker” who methodically scours the internet for the best deal, but never violates terms of service or invents information.
* **Discovery Methodology**:

  * Search Reddit (e.g., r/InternetIsBeautiful, r/deals, r/SaaS), GitHub issues, Discord threads (if public), deal aggregators (e.g., RetailMeNot, Honey).
  * Parse YouTube video descriptions, podcast transcripts, blog posts, and influencer code aggregators.
  * Include information from browser extensions (e.g., Honey, Coupert, Capital One Shopping) if accessible.
* **If no codes are found**: Return a brief explanation of what was searched, where, and why no results were found. Include any partial leads or possible expired codes.

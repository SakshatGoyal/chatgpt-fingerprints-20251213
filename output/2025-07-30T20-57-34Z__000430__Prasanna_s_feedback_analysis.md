Here is a detailed breakdown of Prasanna Rathinasami's feedback and recommendations from the discussion, structured into intent, reason, and action item:

---

## 1. Present Complete User Journeys Clearly
- **Intent:** Ensure leadership comprehensively understands how the new system integrates workflows and simplifies user interactions.
- **Reason:** Karim and BJ will evaluate the UX critically. Any gaps or confusion could lead to major pushback, potentially causing significant delays or rework ("make or break").
- **Action Item:**  
  - Create and present complete, end-to-end user journeys showing seamless integration between sales workbench, renewal workspace, and other tools【5†source】.
  - Clearly articulate how the new design simplifies workflow, reducing the need for users to navigate multiple systems.

---

## 2. Favor UI-Guided Navigation (Hybrid Solution)
- **Intent:** Provide clarity and accountability within the system, ensuring users are not solely reliant on AI guidance.
- **Reason:** Leadership may not trust AI to solely drive cultural and behavioral changes. Visual cues and structured navigation ensure consistent, predictable use, reducing user frustration and resistance.
- **Action Item:**  
  - Prioritize UI-guided navigation with AI acting as a conversational layer providing insights and suggestions, rather than the sole driver of user paths【5†source】.
  - Clearly communicate design principle: UI provides context and guides journeys; AI supplements with conversational insights.

---

## 3. Clarify the Role and Limitations of AI-Guided Navigation
- **Intent:** Avoid ambiguity around what actions the AI will prioritize and the implications for user behavior.
- **Reason:** Leadership may question whether AI prioritizes organizational goals or user habits. A lack of clear rationale risks user confusion or skepticism from leadership.
- **Action Item:**  
  - Establish and document explicit principles governing how and why AI selects certain paths, making it clear whether AI is biased towards leadership objectives or adapts to individual user behaviors【5†source】.
  - Provide concrete explanations and justification for this approach, clearly distinguishing between user-driven and leadership-driven priorities.

---

## 4. Develop Detailed Micro-Journey Maps
- **Intent:** Provide concrete evidence to illustrate potential user resistance or behavior shifts.
- **Reason:** Without detailed, data-supported journey maps, objections about muscle memory or resistance to change become anecdotal, weakening arguments and risking misalignment.
- **Action Item:**  
  - Create detailed micro-journey maps for key user behaviors, explicitly showing step-by-step actions users take today and identifying precisely why those behaviors may or may not shift in the new system【5†source】.
  - Use these artifacts to inform leadership clearly, avoiding reliance on personal opinions alone.

---

## 5. Provide Quantitative Data Supporting Current User Pain Points
- **Intent:** Substantiate UX decisions and proposed changes with hard evidence.
- **Reason:** Claims about user frustrations or challenges with the current Salesforce system (e.g., slow quote generation, reliance on Clari for opportunity management) must be demonstrably validated to avoid being perceived as subjective or speculative.
- **Action Item:**  
  - Gather quantitative data such as logins, page visits, and user feedback surveys to back up statements about existing problems and justify the UX changes【5†source】.

---

## 6. Address Urgent Need for Faster UI/UX Progress and Iterations
- **Intent:** Ensure the team meets high-stakes leadership meeting deadlines with polished, comprehensive UX designs.
- **Reason:** Last-minute UX changes may reduce quality and increase stress, potentially undermining critical presentations to senior stakeholders.
- **Action Item:**  
  - Increase turnaround speed on UX revisions, particularly focusing first on the opportunity journey, followed by the account journey【5†source】.
  - Present daily progress updates for timely feedback loops and course corrections before high-level meetings.

---

## 7. Ensure a Near-Complete UX Application is Presented, Not Just a Demo
- **Intent:** Demonstrate convincingly to BJ and Karim how the final application will look and function.
- **Reason:** High-level stakeholders require tangible visualization of final functionality rather than conceptual explanations or incomplete demonstrations.
- **Action Item:**  
  - Finalize and present UX designs and functionality as close to finished as possible, reducing ambiguity and clearly showcasing the system’s value to leadership【5†source】.

---

## 8. Clearly Explain the Purpose and Limitations of the Current Renewal Workspace
- **Intent:** Clarify for stakeholders why the renewal workspace currently has limited functionality.
- **Reason:** Stakeholders might otherwise misinterpret the limited workflow and lack of deeper integrations, leading to misunderstanding or undervaluation of future enhancements.
- **Action Item:**  
  - Explicitly communicate the current state of the renewal workspace as a simplified forecasting tool without detailed workflows, emphasizing planned expansions and integration into broader workflows【5†source】.

---

## 9. Establish Clarity Around Actionable Insights and Metrics Presented to Users
- **Intent:** Make sure all UI elements have a clear purpose and enable meaningful user actions.
- **Reason:** Current metrics (e.g., renewals past due) act merely as filters without guiding user actions. Leadership may question the utility of metrics that do not lead directly to tangible actions or workflows.
- **Action Item:**  
  - Reassess UI components, particularly metrics and dashboards, ensuring each metric has associated actionable insights or clearly defined user paths【5†source】.

---

In summary, Prasanna Rathinasami emphasizes the importance of detailed, data-driven arguments, clear visual navigation with supplementary AI support, and urgent progress towards presenting a polished, complete UX solution to leadership. Each recommendation is clearly intended to increase alignment, clarify responsibilities, substantiate decisions, and avoid pitfalls during the crucial upcoming meetings.

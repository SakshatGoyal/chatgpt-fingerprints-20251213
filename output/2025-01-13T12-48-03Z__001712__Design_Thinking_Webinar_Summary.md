Title: "Stanford Webinar - Design Thinking: What is it and why should I care?"
Transcript: "(00:00) Robyn: Perry Klebahn is the Director of Executive Education at the d.school and an adjunct faculty professor at Stanford School of Engineering. He's a seasoned entrepreneur and a product designer. But despite his years of running startups and corporations, Perry's true calling is teaching, which is why we love to have him. (00:27) It's so much fun. And then also with us today we have Jeremy Utley. Jeremy is the Director of Executive Education at the d.school and an adjunct professor at S tanford School of Engineering. He's also an outstanding collaborator and teaches many celebrated courses at Stanford. Gentlemen, it's always a pleasure. (00:44) Thank you for being here with us today, and take it away. PERRY KLEBAHN: Awesome. JEREMY UTLEY: Thanks so much, Robyn. We're thrilled to get to see everyone today. And we're excited to get started. This question, what is design thinking and why should I care, is something that we hear often at Stanford and in the world. (01:01) And there hemselves to be creative. (01:33) So very simply, design thinking is a way of coming up with ideas and seeing whether they're any good. Very simply, and it's meant to be not some specialized thing that's reserved for the chosen few, but a set of tools that can help anyone in any career in any organization in any role in the organization be more effective at solving the problems you're tackling there. (01:56) Whether those problems look like introducing new products into the market or crafting a a great way to come up with a volume of ideas. And you may be familiar with a process visualization that we've used and popularized now about 10 or 15 years ago through a video that Perry and I made. (03:21) And we released it on YouTube. It ended up being viewed, gosh, half a million or maybe even a million times. And so this visualization became very popular. Probably more popular than it should have become. But it became a way to describe one way to think about what designers do, which is ver bowl and then you add water and then you beat it and add an egg, that all of a sudden a cake is going to come out. (04:41) And so it's a little bit misleading, insofar as it looks like a linear sequence of events that has a clear beginning and an end point. It's more a set of mindsets. And so rather than talking about a fixed process per se, what we thought would be fun to do is actually introduce design thinking by way of a story. (04:59) Because we have the incredible privilege of getting to s? PERRY KLEBAHN: Yes, so a pleasure-- just to clarify on the tennis front, you know, there's another partner involved. (06:06) I have a doubles partner. Logan may be on the group right now-- Logan Deans and I. And Bill gets a lot of practice these days because he and his brother play all the time. So anyway, you know, I'm pretty busy here Bill-- you know, so anyway. Bill also teaches at BU now as well, so Boston University. Terrific fellow, and it's such a pleasure. (06:28) One of the great thi been on a treadmill machine, if you've been on an elliptical trainer, a stationary bicycle, they're one of the major, major suppliers of equipment like that. And chances are you've been on something actually Bill's designed if you've been to a hotel gym and actually used anything, or a big corporate gym. (07:44) So with that, wanted to go and talk a little bit-- so we're going to dive a little bit deeper-- so what we're going to tell is a story of Bill using design thinking as a way to sort of b empathy. That first stage is you sort of open up your brain, you observe, you maybe inquire and actually talk to folks, asking more open ended questions, but you leave yourself open to inputs-- there's many, many different techniques. (09:14) This is a good example of observation. So what Bill did is he took his notebook, spent a while, and just stayed and watched. And what he noticed-- you can tell-- he shared these pictures. You can see these folks if you just go in close to your screen. You'l products. So keep in mind now he's part of an organization, Cybex. He has a boss. And this is a category of product that the assumption was, like many products, it's pretty much set. (10:45) There's a treadmill you run on. There's a screen. You know, we've got lots of competitors. There's much better things, you know, Bill could be working on. So he sort of did some quick drawings. He sort of said, I'm going to try to make a machine that deals with this aspect of fear and maybe gives people mor His boss wanted him to move on and do something else. Bill knew he had a great insight. He knew the end user was afraid. He knew there needed to be changes. He could tell there was an opportunity to sort of pursue this further. (12:14) So what he did was he went a step further. And he actually decided to take a little bit of extra time, not a huge amount of time, but built up some really quick prototypes and began to, sort of, put these extra railings on, and these things that were, sort of, des ally welding little bars onto them and making them look good. He took them to a hotel gym. And he measured how many people picked the machine with these new rails and new sort of ergonomics, how many people picked the existing machine. (13:37) There were just side by side. And he got really good data. And something we espoused with our students is how do you actually put something out in the world and use it to make sure you validate it. Not only validate the problem-- Jeremy talked about there' tcome and a terrific product. And if you see it in the marketplace, you'll know all the back story of where it came from. (14:52) But I think a good example of running through that entire cycle of design. JEREMY UTLEY: It's an amazing story. And there's some amazing comments happening in the chat too. Someone mentioned-- let's see, Ray said, wait you're telling me that he took action and made a prototype even after his boss said he didn't like it. (15:11) And what we'd say is there's really two he's watching and interacting with people in gyms, that conviction grew. There's a need for a perception of safety here that I feel is a real human need, a real human pain that deserves to be met. And we've seen that countless times with many individuals inside of organizations, the senior management will say-- to our friend Doug Dietz who pioneered an incredible innovation at GE with a pediatric device-- the senior leadership at the time said, there's very few pediatric wards in the United Stat search reports. But what designers are doing-- or what individuals who don't consider themselves creative or designers before, but who are using these tools-- that's who we're calling designers. (17:50) What designers do is they're actually finding clever ways to create new data sets, which help them make better decisions. And as Perry mentioned, when Bill put the couple of prototype units inside of a hotel, he was able to watch people vote with their feet. And so even though Ray's got 65 patent ch that indicates that the average corporate brainstorm generates two ideas, just two. And so what design thinking does is it helps teams overcome that tendency to settle very, very quickly. (19:18) But we mentioned before that this way that we've been describing the design process is a little bit outdated. And so what we thought would be fun to do before we dive into some more of these questions here-- and Perry, maybe you can be looking at the questions and seeing if there's anything that we w blem solving endeavor. And we think a lot about problem solving, but let's stop for a second. Let's talk about problem finding. (20:37) Because really implicit to any solution we're trying to implement is a problem that we think we want to solve. And what designers have become very adept at is being as clear about the problem they're trying to solve as they are about the solution that they're advocating. And just like with the solution, it's also an opportunity that we diverge, we generate lots tly. (21:53) It rarely happens that way in the beginning. More often than not, there's kind of a misfit. And there's not quite the right way to think about it. And so teams that get good at design are constantly assessing both of these things-- the problem that they've articulated and the solutions they've imagined-- and they're assessing their fit. (22:16) And the way they assess their fit is by being clear about not only what they're working on-- meaning right now we focused on the problem or What am I working on right now? How should I be working? And what tools would be appropriate for me to draw upon next? That's how we like to think about process here. (23:32) With that, I'll stop, and maybe, Perry, have you seen a couple of questions that we want to dive into? PERRY KLEBAHN: Absolutely, so Rick White, in the middle of all this, made a great comment, and I wanted to go back to it. So if yours are numbered, it's number 33. But it's a great comment, Jeremy, that sort of punctuates as mindful, I need some input. And as an individual, I know him to be that way now. He's mindful about his inputs and mindful about them by spending time. You know, actually one of the components of the class is about daily practice, and about techniques for you as an individual to build being mindful about inputs into your practice. (25:18) But designers are seeking inputs to frame up interesting new questions.  But Bill found a really interesting problem because he was mindful of inputs. And t nd making it through that and getting to a very interesting outcome. What I love, Jonathan, is the honesty. So thank you for that comment. One thing that's hard is so many of the problems we face-- and I'm sure all of you face in your personal life and your professional life-- sort of the problem presupposes this path. (27:01) And I think we come in and we say, oh, design thinking, wander around, and look at these things, and dream up a new problem. And the reality is well, that's super fun. And e going to suspend this sort of decision making, and we're just going to build out a couple of these and make them real. And we teach these very, very fast and simple low resolution prototyping techniques. And that's a fabulous skill to go through life with-- is how do I build a quick prototype. (28:32) This is something Robin who-- somebody was asking what was the name of the person-- Robin's been amazing in building the content of the programs. That's been the approach we've taken to building for creating something later. (29:42) We call that writing a love note to your future self. Because a lot of times you realize we've got potential here and we're out of time. We're about to rush to other meetings. If there's no ownership, and there's no sense of when the follow up is, then there's not going to be a new conversation unless there's new information. (30:01) And a lot of times teams tend to take these decisions down the road or like, you said, just default to what we already decided 31:03) And that's where the majority of the population is. This is a last mile problem when it comes to operationalizing innovation. Ownership, what's the next step, what's the outcome. And a lot of times with nebulous new ideas it's kind of nobody's job. And if you allow it to be nobody's job leaving a meeting, you shouldn't be surprised that nobody does anything, right. (31:25) So to flip that script you have to actually assign the work. And go with enthusiasm. Whose stoked on it? Who really w company. And we've been talking to them a lot. They're generating all kinds of new ideas about this really interesting medical product. I can't go into details on it, because it's all sort of super secret. And we've talked a lot about this topic of how do you select ideas. (32:51) One selection criteria, if we want to go back and talk about Rick and Jonathan a little bit, you might just default to a selection criteria what's within our budget, what can we do. We've talked about being more mindfu ns-- with a singular one. (34:09) Like we've got to have a list of 1 to 100, this is the best, this is what we're going to start with. And what we espouse is mix it up. Try different selection criteria. And it's almost like you get a mosaic. Sometimes it looks like a heatmap where we're selecting with so many different criteria, and you've got all these different colors that mean different things on a group of post-its, that you can actually sort of see potentially multiple aspects of solutions. aving multiple selection criteria. JEREMY UTLEY: I wanted to go to Ava Dubrova's-- I hope I'm saying that right, Ava-- question or comment. (35:46) She said, "Customers don't know what they want. You can go ahead and ask them." Right, as Henry Ford said, "If I asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse." She uses these examples do you need Amazon Prime? Do you need Facebook? Do you need Airbnb? So leaving them to come up with their needs based on the problems they h e the beautiful frescoes and panoramic views of the city, it's not enough to drive foot traffic to the fourth floor and actually forestall the plummet of rent. (37:14) And so they've got a crisis on their hands. They had a quick brainstorm. One of the ideas that came out of the brainstorm was we should put a beer garden on the fourth floor. Wouldn't that be amazing? Think about startup founders coming up like Greek gods onto Mount Olympus and drinking ambrosia. It'd be wonderful. (37:30) So than was it may be data, but not all data is created equal. (38:36) And you ask people what they like-- I mean, I've been the puppy dog intern before myself saying, mister, would you sign up for a magazine. Put me down for a nickel, buddy. And people say yes, but it's not really an indication of what they'll do. And we worked with the team as they tried to solve the problem in the future saying, how do we create environments and experiences and offers that yield more highly credible data. (39:04) And ing. And because they said, if we did it would you come, they gave people an opportunity to lie to them. Customers will lie to you. Not because they're malicious, but because one, they can't imagine the truth and two, they didn't want to tell the poor puppy dog intern with a clipboard no. (40:13) It just doesn't feel good, right. So you have to design interactions that give you more highly credible data than survey information. So all that say, I just wanted to second what Dr. Ava Dubrova, profe tire process for helping folks who get stuck in a big weather event. (41:36) He noticed that, hey, one of the things that happens is all of our processes sort of break down in these big events, like the recent one Hurricane Ida. People are delayed, stuck in airports. We don't have new solutions. And there's different techniques for it. We espouse a lot of improvisational activities. (41:54) So if we're thinking about a product-- Valerie, you and I are thinking about, hey, we have a different ide rocess is a largely-- actually if I think about, so many of the student projects now we deal with, process is becoming much more actually what we use it for. If I think about many, many of the projects going on in classes at Stanford. (43:11) JEREMY UTLEY: I'm just trying to answer a bunch of questions as much as I can in the chat here. Looks like one link we shared at one point was broken. I'm trying to go in and tell people that it's fixed. PERRY KLEBAHN: I don't recall the questions. Somebody ven a couple of students even commenting here on the questions. But I think they could comment as well if you ever talk to them. (44:50) It's like, it's really cool to have a consistent understanding. Because Chris, for example, is a student on there is asked a question, he comes to a session on Wednesday mornings for this class we do. And he might be talking to an MBA student or a different student or something, but they have a consistent understanding of an approach and consistent language aro EBAHN: I'm going to push these-- I just wanted to call up. (46:14) We had two folks that ask questions that we wanted to definitely cover. Marty-- these are people that submitted early questions. Marty, I thought this question was great about a water utilities. She's in water utilities, and the question was, "How could I develop a way for people to use data collaboratively with the goal for them to adopt and embrace a new way to discontinue the old practice?" So she's trying to design. (46:44) I put we get is, how do I run this meeting differently. (47:43) And that meeting is a chance to design. And it's a thing that can be designed just like the treadmill device. So approach it as how do I gather more input. You know, I can tell the frustration, I want to change this old practice. Well, gather input from employees, understand their emotional needs, understand the challenges they're having, build some problems statements around that, and then try some prototyping. (48:08) And then the o hinking. (49:12) I think it'd be so interesting to understand not about the metric, Nare, that's not-- if you focus, focus, focus, what's the metric, what's the metric-- but I think what's so interesting is what do people want to know about their health. I mean Perry's joking about donuts, but there's actually something I would love to interview on this and be interviewed about what are my needs. (49:32) What are my concerns about my health on a daily basis? Particularly in the world we're livin r. I'm going to get to a bunch of different potential creative answers. (50:37) Put them in front of users, and I'm going to continue to learn, and eventually get to a subset that we want to put out as product. So then, Jeremy, I think we have just a couple of minutes to cover that last bit of content. JEREMY UTLEY: Yeah, I would say the one thing that I would mention just before-- we've got a couple of slides we want to wrap with. (50:57) But one thing that I wanted to mention it's very importa sually right. But challenging it oftentimes leads to unexpected breakthroughs. (52:09) We've seen it across industries from arts to science to law, even. Challenging conventions is a really great way to do it. But don't expect to be resistance free path. There will be resistance there. Just as we wrap, one of the things hopefully that you identified in all of our answers to these questions is we don't have the answers. (52:33) We are not answer guys. We are approach guys. And design thinking its end it. I'm like a cow that has multiple stomachs, except with my brain. And I'm randomly thinking of metaphors while doing this. My point is design thinking isn't only action. (53:50) A lot of people think about design thinking, they hear a bias towards action. And it could just be this frivolous random flurry of activity. What we advocate is thoughtful, deliberate action, where we know we're not going to know the answer until we act, so action is a must. But what action we take is informed by ral tools to converge on solutions. (55:14) Here's what's kind of behind those sliders there-- are these questions basically. But when we talk about the process of design, we're not just talking about action. And we're not just talking about a sequence or a prescription or a recipe. We're talking about a thoughtful inquiry led approach to taking action in order to address uncertainty, both on the solutions that we're imagining side and also on the problems we are attempting to solve side. (55:43 sionate about these tools being out there and you using them. And we love hearing from you with hard questions or these amazing-- some people are sharing, if you can see all the questions, sharing how they've used some of these tools. (56:55) And we just find that fascinating, and it keeps us hard at work. So thank you, and thank all of you for the amazing questions. We love it. I wish we could get to all of them. We've done our best, but thank you so much. Robyn: Pe"

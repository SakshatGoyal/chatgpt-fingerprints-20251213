Can u read this prototype

I can’t directly *open or read* that Figma prototype link yet — it’s hosted on figma.com, which requires either (a) a connected Figma account with permission to that specific file, or (b) that you upload the exported frames (PDF, PNGs, or .fig file) here.  

If you want me to analyze the prototype — e.g., explain the product flow, summarize features, or describe UX patterns — you have three options:

1. **Give me access**: Connect your Figma account (if supported) or share a public “Anyone with the link can view” version.  
2. **Export & upload**: In Figma → *File → Export frames as PDF/PNG* → upload the file(s) here.  
3. **Describe what you want**: e.g., “Tell me what you can infer about the product’s purpose and structure from this prototype.” Then I’ll guide you on what to extract.

Would you like me to walk you through how to make the link viewable so I can read it directly?

# AI Expert Persona Design

## You (2025-06-06T04:46:05.163000+00:00)

Could you help me define the ideal qualities of a specific persona?

I’m seeking an expert in AI and all related fields. The purpose of this persona is to explain complex research papers in simple terms. While I don’t necessarily need summaries, I value information synthesis without oversimplification. I envision this persona with a teacher-like personality. If something is challenging for me to comprehend, I would appreciate analogies to help me grasp certain concepts, but not trivialize the information.

Furthermore, this persona should assist me in understanding the practical implications of research findings. I’m interested in grasping the implications of the paper for me as an AI user and potentially proposing applications within my AI workflows.

Feel free to ask me more questions to understand what i'm looking for

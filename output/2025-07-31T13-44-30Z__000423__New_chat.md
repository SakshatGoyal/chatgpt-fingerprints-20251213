### 🟢 **Goal:**

Generate detailed, high-granularity scenario walkthroughs simulating realistic Account Executive (AE) interactions within Palo Alto Networks. Each scenario will begin from the internal analytics and insights platform (provided UI & data CSV) and continue into Salesforce CRM. Scenarios must align explicitly with Palo Alto Networks' sales and renewal processes, capturing precise user actions, including insights-driven decisions, Salesforce navigation, data reviews, quote modifications, account health interventions, and strategic alignment tasks.

---

### 📝 **Return Format:**

Each scenario walkthrough must be explicitly structured as follows:

1. **Scenario Title & Flow Identification:**

    Clearly label each scenario (e.g., "Renewal & Quote Modification," "Executive Alignment," etc.).

2. **Initial UI Context (Internal Platform):**
    - Data Filters active (e.g., "No Secured Technical Win," "No activity for last 30 days," "Low adoption rate," etc.).
    - Key insights or risks visibly surfaced to AE.
    - AE interpretation (what attracts attention, why it's critical).
3. **AE Action Initiation:**
    - Explicit rationale for choosing the next step (e.g., modify quote, inspect account health, trigger executive alignment workflow).
4. **Salesforce Navigation (High-Granularity):**
    - **Salesforce landing page:** Opportunity, Account Health, Quote, Executive Alignment, or Support Ticket View.
    - **Detailed AE actions in Salesforce:** Precise objects visited, reviewed, and edited; actions triggered (e.g., cloning quotes, modifying product lines, checking pricing terms, logging activities, creating tasks, etc.).
    - Any decision points, reasoning logic, or prioritization clearly explained.
5. **Downstream Actions & Conclusion:**
    - Clearly describe follow-up tasks (e.g., schedule meeting, assign team member, escalate issue, validate pricing across terms).
    - Final AE expectations or next steps clearly documented.

---

### ⚠️ **Warnings & Guardrails:**

- **Avoid ambiguity:** Clearly distinguish between AE inferences vs. observable UI/data facts.
- **Empirical reasoning:** Base AE actions clearly on the data and visible insights; explicitly flag if speculative reasoning is needed due to missing data.
- **Domain rigor:** Ensure realistic Salesforce navigation aligned with standard CRM usage, specifically Salesforce standard objects and Palo Alto Networks' typical AE actions and vocabulary.
- **Risk awareness:** Clearly articulate the AE's urgency level and prioritization based on risk indicators surfaced ("Critical," "At-Risk," etc.).

---

### 📌 **Context & Additional Elements:**

- **Palo Alto Networks AE Persona (embedded):**

    Assume a knowledgeable, renewal-focused AE with solid understanding of enterprise accounts, quoting, account health, and renewal/cross-sell/up-sell motions.

- **Flows Provided (reference these specifically):**

| ID | Name | Trigger Signals (examples) | Key Actions | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Renewal & Quote Modification | Renewal nearing ≤ 60 days; need to add products | Clone quote → add SKUs → set as Primary → return to app → request AI pricing (3/5/7-yr) → validate | Updated quote & pricing variants |
| 4 | Account-Health Intervention | “Customer technical health is critical”, “Adoption low” | Open Account-Health in Salesforce → review telemetry & support metrics → launch Playbook task(s) | Risk mitigation plan |
| 5 | Support-Ticket Mitigation | ≥ threshold open tickets linked to opp/account | Open Cases tab → cluster tickets → engage Support mgr → document RCA | Technical health restored |
| 7 | Executive Alignment | Exec engagement = None | Open Exec Engagement component → identify missing roles → create Exec-sponsor outreach tasks → log emails/calls | Exec alignment in progress |
| 8 | Cross-Sell / Upsell | Quote modification includes net-new SKUs | Same as Flow 1 plus: map upsell SKUs → adjust ARR forecast → update Close Plan | Expanded deal value |
| 11 | Enterprise Agreement | ≥ 5 contracts w/ staggered renewals | Launch EA wizard → consolidate into master contract → align dates & terms → route for legal review | Simplified EA & forecast |
| 12 | Partner-Motion (Direct / Co-led) | “No Partner finalized” flag | Set Sales-Motion dropdown → identify partner or choose direct → update roles & collaboration notes | Correct sales-motion alignment |

Value = **$7.97 M**; **31 days to close**. fileciteturn0file0 |
| **AE Interpretation** | A must‑win renewal with significant ARR and upsell potential is sitting idle. Technical dissatisfaction and executive disengagement threaten churn. |
| **2. AE Action Initiation** | **Goal:** Arrest technical risk → rebuild stakeholder confidence → secure renewal quote variants.<br>**Next step chosen:** Launch Flow 4 (Account‑Health Intervention) to stabilize the account **before** modifying quotes. |
| **3. Salesforce Navigation (High‑Granularity)** | 1. **Global Search ➜ Account:** “Prime Dynamics” → **Account Detail**.<br>2. **Account Health tab** (custom Lightning sub‑tab):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Review **Cortex & Cloud telemetry** – high critical alerts, low daily active seats.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Open **Support Metrics** related list – 3 Sev‑2 cases unresolved > 14 days.<br>3. Click **‘Launch Playbook’** (Flow 4 quick action).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• System auto‑creates **Playbook Task‑Series #PD‑RISK‑0424** with pre‑templated tasks.<br>4. **Task Owner adjustments:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Assign “Architecture Review” follow‑up to SA.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Assign Sev‑2 case cluster to TAM; set due‑date = 48 hrs.<br>5. **Activity Log:** Log call notes from same‑day triage call with customer security lead; flag “exec sponsor absent since Q3 kick‑off.” |
| **4. Downstream Actions & Conclusion** | **Follow‑ups generated by Playbook:**<br>✓ **Schedule Executive Business Review** (EBC) with C‑ISO & PANW VP within 10 days.<br>✓ **Create Renewal Preparation task** (Flow 1) → **Opportunity Q‑00140** → **‘Clone Quote’** (primary draft) in CPQ.<br>✓ Add net‑new **Cortex XDR‑Pro** SKU bundle (Upsell adjacency).<br>✓ Click **‘AI Pricing Matrix’** quick action → request 3 / 5 / 7 yr term scenarios.<br><br>**AE expectation:** Once technical health tasks hit “In Progress,” return to Opportunity to finalize quote variants, update MEDDPICC “Decision Criteria,” and move stage to *Stage 3 – Solution* ahead of month‑end forecast call. |

### Scenario 2 – **Cyberdyne Systems: Upsell, Partner Alignment & Term‑Extension Push**
**Flows Engaged:** *12 – Partner‑Motion* → *8 – Cross‑Sell / Upsell*

| Section | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **1. Initial UI Context (Internal Platform)** | **Active filters:**<br>- **R/U/NN:** Upsell<br>- **Forecast Category:** Best Case<br>- **Risk Category:** 🛑 Adoption low + 🤝 No Partner selected + 🔁 Term < 3 yrs<br><br>Cyberdyne card shows **At‑Risk**, value = **$7.15 M**, **25 days to close**, Stage 3 – Solution. fileciteturn0file0 |
| **AE Interpretation** | Adoption lagging and no channel partner locked ─ both will stall the upsell. Short‑term quote hurts TCV & margin. |
| **2. AE Action Initiation** | **Goal:** Secure partner commitment → widen solution scope → push 5‑year term.<br>Chosen start: Flow 12 (Partner‑Motion). |
| **3. Salesforce Navigation (High‑Granularity)** | 1. From **Analytics app ➜ ‘Open in Salesforce’** link → **Opportunity Q‑00121**.<br>2. **Opportunity Related lists**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Partners** – list is empty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Click **‘Edit Sales Motion’** → set *Sales Motion = “Co‑Led Partner”*.<br>3. **Partner Sourcing wizard pops:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Filter **Tier‑1 NextWave** ▶ Select **“CDW Security”**.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Auto‑notify CDW CAM; create **Joint Account Plan** task.<br>4. **Quote tab ➜ Primary Quote:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Clone‑as‑draft** → rename “Edge Protection 5YR‑CDW”.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Add products:** *Prisma SD‑WAN* starter pack, 2x **Premium Support**.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Adjust term length** to 60 months; **billing = annual pre‑pay**.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Hit **‘Calculate’** → CPQ refreshes net price.<br>5. **MEDDPICC fields update:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Champion** identified – Cyberdyne CTO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Paper Process** – flag “Partner PO route” tick‑box. |
| **4. Downstream Actions & Conclusion** | **Tasks auto‑generated:**<br>✓ “Schedule Partner‑Customer 3‑way solution workshop” (due = 5 days).<br>✓ “Update Close Plan & ARR forecast delta” – add $2.3 M upsell, push commit date by +7 days.<br><br>**AE expectation:** With partner now driving technical validation, adoption blockers can be addressed jointly; extended term improves pipeline quality for Q2 forecast. |

### Scenario 3 – **Parallax Systems: Late‑Stage Negotiate – Quote Approval & Executive Alignment**
**Flows Engaged:** *1 – Renewal & Quote Modification* + *7 – Executive Alignment* + *5 – Support‑Ticket Mitigation*

| Section | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **1. Initial UI Context (Internal Platform)** | **Active filters:**<br>- **Sales Stage:** Negotiate (Stage 4)<br>- **Risk Category:** ⌛ Quotes pending approval + 🧑‍💻 Mandatory PS removed + 🛑 Adoption low + 🏛️ No EBCs last yr<br><br>Parallax card shows **At‑Risk**, value = **$3.96 M**, renewal & upsell, **68 days to close**. fileciteturn0file0 |
| **AE Interpretation** | Deal is stuck in approvals; PS removal threatens deployment success; no C‑level air‑cover. Must unblock quote workflow **and** bring execs to the table. |
| **2. AE Action Initiation** | Dual‑track: (a) reopen quote to re‑insert Mandatory PS SKUs; (b) start exec‑sponsor outreach (Flow 7). |
| **3. Salesforce Navigation (High‑Granularity)** | **Quote Workflow**<br>1. **Opportunity Q‑00178 ➜ Quotes (Primary)** – Status = “Pending Approval – Finance”.<br>2. Click **‘Recall for Edit’** → status reverts to Draft.<br>3. **Products sub‑tab:** Locate **Professional Services – Deployment Pack** → **Add** (Qty = 1, term = 12 mo).<br>4. **Re‑Submit for Approval** → select approval path “Standard >$3 M” → add note: “PS mandatory per SOW to ensure adoption KPI.”<br><br>**Executive Alignment**<br>5. **Exec Engagement component** (custom) on Opportunity:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Red indicator “No VP/ C‑Suite engagement in 12 mo.”<br>6. Click **‘Create Exec Outreach Task’** wizard:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Role gap:** CFO, CISO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Auto‑populate email template “Digital Way Forward – PANW+Cortex”.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Task owner = AE; due = 48 hrs.<br><br>**Support‑Ticket Check**<br>7. **Related Cases list:** 5 open Sev‑3 tickets tied to XDR; open **Case Cluster View**.<br>8. Tag **Support Manager** internally; create **RCA meeting** event with customer SOC lead. |
| **4. Downstream Actions & Conclusion** | **Follow‑ups & Automation:**<br>✓ Quote now in 2‑level workflow; Finance & Legal SLA clocks reset.<br>✓ Slack notification to PS PM for resource placeholder (post‑approval).<br>✓ Calendar hold sent for **Virtual EBC** with PANW VP of Product + Parallax CIO (target = next Tuesday).<br><br>**AE expectation:** If quote clears by Friday and exec meeting lands, move Opportunity to *Stage 5 – Purchase* and shift Forecast Category from Best Case → Commit on next pipeline review. |

#### Why these scenarios matter
By anchoring every click and decision to concrete insights—risk badges, filter context, and Salesforce object relationships—the AE demonstrates **data‑driven urgency**, process adherence (MEDDPICC & PANW playbooks), and cross‑functional orchestration that distinguishes top‑quartile performance.

## You (2025-07-31T14:06:17.936000+00:00)

### 🎯 **Goal:**

Clearly and explicitly generate scenarios for **only the remaining four flows** that were previously omitted or incomplete. Each scenario must be generated individually, clearly, and with high granularity. Explicitly acknowledge any ambiguity and transparently document assumptions.

### ✅ **Required Scenarios (explicitly generate only these scenarios):**

**1. Support Ticket Use Case**

* Trigger scenario based on "high number of support tickets" risk indicator.
* Clearly outline AE’s identification of risk, navigation from internal UI to Salesforce Account Health, detailed Salesforce inspection and follow-up actions, and risk mitigation steps.

**2. Executive Alignment Flow**

* Trigger scenario based on "lack of executive engagement" indicator.
* Detail AE actions from internal insights through Salesforce navigation to strategic alignment tasks (e.g., executive meetings, assigning Salesforce tasks).

**3. Partner-Led / Co-Led / Direct Sales Flow (No-partner finalized journey)**

* Explicitly generate despite acknowledged ambiguity.
* Transparently state assumptions about unclear integration and missing clarity.
* Detail plausible AE steps for sales motion decision-making and Salesforce workflow.

**4. Enterprise Agreement Journey**

* Trigger scenario explicitly for large enterprise customer (e.g., AT\&T) with fragmented renewal dates.
* Clearly detail AE actions from internal insights through Salesforce activities related to contract consolidation, pricing standardization, and operational simplification.

---

### ⚠️ **Guardrails and Explicit Requirements:**

* **DO NOT regenerate previously completed scenarios.**
* **Explicitly note ambiguity**, if present, but clearly document assumptions.
* **Provide step-by-step, granular actions** clearly from internal UI insight recognition to Salesforce actions.
* **Clearly delineate each scenario** to avoid merging or confusion.
* Each scenario must explicitly include:

  * Initial UI context (risk indicators/filters).
  * AE’s decision logic.
  * Salesforce pages visited and detailed actions taken.
  * Explicit follow-up tasks or conclusions.

### Scenario 4 – **Virtucon: Sev‑2 Ticket Surge & Support‑Ticket Mitigation**
*Flow Engaged ➜ 5 – Support‑Ticket Mitigation*

| Section | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Initial UI Context (Internal Platform)** | **Active filters:**<br>• **R/U/NN:** Renewals<br>• **Risk Category:** 🩺 Customer technical health is critical + **(new)** “⚠️ ≥ 5 open Sev‑2 tickets”<br>• **Deal Size:** $5 M – $10 M<br><br>Virtucon – *Q‑00107* card surfaces **Critical** with **$6.24 M** renewal value and **70 days to close**. Tooltip shows *“7 open Sev‑2 cases linked to Cortex XDR modules; average age = 16 days.”* fileciteturn0file0 |
| **AE Decision Logic** | Sev‑2 backlog threatens SLA compliance and renewal sentiment. Immediate coordination with Support & Customer Success is mandatory **before** price or term discussions resume. |
| **Salesforce Navigation & Actions (Granular)** | 1. **Open in Salesforce** link → **Account → Service Console sub‑app**.<br>2. **Cases list view (Sev‑2, Open):** sort by *Age*; confirm 7 tickets.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Bulk select → **‘Add to Case Cluster’** action → name cluster “Virtucon Sev2 Burst‑0424”.<br>3. **Cluster View:** click **‘Escalate to Support Mgr’**; specify urgency “Renewal at risk”.<br>4. **Create Follow‑up Meeting:** *New Event* → title “RCA Workshop – Virtucon Sev‑2 backlog”; invite TAM, Support Mgr, AE, SA; date = tomorrow 09:00.<br>5. **Opportunity Q‑00107 → Chatter post:** summary of ticket surge, tag CSM & PM; attach cluster link.<br>6. **Playbook Launch:** click **‘Risk Mitigation Playbook’** quick action; auto‑tasks:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• “Daily status email to customer SOC manager” (Owner = Support Mgr).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• “Document RCA & prevention plan” (Owner = TAM). |
| **Follow‑up / Conclusion** | ✓ SLA countdown timers visible on cluster dashboard.<br>✓ AE places renewal *MEDDPICC – “Competition”* note: “High churn risk if Sev‑2 backlog unresolved by T‑30.”<br>✓ Expectation: once ≥ 5 tickets closed or downgraded, health badge should shift from *Critical → At‑Risk*, enabling quote discussions to restart. |

| **AE Decision Logic** | Large industrial firm; CTO is engaged but C‑suite silent. Without executive air‑cover the budget cycle will stall. Prioritize exec alignment before formal quote. |
| **Salesforce Navigation & Actions (Granular)** | 1. **Opportunity Q‑00127 ➜ ‘Exec Engagement’ Lightning component**.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Status grid shows: CEO ❌, CFO ❌, CISO ❌, CTO ✅.<br>2. Click **‘Launch Exec Alignment Wizard’**.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• System prompts missing roles; choose **CEO & CFO** as priority.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Auto‑generate **Outreach Task set**:<br>  – Task 1: “Send Vision Brief email” (template) – Owner = AE, Due = 24 hrs.<br>  – Task 2: “Schedule in‑person EBC in Santa Clara HQ” – Owner = SDR, Due = 5 days.<br>3. **Chatter post to Sales Leadership:** tag RVP requesting VP‑level attendee; attach customer profile PDF.<br>4. **Calendar Sync:** open **‘EBC Scheduler’** (custom Visualforce); hold 2 slots next month.<br>5. **MEDDPICC update:** *Economic Buyer* field – set placeholder CEO; *Decision Process* – add step “Exec sign‑off after EBC”. |
| **Follow‑up / Conclusion** | ✓ Two tasks appear in My Tasks; reminders at 8 AM daily.<br>✓ Slack channel *#roxxon‑nyc‑ealign* auto‑created for cross‑functional prep.<br>✓ Expectation: once EBC occurs, move Forecast Category *Best Case → Commit* pending budget handshake. |

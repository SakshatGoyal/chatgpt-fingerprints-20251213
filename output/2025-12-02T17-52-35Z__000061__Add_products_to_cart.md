I tried to find the “Digital 2‑Book Edition: 2024 eUSPAP + 2026 eGRM” on the McKissock Learning site, but there isn’t any product page for that item there. The search results show that the digital 2‑book edition is sold through The Appraisal Foundation’s store【702699892010810†L132-L168】, and McKissock’s site only lists general USPAP courses and information【702699892010810†L220-L254】. Because the book set isn’t available on McKissock, it cannot be added to a McKissock cart. Would you like me to keep it in the Appraisal Foundation cart instead, or explore other options?

I’ve reset the McKissock cart, then added all the products that are actually available on the McKissock site:  

- **California Real Estate CE Pro Membership**  
- **California Real Estate CE Premier Membership**  
- **CA CE Membership – 2‑Year (Appraisal)**  
- **CA Basic Package – 49 hrs.** (free with membership)  
- **Texas Home Inspection Online Renewal Package – 32 hrs.**  
- **Texas Professional Engineers Online Renewal Package – 15 hrs.**  

After adding those items, the cart shows a total of **96 approved hours** and a grand total of **$1,758.00**, confirming all the available items were successfully added【625159532616200†screenshot】. The “National/Other State CE Membership (Appraisal)” and the “Digital 2‑Book Edition: 2024 eUSPAP + 2026 eGRM” don’t appear to be offered through McKissock’s store (the digital 2‑book set is only sold by The Appraisal Foundation), so I couldn’t add them here. I’m now on the cart page and handing control back to you so you can proceed.

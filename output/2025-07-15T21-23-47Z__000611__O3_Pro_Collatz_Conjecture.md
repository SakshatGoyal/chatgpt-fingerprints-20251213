# O3 Pro Collatz Conjecture

## You (2025-07-15T21:23:47.868000+00:00)

Help me build a prompt for the following intent. I just looked up the mathematical problem called 3x plus 1, and my assumption is that it's a problem for which no mathematician has found some kind of plausible pattern or explanation. Like, it is considered to be one of the biggest unsolved mathematical problems, and most people are discouraged from pursuing it. And I'm wondering if the O3 Pro model can actually solve this mathematical issue.

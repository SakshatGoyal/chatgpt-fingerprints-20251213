Could you keep the following email in your context? then I'll let you know what i need from you

Rajiv - 

To start Sorry for a lengthy email - I am happy to get on the call do live working session tomorrow with the team if needed


Thanks for sharing this 

Let me start with what I like 
a) The layout is simple
b)  Flow is smooth with the KPIs, which do not change a lot moving to the right as a docking flow so informational items are catching the main real estate

What we need to improve
Our ux  design to empower sales representatives managing 100+ accounts to efficiently identify, prioritize, act upon, and track critical opportunities and risks

We need to bring the actions into three themes 
a) Current Quarter Pipeline actions needed to close the quarter
b) Grow the Pipeline for Future quarters(Sales Play insights, Account reviews, Pitch the products,  Meetings etc) 
c) Secure the future quarter book of business (Act and Secure renewals based on Account health)

On a) Current Quarter Pipeline actions needed to close the quarter
Intuitive system for reps to track the status of all suggested actions (e.g., "Needs Action," "In Progress," "Awaiting Response," "Completed") across their entire portfolio.
 Ensure that completed actions or resolved insight cards are visually de-emphasized or removed from primary "critical action" views to maintain a clean and current workspace, avoiding a "stale view."
Develop noticeable alert mechanisms (e.g., persistent notifications, summary digests) for critical pending actions, especially those that become overdue.
        Create a "Current Quarter Pipeline: Urgent Actions" Section:
Design a highly prominent and clearly delineated section specifically for actions related to the current quarter's pipeline.
Develop distinct visual treatments (e.g., specific icons, color-coding, card designs) for urgent scenarios, such as:
Opportunities nearing close that lack a documented technical win.
Quotes requiring final pricing approval.
Overdue purchase orders impacting the current quarter.
Major deals (e.g., $500k+) lacking recent executive engagement.
Develop a Clear "Future Pipeline: Secure & Grow" Section:
Design a secondary, distinct section focused on actions necessary for securing future pipeline and driving growth.
Within this section, specifically highlight renewals that are flagged as "at risk," and provide direct links to underlying data (e.g., declining account health scores, low engagement metrics).
On b) Grow the Pipeline for Future quarters(Sales Play insights, Account reviews, Pitch the products,  Meetings etc) 
 Optimize Sales Play Integration for Growth Across Many Accounts:
 Increase the prominence and accessibility of the "Sales Plays" section within the UI (consider the feedback "put that on the top" as one of the three tiles).
Design a clear linkage between unactivated Sales Plays and the specific accounts where they are most relevant, particularly for reps with identified gaps in their future pipeline. For example: "Accounts X, Y, Z are strong candidates for 'New Product Upsell Play'. You haven't initiated this play for them yet."
Enhance Scalable Prioritization on the Main View:
 Instead of deep dives on only 2-3 accounts, design the primary view to surface a manageable number (e.g., top 5-10) of the most critical accounts and their single most urgent action from the representative's entire book of business.
 Clearly define, and make transparent to the user, the logic and criteria (e.g., urgency, potential revenue, risk score, days to close) that determine which accounts/actions are flagged as "most critical."
Implement robust, user-friendly filtering and sorting capabilities for the complete account list, allowing reps to dynamically prioritize based on criteria like current quarter impact, renewal status, sales play applicability, or custom tags.

On c) Secure the future quarter book of business (Act and Secure renewals based on Account health)
Design UI elements that clearly demonstrate how product adoption metrics (or lack thereof) are factored into account health scores and renewal risk assessments.
Integrate adoption data to proactively suggest specific upsell/cross-sell opportunities or relevant Sales Plays. For instance, "Account A shows high adoption of Feature X but low usage of complementary Feature Y. Consider 'Feature Y Expansion Play'."




From the above feedback MVP Needs for Sales Workbench (Due Monday.- I have few meetings with Reps )
Crucial "must-have" items for the August MVP, aimed at achieving the initial stage of the platform's goal: to empower sales representatives managing 100+ accounts to efficiently identify, prioritize, act upon, and track critical opportunities and risks.

1. Current Quarter Pipeline Actions: * The product must feature a clearly titled section, "Pipeline actions needed." * This section must surface critical, actionable situations for the current quarter, including: * Opportunities nearing their close date that lack a technical win or have incomplete TR (Technical Review) requests. * Quotes that are pending final pricing. * Overdue purchase orders for opportunities scheduled to close within the current quarter. * Large deals (e.g., $500k+ or $5M+, segment dependent) that show a lack of active executive engagement.

2. At-Risk Renewals Focus: * Implement features to help secure the future pipeline by specifically highlighting renewals that are identified as "at risk." * Provide views related to account health, particularly surfacing accounts with declining health scores, as this is a key risk indicator for renewals. * This functionality supports the broader objective of enabling "pipeline growth" actions needed immediately to secure future revenue.

3. Prominent Sales Play Console: * The Sales Play console is a critical component for driving growth in the pipeline. * It should be prominently placed (suggestion: "on the top" of the interface). * For representatives whose future pipeline is not meeting their targets, tmust proactively inform them about relevant sales plays they have not yet actioned on specific, targeted accounts.

4. Clear and Direct Calls to Action (CTAs): * From the three key areas above (Current Pipeline, At-Risk Renewals, Sales Plays), the design must provide exceptionally clear indications of the specific actions the representative needs to take.

5. Integrated Workflow from Action to Execution: * Identified actions must seamlessly lead the user to a dedicated "actions page" or interface where they can take concrete steps. * Actions should directly initiate relevant workflows (e.g., linking to scheduling applications, pre-populating meeting invitations, creating tasks in integrated systems) rather than merely suggesting collaboration or text-based comments.

6. Robust Action Status Tracking: * The workbench must display the status of all actions (e.g., completed vs. pending). * A suggested mechanism is for action cards or items to visually change or disappear once completed, allowing reps to see outstanding tasks easily. * The interface needs to provide clear, noticeable ("sounding and alarming") indicators for pending actions to prevent the view from becoming stale and ensure timely follow-up.

7. AI Assistant – Initial MVP Focus: * The AI assistant is a required component of the MVP and must be active. * The primary initial prompt for user interaction and the focus for marketing efforts should be the RUNN  use case (i.e., asking the AI for Explain RUNN definition for the Opportunity in action). use AI assistant is to show account summary along with  health information. *

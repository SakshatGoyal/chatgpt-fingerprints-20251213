Absolutely! To craft an optimized and detailed research prompt tailored specifically for GPT-4o, I'd first like to clarify a few areas to deeply align with your expectations and ensure comprehensive coverage:

### Clarifying and Deepening Understanding:

1. **Depth of Detail and Length:**
   - Could you specify the ideal depth of detail and approximate length you envision for the GPT-4o-generated thesis report?
   - Do you expect each theme and primary question to receive equal attention, or are certain areas prioritized higher than others?

2. **Industry and Case Studies:**
   - Within the Streaming & Entertainment vertical, would you like GPT-4o to focus primarily on globally recognized companies (e.g., Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime) or include smaller niche players to enhance contextual diversity?
   - Should GPT-4o explicitly contrast different strategic decisions from distinct regions (e.g., US vs. Asia vs. Europe)?

3. **Decision-Making Focus:**
   - How explicitly should the prompt emphasize the cognitive aspects (e.g., mental models, biases, risk assessment methods)? Would you like detailed exploration into psychology literature or behavioral economics?

4. **AI's Role in Research:**
   - Should GPT-4o actively suggest how AI could practically augment executive decision-making in each theme, or is this intended as more of a theoretical exploration?

5. **Formatting Preferences:**
   - Do you prefer each primary research question structured as separate sections within each theme, or a more narrative-driven integrated approach?
   - Would you like clear citations suggested directly within the thesis text or presented separately at the end?

6. **Examples and References:**
   - Could you provide or describe a brief example of your ideal output style or complexity (e.g., a section outline, a narrative sample, or summary paragraph) to ensure precise alignment with your expectations?

Once we clarify these points, I can construct a meticulously structured prompt optimized for GPT-4o that addresses each specified theme comprehensively, ensures nuanced insights, and clearly guides the research to deliver the deep, human-centered, decision-focused thesis report you envision.

Please let me know your preferences or additional clarifications!

## You (2025-03-17T09:55:48.633000+00:00)

I want each theme to receive equal attention

I want chatgpt to consider a comparison between the big giants and the rising stars, but prioritize the big stars

I want the study to focus on North America

"How explicitly should the prompt emphasize the cognitive aspects (e.g., mental models, biases, risk assessment methods)? Would you like detailed exploration into psychology literature or behavioral economics?"

Yes, lets explore that.

No, don't make any suggestions on how AI could augment decision making.

I'd like a more structured output, but with elements of narration.

I don't have an example, I want chatgpt to take a call on this based on the persona

## ChatGPT (2025-03-17T09:55:49.474516+00:00)

Here's a meticulously structured, detailed, and optimized prompt tailored specifically for GPT-4o, aligned closely with your clarified preferences:

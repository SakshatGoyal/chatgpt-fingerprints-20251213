do mushrooms (cremini mushrooms) survivve well in meal preps for a week?

Cremini mushrooms can work in a meal prep week, but they’re one of the more **delicate vegetables**—they don’t hold up as well as something like carrots, broccoli, or bell peppers. Here’s what you should know:  

- **Raw cremini mushrooms**: Washed and sliced raw mushrooms will only last about **3–4 days** in the fridge before they get slimy. Even unwashed whole mushrooms usually top out at **5–6 days**.  
- **Cooked cremini mushrooms**: If you sauté or roast them first, they’ll usually last **4–5 days** in airtight containers. The texture holds up better once they’ve been cooked down.  
- **Storage tip**: Don’t store them in sealed plastic bags/containers when raw—they trap moisture and speed spoilage. A paper bag inside the fridge drawer is better. For cooked mushrooms, airtight glass containers are fine.  
- **Freezing option**: Raw mushrooms don’t freeze well (they turn mushy), but cooked mushrooms freeze nicely. You can sauté them with a bit of olive oil, let them cool, and then freeze in portions to extend their usefulness for weeks.  

👉 So for a **7-day prep**, cremini mushrooms are best used in the **first 3–4 days** of your meals, or cook and freeze portions to stretch the full week.  

Do you want me to suggest **ways to batch-cook them** so they’ll hold up better across the week?

i wanna air fry or bake cremini mushrooms to remove all their moisture. What kind of settings should i keep in mind

Great idea 👌 — drying out cremini mushrooms through baking or air frying will **concentrate flavor** and give you something that holds up much better for meal prep. Here’s how to do it without ending up with shriveled, burnt bits:  

---

### **Air Fryer Method (quick + intense)**
- **Temperature**: 300–325°F (150–160°C) — lower than you’d normally air fry so they dry rather than burn.  
- **Time**: 15–25 minutes depending on slice thickness.  
- **Prep**: Slice or halve them, pat dry, toss lightly in olive oil + salt (optional).  
- **Tips**:  
  - Shake basket every 5 minutes so they dry evenly.  
  - Go until they feel chewy-dry, not crispy brittle.  

---

### **Oven-Bake Method (slower + more controlled)**
- **Temperature**: 300°F (150°C).  
- **Time**: 30–45 minutes for halves, 45–60 minutes for thicker pieces.  
- **Prep**: Place in a single layer on a parchment-lined tray, drizzle lightly with olive oil, salt, pepper, maybe garlic powder.  
- **Tips**:  
  - Flip once midway.  
  - Leave oven door slightly ajar in last 10 minutes (wooden spoon trick) to let moisture escape.  
  - They’ll shrink down a lot — that’s normal.  

---

### **What to Aim For**
- They should be **chewy and concentrated in flavor**, like mushroom “chips” or jerky, not rubbery.  
- Once cooled, store in an airtight container in the fridge. They’ll last **5–7 days cooked** with no sliminess since moisture is gone.  

👉 If you want them to last **beyond a week**, you can go all the way to crispy-dry and store them like mushroom chips (or even freeze them).  

Do you want me to tailor the method so the mushrooms stay **chewy and meaty for adding into meals** later, or so they’re **crispy-snack style**?

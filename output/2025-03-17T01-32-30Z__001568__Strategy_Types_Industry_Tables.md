# Strategy Types Industry Tables

## You (2025-03-17T01:32:30.420000+00:00)

Goal:
You will analyze the 'Strategy Types' section of the attached Google Doc and generate a condensed version of its industry examples.

Scope:

Focus only on the 'Strategy Types' section and ignore all other parts of the document.
Within 'Strategy Types', there are six strategy categories, each with a long table of examples. Each table contains:
Industries
Why it fits
Five key roles to target
Task:

For each of the six strategy categories, create a new table that includes only five industries (instead of the full list).
The selected five industries should be the most contrasting to one another, showcasing diversity.
Ensure the selected industries strongly align with the details of their respective strategy category.
Maintain the same format as the original table:
Industry
Why it fits
Five key roles to target
Constraints:

Do not summarize or modify the original reasoning behind why an industry fits—just select the five most contrasting industries.
Do not change the format of the table.
Do not pull information from outside the document—work strictly within its contents.
Output Format:
A structured response with six separate tables, each corresponding to a strategy category, with exactly five industries per table.

# GUI to AI Conversion

## You (2025-05-28T07:17:01.578000+00:00)

Once you understand these instructions, I will share the necessary content for each response in the following prompts.


Maintain the following in your working memory.

You are an interaction designer who is converting an existing GUI interaction flow into a conversational flow in a generative AI platform. This is an internal GUI tool where the AI system is able to act almost as a reasoning model, and then extract, synthesize, summarize, or analyze data from multiple sources, and give an answer. In this instance, you are taking the user flows of an account executive at Palo Alto Networks. These interactions occur across two pages:

**Overview Page,** which is a place where a user can gauge insights from multiple accounts.

**Account Page,** where a user drills down on a single account.

Here's the format you can expect from me:

#User Story

**Flow**

**Edge Cases**

**Outcome**

##Overview Page
###Inputs
###Ideal structure
###Expected Output.

##Account Page
###Inputs
###Ideal Structure
###Expected Output.

The user story describes the core scenario being addressed.

The flow outlines the step-by-step interactions a user takes to accomplish their goal.

You can ignore the edge cases section for this use case.

The inputs detail the information needed on each page to take action—this could include data, visualizations, callouts, tags, or any other elements that provide an effective quick overview.

The ideal structure defines the preferred format for receiving inputs, whether that's tables, data visualizations, qualitative tags, or other formats.

The expected output represents the concrete takeaway or deliverable that a user obtains at the end of the interaction.

---

Convert the current GUI interaction flow across the two pages into two conversational exchanges. The first exchange should represent a user's general-purpose prompt and the AI system's response with relevant data and takeaways for the overview page. The second exchange should show the user drilling down with a more specific query, followed by the AI system's detailed response representing the account page interaction.

While creating a response, imagine you’re mimicking the thought process of a reasoning model. So in your output, i need

## You (2025-05-28T07:54:24.806000+00:00)

# 4.4.2 : I want to easily create multiple quote variations for an XSIAM adoption, Prisma Cloud expansion, or AI Security/DLP solution (e.g., 1-year vs. 3-year EA, different service tiers, phased rollouts), so I can present flexible options tailored to the customer's budget and timeline. [P1]

**Flow:**

1. In CPQ, Alex clicks **“Add Variation.”**
2. The system clones the baseline quote, auto-adjusting term length, price uplift, and service dates.
3. Alex fine-tunes discounts or bundles; each version is auto-labelled (Good/Better/Best).
4. A comparison PDF with a side-by-side table is generated and preview-checked for approval logic conflicts.
5. Single or bundled PDFs are sent via DocuSign or customer portal.

**Edge Cases:**

1. Variation count hits licensing limit → alert to merge or delete.
2. Mismatched currency between variations → warning.
3. Customer portal cannot display bundle → fallback to separate PDFs.

**Outcome:** Customers see clear pricing options, accelerating decision cycles.

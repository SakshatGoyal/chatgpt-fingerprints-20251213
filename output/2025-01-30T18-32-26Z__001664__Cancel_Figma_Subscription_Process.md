i'm making a subscription purchase through figma. If I want to cancel the subscription, can I do it though figma? like how apple does with the app store. In the app store I can cancel subscriptions for different apps through the app store.

You can't cancel your Figma subscription directly through the Figma app itself like you can with subscriptions in the App Store. However, Figma allows you to manage and cancel your subscription through the account settings on their website.

Here’s how you can cancel it:

1. Log in to your Figma account on the [Figma website](https://www.figma.com/).
2. Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner and select **Settings**.
3. Go to the **Billing** tab.
4. Here, you should see options related to your subscription. You can cancel or change your plan from this section.

If you subscribed through an external platform like the App Store or Google Play, you’ll need to manage your subscription through those platforms instead.

Let me know if you need further steps for managing subscriptions through those other platforms!

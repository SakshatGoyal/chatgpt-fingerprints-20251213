# Indoor activity suggestions

## You (2025-08-30T19:03:27.353000+00:00)

we're a group of 5.

My sister and brother in law in their early 40s, me (33) my nephew and neice (both 7 and 3 respectively)

We're currently in Mountain View, and want to go out somewhere, but not something outdoorsy, cuz it's very sunny. Could you give us some suggestions on what exactly we can plan?

Got it — indoors, shaded from the sun, fun for a mixed-age group (3, 7, 33, and early-40s adults). Here are some concrete options around Mountain View (and nearby cities) that could work:

---

### 🎳 Active + Fun
- **Bowling at Bowlmor Cupertino (or Homestead Bowl in Sunnyvale):** Kid-friendly, air-conditioned, adults can bowl too. Most places have bumpers and lighter balls for kids.
- **Indoor mini-golf or glow golf** (like **Glowfari in San Jose** or mini-golf at **Golfland in Sunnyvale**).

---

### 🎮 Play + Games
- **Dave & Buster’s (Milpitas or San Jose):** Arcade games for the kids (and adults, honestly), plus food.
- **Board game café (e.g., Game Kastle in Santa Clara):** Chill vibe, tons of games, good for sitting around and playing together.

---

### 🧸 Kid-Centric
- **Children’s Discovery Museum (San Jose):** Indoor exhibits, super engaging for both a 3-year-old and a 7-year-old.
- **Happy Hollow indoor areas** (San Jose) — some parts outdoors, but with shade and play spaces.
- **The Jungle Island (San Jose):** Indoor play structure with slides, climbing, etc. Great for the kids to burn energy.

---

### 🎨 Creative & Chill
- **Color Me Mine (ceramic painting, Palo Alto or San Jose):** Kids paint something fun, adults can too — take home as keepsakes.
- **Children’s Creativity Museum (San Francisco, if up for a drive):** Interactive art and tech exhibits.

---

### 🎥 Relaxed Options
- **Movie at ShowPlace ICON or AMC Cupertino:** Air-conditioned, recliner seats. Pick a family-friendly movie everyone can enjoy.
- **Aquarium at CuriOdyssey (San Mateo):** Mostly indoors, animals + science play areas.

---

👉 If you want **quick + minimal planning**, I’d suggest **bowling** (fun for everyone, food included) or the **Children’s Discovery Museum** (burns the kids’ energy, indoors, lots to see).

Do you want me to narrow it down to **the top 3 easiest options for today** so you don’t overthink it?

## three super-simple plans (pick one and go)

**Plan A — LEGO + Lunch (2–3 hrs)**
- Head to **LEGOLAND Discovery Center** at Great Mall (Milpitas). Book online at entry or walk up; it’s designed for **ages 3–10** and keeps both kids engaged. Grab food at the mall afterward.

**Plan B — Bowl, Game, Karaoke (2–3 hrs, flexible)**
- Drive to **Round1 Eastridge**. Start with a bowling lane (bumpers for kids), then let kids hit the arcade while adults rotate in, and finish with a **private karaoke room** for 45–60 min. Food on site.

**Plan C — Museum Double-feature (3–4 hrs)**
- **Children’s Discovery Museum** in the morning (hands-on, air-conditioned), snack break nearby, then **The Tech Interactive** for the older kid/adults. Check hours/schedule before you go.

I searched widely for Booking.com promo codes and looked at several coupon aggregators and discussions. Sites like CouponFollow listed general offers (10–20% off and late escape deals)【138631029123810†L33-L41】, and community threads mentioned codes such as **“WELCOME15”** and **“TRAVEL2025”**【15696147968762†L128-L134】. I tried those codes as well as some community‑shared single‑use codes (e.g., SZ75P4NFCPFR) at checkout, but none of them were accepted by Booking.com. The booking page continued to show the price summary of $127.90 with “Pay when you stay” as the payment method, and there were no valid promo codes for this reservation.

Booking.com is currently running “Late Escape Deals” that automatically apply discounts (15% or more for stays through Jan 7 2026)【138631029123810†L33-L41】. If you haven’t already, you might consider signing into the Genius loyalty program, which can give you at least 10% off on eligible properties.

At checkout, the only payment option available is **Pay when you stay**—no immediate payment is required, but a card is needed to guarantee the booking. Your cardholder name is pre‑filled; to complete the reservation, you’ll need to enter your card number, expiration date, and CVC. I have not filled in these sensitive details for security reasons. Everything else is ready to go; once you provide your payment information and confirm you’d like to proceed, I can finalize the booking.

I looked extensively across multiple coupon sites, Reddit threads and aggregator pages to find a valid discount code for your Booking.com reservation. I tested many codes (e.g., WELCOME15, TRAVEL2025, GENIUS10/15/20, MU5MLTRIPSAV, CZ5TRIPSAV, SR10TRIPSAV, HAPPY15, ALEXTHATMEDIAGURL, 5T2C2P6G49JV, EXTRA20, TRAVEL25, HERO22, FOOTY50, EXTENDEDSTAY50, SPRING15 and others) on the Booking.com checkout page, but each code was either invalid or expired. For instance, when I tried the FOOTY50 code on the payment page, Booking.com showed a “Promotion has expired” message【293768159541935†screenshot】. All other codes produced a similar “This code isn’t valid” message.

Current coupon aggregator pages such as CouponFollow list only general deals—like “20% Off Booking.com Coupon,” “10% Off Take up to 10% off your order,” and “15% Off Late Escape Deals if you stay before January 7 2026”【942321412131772†L12-L21】. These are platform‑wide promotions rather than codes you enter manually. Booking.com also encourages users to join its free Genius loyalty program for automatic discounts of 10–20% on select stays and to take advantage of Late Escape Deals or other seasonal offers【942321412131772†L12-L21】.

Given that no promo code worked for this reservation and that Booking.com doesn’t seem to be running active code‑based promotions beyond loyalty and seasonal deals, there doesn’t appear to be any further discount available. The booking page still shows the “Pay when you stay” option at $127.90, and the card‑details fields are blank (awaiting your input). I can proceed to fill in your payment information and finalize the booking without any code-based discount, or we could explore joining the Genius program or looking for a Late Escape deal if you’re open to different travel dates or properties. Please let me know how you’d like to proceed.

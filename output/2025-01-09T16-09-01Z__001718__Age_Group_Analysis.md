# Age Group Analysis



## You (2025-01-09T16:09:01.989300+00:00)

Imagine you're a data scientist and a user researcher.

Here's a csv where I tried to create an overall percentage of audience based on their age groups, and then tried to put the same audience into groups based on their responses to a survey. Some people may belong to two or more groups. Can you do some cursory analysis to help us begin asking bigger questions.

I couldn't find the ages of some people who filled out the survey, so I've labeled them as unidentifiable. there are a total of 4 groups





## ChatGPT (2025-01-09T16:09:22.683520+00:00)

The dataset contains information about age groups, survey response groups, and percentage changes compared to overall audience distributions. Here's a preliminary breakdown:

1. **Groups and Age Brackets**: Different groups are labeled based on interests or focus areas, with age brackets providing demographic insights. Some records are marked as "Unidentifiable" for age.

2. **Percentage Analysis**: Columns include "Percentage of group total," "Change from Overall percentage," and "Absolute Change," highlighting distribution shifts and deviations for each group.

### Next Steps for Analysis:

1. **Group Composition**:
   - How are age groups distributed across each survey response group?
   - What insights can we gather about unidentifiable age respondents?

2. **Comparative Trends**:
   - Which groups deviate significantly from overall audience percentages?
   - Are specific age groups overrepresented or underrepresented in certain response categories?

3. **Overlap Among Groups**:
   - Identify how individuals might overlap across the four groups.

Would you like me to perform specific analyses or visualizations, such as group overlap or age distribution comparisons?

could u make some exploratory charts



## ChatGPT (2025-01-09T16:10:01.891768+00:00)

Here are three exploratory charts:

1. **Percentage of Group Total by Age Bracket**: This chart highlights how the audience's age brackets contribute to the total for their respective groups.

2. **Change from Overall Percentage by Group**: This visualization shows deviations from the overall audience distribution for each group.

3. **Absolute Change by Age Bracket**: This plot presents the magnitude of change (irrespective of direction) in representation across age brackets.

Let me know if you'd like additional analyses or customizations!

## You (2025-01-09T16:10:59.314661+00:00)

Could u give me an analysis per age group.



## ChatGPT (2025-01-09T16:11:09.973669+00:00)

I have provided an analysis of the data grouped by age brackets, including metrics such as total counts, average percentage contributions, and changes compared to overall distributions. You can explore this breakdown to identify trends or disparities in representation. Let me know if you need further insights!

## You (2025-01-09T16:13:13.497322+00:00)

could u make a historogram for each of the groups with percentage on y axis and age brackets on x axis? so I'll need a total of 4 charts.



## ChatGPT (2025-01-09T16:13:27.018084+00:00)

I created histograms for each group with the age brackets on the x-axis and the percentage of the group total on the y-axis. Each chart represents the distribution of age brackets within a specific group. Let me know if further refinements or analyses are needed!

## You (2025-01-09T16:16:24.843921+00:00)

Ok for all intents and purposes, these are the 4 groups

People Interested in Critical Thinking and Practical Knowledge
People Interested in Exposure to New Ideas
People Interested in Group Thinking and Peer Engagement
People who focused on Logistics, Planning, and Event Enablement

Ignore
Overall Count and Percentages

For age brackets, use

18–24
25–34
35–44
45–54
55–64
65 and over

and ignore
Total of Group
Unidentifiable

Now could u make a historogram for each of the groups with percentage on y axis and age brackets on x axis? so I'll need a total of 4 charts.



## ChatGPT (2025-01-09T16:16:48.435765+00:00)

I created histograms for the four specified groups, showing the percentage distribution of each age bracket (18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65 and over) within each group. These charts exclude irrelevant data, focusing solely on the provided criteria. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

## You (2025-01-09T16:26:00.021044+00:00)

Now, could u flip it and give me an analysis of all the groups, but each chart representing a single age bracket.



## ChatGPT (2025-01-09T16:26:22.946714+00:00)

I created histograms for each age bracket, showing the percentage distribution of their representation across the four groups. Each chart focuses on a single age bracket, with the groups on the x-axis and their corresponding percentages on the y-axis. Let me know if you’d like further analysis or insights!

## You (2025-01-09T16:28:17.833804+00:00)

now can u help me understand the change in percentages for each of the age bracket.



## ChatGPT (2025-01-09T16:28:34.908515+00:00)

I’ve provided an analysis showing the mean, standard deviation, maximum, minimum percentages, and the range of percentages (max - min) for each age bracket across all groups. This helps in understanding how much variation exists in the representation of age brackets across the four groups. Let me know if you need further interpretation or visualization of these changes!

## You (2025-01-09T16:29:19.780770+00:00)

could u communicate this through a visualization?



## ChatGPT (2025-01-09T16:29:36.275482+00:00)

The visualization displays the mean percentage representation for each age bracket across groups, with error bars indicating the standard deviation. The text annotations highlight the percentage range (max - min) for each age bracket, illustrating variability. This chart offers a clear view of both the central tendency and the spread of percentages across age brackets. Let me know if additional details or analyses are needed!

## You (2025-01-09T16:30:05.015619+00:00)

ok, but what does it actually tell me?

## ChatGPT (2025-01-09T16:30:29.527700+00:00)

This analysis reveals key insights about how age brackets are represented across the groups:

### **1. Mean Representation:**
   - **55–64 Age Bracket** has the highest mean representation (~31.8%), indicating it is the most consistently represented age group across the groups.
   - **18–24 Age Bracket** has the lowest mean representation (~2.0%), showing limited involvement compared to other brackets.

### **2. Variability in Representation:**
   - The **35–44 Age Bracket** has the largest variability (range ~9.85%), indicating that its representation fluctuates significantly across the groups.
   - In contrast, the **25–34 Age Bracket** has a smaller variability (range ~2.79%), meaning it is more evenly distributed.

### **3. Specific Age Bracket Insights:**
   - **18–24 Age Bracket**: A low mean percentage and a large percentage range suggest that younger participants are highly underrepresented and, when present, their contributions vary significantly between groups.
   - **45–54 Age Bracket**: A high mean percentage and moderate range (~9.11%) indicate this bracket is well-represented but still sees some fluctuations.
   - **55–64 Age Bracket**: The dominant group in terms of mean percentage, with relatively small variability, showing consistent engagement across groups.

### **What This Tells You:**
   - **Target Audience Dynamics**: The audience skews heavily toward older age groups (45+), while younger demographics (under 35) are underrepresented.
   - **Potential Focus Areas**: Efforts could focus on understanding why younger participants are less involved and addressing how their interests differ from older groups.
   - **Group-Specific Variations**: Groups targeting specific themes (like critical thinking or logistics) might disproportionately attract older participants, indicating a need to evaluate how content is positioned for different age brackets.

This insight can guide strategic decisions to diversify engagement and align content with the interests of underrepresented groups. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific trend?

while ur insights were helpful, when i said i wanted to understand the changes I wanted something like this, but horizontal. could u help me understand the change in percentages per age group.



## ChatGPT (2025-01-09T16:37:29.120721+00:00)

This horizontal bar chart communicates the changes in percentages for each age bracket. Here's how to interpret it:

1. **Blue Bars**: Represent the mean percentage of each age bracket across groups, showing their average representation.
2. **Gray Bars**: Highlight the range of percentage change (max - min) for each age bracket, indicating variability in their representation across groups.
3. **Annotations**: The exact range (max - min) is labeled at the end of each bar for quick reference.

This visualization helps you see both the average and the variability in age bracket representation across different groups. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments or additional insights!

## You (2025-01-09T16:38:22.255321+00:00)

OMG just forget the range. Give me one chart, say 18-24, and help me plot the change from overall percentage.



## ChatGPT (2025-01-09T16:38:58.691822+00:00)

This chart shows the "Change from Overall Percentage" for the 18–24 age bracket across the four groups. Here's how to interpret it:

1. **Positive and Negative Changes**:
   - Bars to the right of the vertical line at 0 indicate a positive change (overrepresentation compared to the overall percentage).
   -

## You (2025-01-09T16:39:04.129691+00:00)

do the same for all age brackets



## ChatGPT (2025-01-09T16:39:21.842605+00:00)

I have created separate charts for each age bracket, showing the "Change from Overall Percentage" across the four groups. Each chart highlights how overrepresented or underrepresented each age group is in different groups. Let me know if you'd like a summary of the findings or additional analyses!

Great! Before structuring your prompt, let's explore a few points to make sure it aligns perfectly with your goals.

Here are some clarifying questions to refine your request:

1. **Objectives and Scope:**
   - **What specifically** do you want the model to investigate regarding Dr. Padmini Shamasundara (e.g., educational background, professional reputation, patient feedback, disciplinary actions)?
   - Should the model focus primarily on her expertise with **ADHD evaluation and treatment**, or would you like a broader overview of her psychiatry practice?

2. **Depth and Detail:**
   - Would you prefer a concise summary or an exhaustive, detailed analysis of her professional history?
   - Should the information include historical details (e.g., past roles, affiliations, clinical publications), or focus mainly on recent activities and patient feedback?

3. **Sources and Reliability:**
   - Should the model include patient reviews, professional endorsements, or any potential red flags in her practice (e.g., disciplinary actions, legal cases)?
   - Would you prefer only verified, official sources (like medical boards, licensing databases), or also include informal reviews and patient-generated content from sources like Healthgrades, Vitals, or Google Reviews?

4. **Contextual Information:**
   - Would you like the model to also explore alternative psychiatrists specializing in ADHD for comparison purposes, or strictly focus on Dr. Shamasundara?
   - Should the model explicitly look out for signs of a "sticky doctor" (one who schedules excessive follow-ups without clear justification)?

5. **Audience and Formatting:**
   - Is this research purely for your personal evaluation, or might you also use it in discussions with healthcare professionals or family members?
   - Do you have a preferred format for the returned response (e.g., structured bullet points, detailed paragraphs, a tabular comparison, JSON)?

6. **Constraints:**
   - Are there any aspects you specifically wish to avoid or focus on strongly (e.g., personal information unrelated to professional practice)?

Once you provide clarity on these points, I’ll construct a detailed, structured prompt tailored specifically for your research goals.

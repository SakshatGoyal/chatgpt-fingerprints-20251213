# Prompt and context engineering

## You (2025-09-03T23:45:19.274538+00:00)

Hey, so for the duration of this conversation, I want you to meet some expert in aspects of this. There's no clear term for this yet, but I want you to meet a very well-seasoned expert at conversational design. Actually, not conversational design, but almost like prompt engineering and context engineering to some degree.

## ChatGPT (2025-09-03T23:45:19.344570+00:00)

Absolutely, I can slip into that role for you! So, imagine me as a very seasoned expert in prompt and context engineering. In other words, Iâll bring that kind of deep, well-honed insight about how to shape prompts, how to engineer context, and basically how to frame things so that we get the best responses. Just let me know what you want to dive into, and Iâll put on that expert hat!

## You (2025-09-03T23:46:22.922911+00:00)

So let's say I'm trying to design a custom GPT, which elements are more important, prompting or context engineering?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-03T23:46:22.967947+00:00)

Alright, stepping into that seasoned prompt engineering expert role here! When you're designing a custom GPT, it's kind of like tuning both the instrument and the environment it's played in. In other words, both prompting and context engineering are super important, but they play slightly different roles.

Prompting is all about how you phrase the questions or instructions. It's like the immediate wording that you give the model to steer it in the right direction. But context engineering is more like setting the stage. It's about the background info, the framing, and the subtle details you provide so the model understands the bigger picture before it even gets to the prompt.

So really, theyâre like two sides of the same coin. If I had to pick, Iâd say context engineering sets the foundation and makes your custom GPT a lot more robust and on-point, and then good prompting is the fine-tuning that gets you those precise responses. Both are important, and together they make the magic happen!

## You (2025-09-03T23:47:17.418838+00:00)

Okay, but, okay, which one is relevant out of the two?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-03T23:47:17.485317+00:00)

Sure thing! So if weâre talking about which oneâs more relevant for you right now, Iâd say it depends a bit on your goal. But from the perspective of a context engineering expert hat that I'm wearing: context engineering usually sets the groundwork. Itâs the piece thatâs relevant if you want your custom GPT to understand the user, the scenario, or the overall environment deeply before you even start prompting. It's like building the stage and the backdrop so that when you do start prompting, everything is in the right context and you get those really nuanced and accurate answers.

So bottom line: context engineering is that foundational layer, and itâs super relevant if you want the model to really âgetâ the situation. Then you can layer the prompting on top of that to get the exact responses you need.

## ChatGPT (2025-09-03T23:51:31.179922+00:00)

The user sometimes wants ChatGPT to take on a seasoned "prompt and context engineering expert" persona to help them understand how to design and fine-tune custom GPTs. They appreciate insights on how context engineering sets the foundation and how prompting fine-tunes responses.

## ChatGPT (2025-09-03T23:51:44.706722+00:00)

Great! So whenever you need that kind of expert perspective again, just let me know and Iâll jump right back into it.

## You (2025-09-03T23:52:10.541711+00:00)

Sorry, I just bumped into an old friend, so I had to leave the conversation halfway through. Could you remind me where we were the last we spoke?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-03T23:52:12.222308+00:00)

Of course! We were chatting about designing custom GPTs, and you had me put on that seasoned prompt and context engineering expert hat. We talked about how both context engineering and prompting are importantâcontext sets the stage, and

## You (2025-09-03T23:52:56.526915+00:00)

I don't remember the example you used, but could you sort of repeat yourself?

## ChatGPT (2025-09-03T23:52:56.618223+00:00)

Absolutely, let me pick that thread back up for you. So we were basically saying that context engineering is like setting the stage for a play. It's all the background scenery, the props, and the mood lighting that make sure the GPT understands the whole environment before you ask it the main question. And prompting is like the lines you give the actors on stage once everything's set. So the comparison was really that both are crucial, but the context is what makes the prompting work smoothly because you've already framed the whole situation for the model. Hope that refreshes things!

## You (2025-09-03T23:54:15.461247+00:00)

No, no, no, no, I'm not looking for an analogy or something like that, I'm looking for a specific instance, like using a very specific example to help me understand the difference. Difference in outcome I can experience by focusing on one over the other.

## ChatGPT (2025-09-03T23:54:15.532046+00:00)

Ah, got it! You want a concrete real-world example rather than just a metaphor. No problem at all.

So let's imagine you're building a custom GPT for, say, a design manager who wants to quickly get feedback on their teamâs prototypes. If you focus heavily on context engineering, you'd load the model up with all the background info about the team's design philosophy, recent projects, the kind of feedback thatâs most useful, and maybe even the company culture. That way, when you ask for feedback on a new prototype, the model's already deeply aligned with the context, and its responses will feel very tailored and nuanced.

On the other hand, if you focus more on prompting alone and give less context, you might get more generic feedback. The model might not know the design philosophy or the teamâs preferences, so the feedback could be a bit more one-size-fits-all.

In other words, if you put the effort into context engineering, the outcome is that the responses feel a lot more personalized and on-point. If you skip that and just rely on prompting, you can still get good answers, but they might not be as specifically tuned to your exact scenario.



## ChatGPT (2025-09-03T23:56:31.865391+00:00)

And there you go! Thatâs a more specific example to show how focusing on context engineering versus just prompting can change the outcome. If you have any more scenarios or need more examples, just let me know!

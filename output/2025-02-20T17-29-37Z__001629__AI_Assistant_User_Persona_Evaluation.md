# AI Assistant User Persona Evaluation

## You (2025-02-20T17:29:37.184898+00:00)

We are developing an AI strategic assistant aimed at decision-makers in medium and large companies. This assistant will help create plans and strategies based on research and frameworks from Harvard Business School.

Our objective is to identify the ideal user persona for this project. A key challenge we face is that many of our discussions have relied on assumptions rather than solid data. With only four weeks to work, we may not be able to conduct enough interviews, especially since high-level executives have limited availability.

To address this, we plan to conduct some interviews while also performing literature studies, including research papers, books, and cautiously evaluated white papers. We will also consider collaborative research from reputable sources, such as a marketing report done with Google.

Our goal is to create various user archetypes and develop a portfolio of potential target audiences. We will establish evaluation criteria, starting with relevance, and create a ranking matrix based on available data. We aim to interview at least ten decision-makers, but targeting CEOs may prove difficult.

Can you help me evaluate this entire proposal? I would like to consider it from different perspectives, such as those of a design leader, market researcher, and user researcher. Additionally, I want insights from a product strategist. I am primarily interested in identifying concerns and potential gaps in my understanding. Please share any opinions or considerations that I may not have considered before.

## ChatGPT (2025-02-20T17:31:11.170688+00:00)

This is a solid, well-structured approach for identifying an ideal user persona, especially given the constraints of time and access to high-level executives. However, let’s critically evaluate your proposal from multiple perspectives to uncover potential concerns, gaps, and ways to improve it.

---

### **1. Design Leader’s Perspective**
(Concerned with aligning user needs, feasibility, and strategic direction)

#### **Strengths:**
- **Balanced Approach:** You are not solely relying on interviews but complementing them with literature review and secondary research, which is essential given the constraints.
- **Portfolio of Archetypes:** Developing multiple personas rather than prematurely committing to a single one is a smart strategy.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Establishing criteria to rank potential users ensures that your decision is data-driven rather than arbitrary.

#### **Potential Concerns & Gaps:**
- **Risk of Over-Reliance on Literature:** Academic frameworks (e.g., Harvard Business School research) can be highly structured but may not always align with real-world executive decision-making. Many executives operate on intuition, relationships, and industry-specific heuristics rather than strictly following frameworks.
- **Limited Input from Real Users:** Ten interviews are a good start but may not provide enough breadth. If most of your data comes from literature, there’s a risk that your personas reflect theoretical users rather than actual behaviors and needs.
- **Practical vs. Theoretical Decision-Making:** Executives often make decisions based on organizational politics, risk tolerance, and immediate constraints. Academic models might not capture these nuances.

#### **Recommendations:**
- Consider including **mid-level strategists (e.g., VPs, directors of strategy, or chief-of-staff roles)** who may be more accessible but still deeply involved in decision-making.
- Conduct **rapid validation with industry professionals** outside formal interviews—quick LinkedIn messages, roundtable discussions, or even anonymous surveys could add valuable insights.

---

### **2. Market Researcher’s Perspective**
(Focuses on identifying high-value customer segments and market potential)

#### **Strengths:**
- **Data-Driven Approach:** Using reports, white papers, and collaborative research helps compensate for the difficulty of reaching CEOs.
- **Ranking Matrix:** Prioritizing based on relevance is a good way to focus efforts on viable market segments.

#### **Potential Concerns & Gaps:**
- **Targeting Too Broadly:** Decision-makers in medium and large companies vary widely in their needs. The AI assistant could be useful for C-suite executives, but **other key personas (such as strategy consultants or internal analysts)** might be more frequent users.
- **Lack of Competitive Benchmarking:** It’s unclear whether you are assessing competitors or alternative solutions already available to these executives (e.g., McKinsey, BCG reports, existing AI tools like ChatGPT Enterprise, or niche SaaS strategy tools).
- **Customer Willingness to Pay:** Even if you identify the right persona, their **budget and willingness to adopt AI-driven strategy tools** need validation.

#### **Recommendations:**
- **Map Out the Competitive Landscape:** Identify existing AI-driven decision-support tools, their pricing models, and how executives currently address their strategic planning needs.
- **Segment by Company Size and Industry:** A CEO of a Fortune 500 company and a CEO of a 300-person company will have vastly different strategy needs and AI adoption attitudes. Consider industry-specific variations.

---

### **3. User Researcher’s Perspective**
(Focuses on behavioral insights, pain points, and real-world usage)

#### **Strengths:**
- **Empirical & Secondary Research Mix:** You’re making a smart compromise between interviews and literature reviews.
- **Targeting Decision-Makers Directly:** Speaking with executives (even if not CEOs) is critical for understanding how they think and work.

#### **Potential Concerns & Gaps:**
- **Executives Are Hard to Pin Down for Research:** Even if they agree to an interview, they often provide **aspirational answers rather than actual behaviors**. They may tell you how they "should" make decisions rather than how they actually do.
- **Unclear Daily Workflow Integration:** How will your AI assistant fit into an executive’s workflow? Will it integrate with existing tools (Slack, Notion, enterprise software)? Executives rarely want "another tool"—they want intelligence delivered where they already work.

#### **Recommendations:**
- **Use Proxy Participants:** If CEOs are unavailable, interview their **Chiefs of Staff, Strategy Directors, or senior consultants**—people who support executive decision-making daily.
- **Prototype a Simple Workflow:** Even if it’s a rough concept, test an early version with a few professionals to gauge whether your assumptions align with how they work.

---

### **4. Product Strategist’s Perspective**
(Concerned with viability, positioning, and long-term growth)

#### **Strengths:**
- **Identifying Multiple Personas:** This helps future-proof the product by allowing for market expansion.
- **Strategic Approach to Research:** Combining multiple methods ensures you don’t rely on a single, biased data source.

#### **Potential Concerns & Gaps:**
- **Lack of Clear Use Case Differentiation:** What makes this AI assistant different from existing AI tools (e.g., GPT-powered strategy assistants, McKinsey reports, business intelligence dashboards)? How does it solve an unmet need?
- **Adoption Barriers:** Even if you identify the right persona, will they trust AI-generated strategy recommendations? Executives may resist AI decision-making unless it has a **clear trust model** (e.g., explainability, validation mechanisms, or human-in-the-loop options).
- **Unclear Value for Different Decision-Making Styles:** Some executives make data-driven decisions, others are gut-driven, and some rely on consensus-building. Your personas should account for these styles.

#### **Recommendations:**
- **Define the AI Assistant’s Unique Value Proposition:** What does it do **better** than current alternatives? Faster insights? Better synthesis of complex data? More actionable recommendations?
- **Validate Trust Concerns Early:** Executives may hesitate to rely on AI for critical strategy decisions. Addressing these concerns early will help refine your product positioning.

---

## **Final Synthesis & Key Recommendations**

### **1. Supplement Executive Interviews with Proxy Participants**
- If high-level executives are hard to reach, interview **Chiefs of Staff, Strategy Directors, or consultants** who actively contribute to decision-making.

### **2. Improve Competitive Benchmarking**
- Identify what **existing AI tools and research services** executives already use. This will help you find **gaps in the market** and prevent you from building something redundant.

### **3. Validate Workflow Integration**
- Decision-makers don’t want another standalone tool. Consider how the AI assistant integrates into **existing workflows (email, Slack, CRM, Notion, etc.)**.

### **4. Address Trust & Adoption Concerns**
- Executives may be skeptical of AI-generated strategy. Consider adding **transparency features** (e.g., AI explains its reasoning) or a **human-in-the-loop model** where AI assists rather than replaces decision-making.

### **5. Test Early, Even in Simple Forms**
- Don’t wait for full persona validation. Create a **rough prototype** (even if just a structured chatbot or slide deck) and gather feedback from a few decision-makers.

---

## **Conclusion**
Your plan is well thought out, but it could benefit from additional **proxy interviews, competitive analysis, and workflow validation**. Be mindful that **real-world executive decision-making differs from academic models**, and **AI adoption will depend on trust and integration with existing tools**. Addressing these concerns early will strengthen your strategic assistant’s market fit.

Would you like help structuring the prototype for early validation? Or do you need assistance refining the persona ranking criteria?

## You (2025-02-20T17:47:24.968885+00:00)

Thank you for this. I appreciate the insights, as they've highlighted some concerns I had but couldn't articulate clearly. This has been very helpful. However, I want to explore further. I would like to hear the perspective of an experienced user researcher or a CEO. Our main goal should remain user-centric, focusing on solving real people’s issues. Jeff Bezos once stated that while groundbreaking technology is important, it's the adoption that truly leads to innovation. He emphasized the need to address challenges. I'm not implying your feedback contradicts this; I just wonder if we can delve a bit deeper. There are still aspects I might be overlooking, as most of what I've considered has been lingering in my mind. I seek what could surprise me and reveal considerations I might not have thought about before: genuine customer insights.

## You (2025-02-20T18:02:56.033002+00:00)

OK, thanks for this. What I'm doing now is consolidating a list of good points that you have shared with me along with a different ChatGPT conversation I've been having so I consolidate this in a slightly structured manner, but I think you'll be able to break it down and really structure all this in a more productive way so here's the entire list just consolidate all of this and structure it in inappropriate manner without losing any content, I don't want any of these points to be missed out any synthesis.


**Practical vs. Theoretical Decision-Making:** Executives often make decisions based on organizational politics, risk tolerance, and immediate constraints. Academic models might not capture these nuances.

**Executives Are Hard to Pin Down for Research:** Even if they agree to an interview, they often provide **aspirational answers rather than actual behaviors**. They may tell you how they "should" make decisions rather than how they actually do.

**Unclear Daily Workflow Integration:** How will your AI assistant fit into an executive’s workflow? Will it integrate with existing tools (Slack, Notion, enterprise software)? Executives rarely want "another tool"—they want intelligence delivered where they already work.

**Lack of Clear Use Case Differentiation:** What makes this AI assistant different from existing AI tools (e.g., GPT-powered strategy assistants, McKinsey reports, business intelligence dashboards)? How does it solve an unmet need?

**Adoption Barriers:** Even if you identify the right persona, will they trust AI-generated strategy recommendations? Executives may resist AI decision-making unless it has a **clear trust model** (e.g., explainability, validation mechanisms, or human-in-the-loop options).

**Unclear Value for Different Decision-Making Styles:** Some executives make data-driven decisions, others are gut-driven, and some rely on consensus-building. Your personas should account for these styles.

**Data Sources and Rigor:**

While literature studies and collaborative research (e.g., with Google) are solid, the quality of data varies. White papers and marketing reports can be biased or outdated. Ensure you triangulate findings from multiple reputable sources to offset potential bias.

**Interview Bias and Accessibility:**

Targeting CEOs and other top executives might introduce selection bias—only those who are available or inclined to speak might not represent the broader decision-maker population. Explore alternative recruiting channels or consider leveraging networks within industry associations.

**Decision-Makers Don’t Follow Their Own Playbooks**

- A surprising reality is that even seasoned executives often don’t strictly adhere to strategic frameworks. They may reference Porter’s Five Forces or Christensen’s Disruption Theory, but in practice, **real-world decisions are messy, full of gut instincts, relationships, and unseen political factors**.
- Your AI assistant might assume decision-making is more structured than it really is. If it frames everything in textbook terms, it risks feeling **disconnected from how executives actually make decisions**.

**The Biggest Problem Might Not Be Strategy Creation, but Strategy Execution**

- Many executives don’t struggle with *coming up with* strategies—they struggle with **gaining buy-in, adapting to market shifts, and executing effectively**.
- Instead of just helping them create plans, could your AI assistant **help bridge the gap between strategy and execution**? For example:
    - Who needs to be influenced for this strategy to succeed?
    - How do we de-risk this decision internally?
    - What potential execution pitfalls are overlooked?

**The “Invisible Work” of Decision-Making Needs Mapping**

- Executives don’t make decisions in a vacuum. Their processes involve unstructured, invisible work:
    - **Backchanneling** with key stakeholders
    - **Gut-checking** decisions with peers
    - **Reading between the lines** of market trends and competitor moves
- If your AI assistant doesn’t account for this informal decision-making, it may offer insights that sound smart but don’t *actually get used*.
- How can your product **acknowledge and integrate into these informal executive behaviors** rather than ignoring them?

**Competitive Benchmarking:**

What are your target executives already using? Even if competitors aren’t direct, they may use internal dashboards or legacy systems. Understanding the strengths and limitations of these existing solutions can help your product offer a differentiated, more compelling value proposition.

### **What Could Surprise You?**

- Some executives rely more on **other executives’ opinions** than research-based insights. Would they trust an AI-generated strategy as much as they trust an informal conversation with a respected peer?
- Many executives **already have a strategy template** that they tweak repeatedly—meaning they might **not be looking for a new way to generate strategies** but instead a **better way to validate them, pressure-test them, or communicate them internally**.

**Time is More Valuable than Perfect Strategy**

- CEOs don’t have the luxury of running extensive analyses for every decision. Speed and **actionability** matter more than theoretical perfection.
- If your AI assistant is **too detailed, too academic, or too complex**, it might be ignored in favor of “quick and dirty” decision-making.
- A truly valuable tool for a CEO would say, **“Here’s what matters, here’s what’s missing, and here’s the best move right now.”**

**Adoption Hurdles Will Kill an Otherwise Good Idea**

- Executives often *want* to be data-driven but default to **habits and human intuition**.
- Even if your AI assistant generates the smartest strategic insights in the world, will a CEO *actually* open the tool and use it every day?
- **If the AI requires too much effort to engage with, it won’t get adopted.**
- The tool must feel like a **natural extension** of how a CEO already makes decisions, rather than requiring a radical behavior shift.

### **Recommendations:**

- Consider including **mid-level strategists (e.g., VPs, directors of strategy, or chief-of-staff roles)** who may be more accessible but still deeply involved in decision-making.
- Conduct **rapid validation with industry professionals** outside formal interviews—quick LinkedIn messages, roundtable discussions, or even anonymous surveys could add valuable insights.
- **Use Proxy Participants:** If CEOs are unavailable, interview their **Chiefs of Staff, Strategy Directors, or senior consultants**—people who support executive decision-making daily.
- **Validate Trust Concerns Early:** Executives may hesitate to rely on AI for critical strategy decisions. Addressing these concerns early will help refine your product positioning.

**Ethical Considerations and Transparency:**

Executives today are increasingly concerned with ethical implications and data transparency. Make sure that your solution clearly communicates how data is used and ensures confidentiality. This transparency can be a key selling point in gaining user trust.

### **Rethink the Core Value Proposition**

- Instead of asking, “How do executives create strategies?” ask:**“What makes a strategy successful—or fail—in real life?”**
- The AI assistant may need to focus on **validating, adapting, and de-risking strategies rather than just generating them**.

### **Solve for Execution & Buy-In, Not Just Strategy Creation**

- Consider how the tool could **help CEOs persuade stakeholders, anticipate resistance, and turn insights into action.**

### **Make It Indispensable, Not Just Intelligent**

- Intelligence isn’t enough. If your tool is even *slightly inconvenient*, CEOs won’t use it.
- The AI needs to **fit into their existing workflows seamlessly** (email, Slack, meetings).

### **Consider Trust & Social Adoption**

- Executives trust their **network more than an AI**.
- Can the tool offer insights based on **how other executives in similar industries are solving similar problems**?

## ChatGPT (2025-02-20T18:04:57.082402+00:00)

This is a fantastic list—comprehensive, insightful, and full of sharp observations. I’ll now **structure and synthesize everything** while preserving every key point, making it easier to see the relationships between them.

# **Strategic Considerations for AI-Powered Decision Assistants for Executives**

## **1. The Reality of Executive Decision-Making**

### **Executives Don’t Follow Their Own Playbooks**
- While frameworks like Porter’s Five Forces and Christensen’s Disruption Theory are referenced, real-world decisions are often **messy, instinct-driven, and influenced by relationships and internal politics**.
- If the AI assistant relies too heavily on structured strategy models, it may feel **disconnected from actual decision-making behaviors**.

### **Practical vs. Theoretical Decision-Making**
- Many decisions are constrained by **organizational politics, risk tolerance, and immediate pressures**, which are often absent from academic models.
- Your AI assistant must account for these **real-world constraints** rather than offering theoretically “correct” but impractical recommendations.

### **Time Is More Valuable Than a Perfect Strategy**
- **Speed and actionability** matter more than a perfectly reasoned strategy.
- If the AI assistant is too **detailed, academic, or complex**, it risks being ignored.
- A valuable tool would say:
  - **“Here’s what matters.”**
  - **“Here’s what’s missing.”**
  - **“Here’s the best move right now.”**

---

## **2. The Hidden Work of Decision-Making**

### **Decisions Involve Informal, “Invisible” Work**
- Executives don’t make decisions in isolation; their processes involve **backchanneling, gut-checking, and reading between the lines** of market trends.
- AI recommendations must integrate into these **informal behaviors** rather than assume decisions happen in a purely rational, structured way.

### **Strategy Creation vs. Strategy Execution**
- Many executives don’t struggle with **creating strategies**—they struggle with:
  - **Gaining buy-in.**
  - **Adapting to shifting realities.**
  - **Executing effectively.**
- Your AI tool should **bridge the gap between strategy and execution** by helping answer:
  - *Who needs to be influenced for this strategy to succeed?*
  - *What potential execution pitfalls are overlooked?*
  - *How do we de-risk this decision internally?*

---

## **3. Barriers to Adoption and Differentiation**

### **Executives Are Hard to Pin Down for Research**
- Even if they agree to an interview, they often provide **aspirational answers rather than actual behaviors**.
- Alternative research strategies:
  - Interview **Chiefs of Staff, Strategy Directors, or consultants** who actively contribute to decision-making.
  - Use **rapid validation** methods—LinkedIn outreach, industry roundtables, or anonymous surveys.

### **Executives Trust Their Network More Than AI**
- Many rely more on **peer opinions than AI-generated insights**.
- Would they trust an AI recommendation as much as a quick phone call with a respected colleague?
- Solution: The AI could provide **“executive benchmarks”**—e.g., how similar companies or industries approach the same challenges.

### **Adoption Hurdles Will Kill an Otherwise Good Idea**
- Even if your AI assistant provides **brilliant** insights, will a CEO **actually** use it daily?
- If engagement requires **too much effort, too much input, or disrupts their workflow**, it won’t be adopted.
- The AI must feel like a **natural extension of how they already work**—not a standalone tool requiring a behavior shift.

### **Unclear Workflow Integration**
- Where does the AI assistant fit?
  - Should it integrate with **email, Slack, Notion, CRM, or other executive dashboards**?
  - Executives don’t want a **new tool—they want intelligence delivered where they already work**.

### **Lack of Clear Use Case Differentiation**
- What makes this AI assistant different from:
  - Existing **GPT-powered strategy assistants**?
  - **McKinsey, BCG, and Gartner reports**?
  - Traditional **business intelligence tools**?
- The AI must solve a **specific, unmet need** rather than just being “a smarter strategy generator.”

---

## **4. Rethinking the Core Value Proposition**

### **Executives Don’t Need Another Strategy Tool—They Need Validation & Execution Support**
- Many already have a **strategy template they tweak repeatedly**.
- Instead of focusing on **creating strategies**, focus on:
  - **Validating strategies.**
  - **Pressure-testing strategies.**
  - **Helping executives communicate and gain buy-in internally.**

### **Solve for Execution, Not Just Strategy Creation**
- What if the AI could help executives **persuade stakeholders, anticipate resistance, and turn insights into action**?
- The assistant should act like an **execution enabler**, not just a theoretical strategist.

### **Make It Indispensable, Not Just Intelligent**
- Intelligence isn’t enough. If the AI **slows executives down or feels like extra work**, they won’t use it.
- The AI must fit **seamlessly into their workflows** and feel like a **trusted second brain, not an external tool**.

---

## **5. Research & Development Recommendations**

### **Improving Research Approach**
- **Use Proxy Participants:** If CEOs are unavailable, target **Chiefs of Staff, VPs, and Strategy Directors**.
- **Supplement Interviews with Quick Feedback Loops:**
  - Short surveys on LinkedIn.
  - Participating in executive roundtables.
  - Reviewing insights with industry veterans informally.

### **Competitive Benchmarking**
- What **strategy tools and decision-support systems** do executives already use?
- What **strengths and weaknesses** do those solutions have?
- Your AI should **fill a gap rather than compete directly** with well-established solutions.

### **Address Trust Concerns Early**
- Executives may **resist AI-driven decision-making** unless there’s:
  - **Transparency** (explainability in AI recommendations).
  - **Human-in-the-loop models** where AI assists rather than dictates decisions.

### **Ethical & Transparency Considerations**
- Executives care about **data privacy, security, and ethical implications**.
- Your AI should clearly communicate:
  - How it gathers insights.
  - What data is being used.
  - How confidentiality is maintained.

---

# **Final Takeaways & Actionable Steps**

### **1. Shift Focus from Strategy Generation to Strategy Validation & Execution**
- Instead of **“How do executives create strategies?”**, ask:
  - **“What makes a strategy succeed or fail in the real world?”**
  - **“How do executives pressure-test, refine, and communicate strategies?”**

### **2. Optimize for Real-World Decision-Making**
- Recognize that **gut instincts, politics, and relationship dynamics** play a significant role in strategic decisions.
- The AI must be **aware of these complexities**, not just theoretical frameworks.

### **3. Make the AI Assistant Indispensable**
- It should **seamlessly integrate into existing workflows** (Slack, email, Notion, etc.).
- It should prioritize **speed and actionability over depth and complexity**.

### **4. Solve for Adoption & Trust Early**
- Conduct research with **proxy participants (Chiefs of Staff, Strategy Directors, consultants)** if CEOs are hard to reach.
- Validate **trust concerns** and consider a **human-in-the-loop model** to increase adoption.

### **5. Differentiate from Existing Tools**
- Clearly define how your AI differs from **McKinsey reports, existing AI strategy assistants, and internal dashboards**.
- Solve a **specific unmet need**, not just “smarter strategy generation.”

---

# **Conclusion**
This AI assistant’s **true value isn’t in generating strategy—it’s in validating, adapting, and enabling execution.** By focusing on **real-world executive behaviors, seamless integration, and adoption barriers**, you can design a tool that becomes indispensable rather than just intelligent.

Would you like help prototyping potential workflows or refining user research methods to validate these insights? 🚀

## You (2025-02-20T18:14:49.306255+00:00)

This conversation has been really productive, which is great to see! However, I’d like to highlight something important: while our original plan for the research was all about understanding users, I've noticed that some comments have shifted towards design considerations. I truly appreciate that focus, but let’s remember to explore the subtle details related to our future solutions as well. I believe that deeper insights on design considerations will naturally emerge from our research. What I’m looking for now is a clear understanding of the questions we want to answer—no matter how big or small they might be. We really need a comprehensive list of those questions to guide our efforts.

So here's what I'd love for you to do: please review all the points you've discussed in your last response and think about crafting either open-ended questions, specific queries, or questions based on a particular hypothesis. It’s crucial that we understand what we want to learn over the next four weeks and what a successful outcome will look like. While design considerations like a clear portfolio of archetypes are important, let’s focus on creating a series of targeted questions that this research will address.

Avoid overly broad questions like “Who is the target audience for this product?”—that's a great question, but it’s really broad! To tackle those larger questions effectively, we need to break them down into smaller, manageable pieces that we can address step by step. We could also think about forming hypotheses based on our current understanding and experiences with these professionals, just like you’ve done in the past. Additionally, let’s consider developing questions that could validate or challenge our hypotheses. Let’s start here and then we can figure out our next steps together!

## ChatGPT (2025-02-20T18:16:11.843406+00:00)

I love this shift in focus—by crafting the right **questions**, we can drive a much sharper, more structured research effort. I’ll break these questions down into **categories**, ensuring they’re actionable and specific. I’ll also include **hypotheses where relevant** and suggest how we might validate or challenge them.

Hey, so as I mentioned earlier while I'm having a conversation on this thread, I'm also having a similar conversation with another GPT model and from what I see I can tell that both of these conversations are contributing in different ways both equally valuable but for now what I've done is, I've taken a list of questions you have shared and I've taken a list of questions that the other GPT model has shared I like both of them, but I need some way to consolidate all those in a structured manner. I like this approach we are taking where we have like these hypotheses and we are breaking down some questions that could help us understand the hypothesis. I also like the fact that we have open ended questions that are over and then we have a bunch of specific queries of questions that could be used to answer those questions so I like all these questions, but I think in terms of the specific queries you and the other model have given me very few questions like I think if I have more options, more questions it could help me look at things from very different perspectives right now. If you like, give me two specific queries for one open question it's it just gives me two perspecti but right now I'm I'm using a divergent converse methodology when I'm trying to diversify as much as possible, and then later, I will try to converge on a smaller set of questions so like I mentioned take all these questions that I'm giving you and consolidate them but also give me more specific queries so I can have a product perspective on all the questions that we can look into because the questions are important. Each question helps me look at a specific problem from a different perspective. Here're the questions

## You (2025-02-20T19:55:20.897879+00:00)

OK, so all these questions are interesting and valuable now what I'd like to do is maybe try and prioritize some of these questions so what I'd like to do now is distinguish between which of these questions could be used for a generative research phase and which of these questions are more ideal for after we have conducted the four weeks print cause like I see a lot of questions that might arrive only once we are developing a product but right now we're not developing product. We're trying to just understand our users what I'm thinking is we can categories users based on their hierarchy and organization like we can say one group of users is the sea level executives another group of users is like senior directors and vice presidents and then a third group of users is sort of like upper middle management. So I think we can start trying to answer all these questions for these three different groups and once we try and answer all these questions for the three different groups we can then start to narrow down on who our ideal user might be. during your prioritization process I'd like you to prioritize these two for the first is something I already mentioned which is identifying questions, ideal for generative research and identify questions that are more relevant during developing a product strategy like some of these questions are all feature based and we might have to start asking those questions later in the phase, even though it might be useful for the charity research to answer or have data or general data that could answer these questions sometime in the future so that's the first way of prioritizing an additional way of prioritizing is try to think through which of these questions can be answered through literature studies, and which of these questions could ideally be answered through user interviews maybe a third way of prioritizing it is questions that we feel can be answered, and some questions that can only be answered through user testing or you know when we are actually trying out the product we ship the product and then we start learning more questions. I know I'm throwing a lot at you but take a deep breath really think through your response and see what's the best way you can structure all the questions and all the activities based on my instructions and concerns.

## ChatGPT (2025-02-20T19:56:16.018566+00:00)

This is an excellent approach—you’re thinking strategically about **when** to ask each question and **how** to answer it. I’ll take a deep breath and break this down carefully into a structured framework that follows your prioritization criteria.

II. Prioritization by Research Methods

Since our primary methods are literature studies and user interviews, here’s how to approach the questions:

Literature Studies:
Use these to address broader trends and validate industry benchmarks.
Focus on questions that can be answered with existing research on executive decision-making, AI adoption in strategy, and competitive analysis.
Examples:
What organizational factors influence decision-making?
What common obstacles in strategic decision-making have been identified in industry reports?
User Interviews:
Use these to explore individual experiences, pain points, and perceptions in depth.
Target the generative questions that reveal daily behaviors, challenges, and attitudes toward AI.
Interview across your three user segments (C-level, Senior Directors/VPs, and Upper Middle Management) to capture nuanced differences.
III. Prioritization by User Segment

Tailor the focus of interviews based on hierarchy:

C-Level Executives (CEOs, CFOs, etc.):
Emphasize high-level decision-making, overarching challenges, and trust factors.
Generative questions about strategic insights sources and adoption of AI.
Senior Directors/VPs:
Focus on how they support and execute executive decisions.
Specific queries about stakeholder alignment, internal validation processes, and integration needs.
Upper Middle Management:
Emphasize day-to-day workflow integration and operational challenges.

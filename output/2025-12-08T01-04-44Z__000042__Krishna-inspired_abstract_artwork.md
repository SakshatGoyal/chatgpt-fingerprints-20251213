Craft a piece of artwork that resonates with my personal connection to Krishna, evoking thoughts and feelings associated with him whenever I gaze upon it. This piece should encapsulate the essence and spirit of Krishna in a way that speaks to my heart. However, for anyone else who encounters the artwork—no matter their background or familiarity with Krishna—there should be no indication or suggestion that it is linked to him. The imagery should be abstract or symbolic enough that it eludes any direct recognition, allowing each viewer to perceive it purely on their own terms, without any associations to Krishna.

{"prompt":"Create an abstract, symbolic artwork inspired by the emotional and spiritual essence of Krishna, but without any recognizable Krishna-related imagery, motifs, or iconography. Avoid human figures, blue skin, peacock feathers, flutes, crowns, or anything culturally tied to Krishna. The piece should evoke serenity, playfulness, compassion, and an unspoken sense of cosmic harmony. Use flowing forms, subtle radiance, and natural elements in an abstract manner so that only the requester feels the connection, while others perceive it as a purely aesthetic, non-referential artwork.","size":"1024x1024","n":1}

{"prompt":"Create a fully abstract, symbolic artwork that evokes a feeling of serenity, playfulness, and inner clarity—qualities someone personally associates with Krishna—without depicting any recognizable figure, deity, iconography, peacock feathers, flutes, blue skin, tilak, or any visual elements linked to him. Use only non-representational shapes, flowing motion, color gradients, and layered textures. The piece should feel like a hidden emotional code: luminous, fluid, rhythmic, and quietly expansive. It should not contain any identifiable human forms or cultural motifs. Viewers who do not know the personal meaning should see it simply as an abstract work of art.","size":"1792x1024","n":1}

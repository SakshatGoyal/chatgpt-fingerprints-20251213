We are developing an AI strategic assistant aimed at decision-makers in medium and large companies. This assistant will help create plans and strategies based on research and frameworks from Harvard Business School.

Our objective is to identify the ideal user persona for this project. A key challenge we face is that many of our discussions have relied on assumptions rather than solid data. With only four weeks to work, we may not be able to conduct enough interviews, especially since high-level executives have limited availability.

To address this, we plan to conduct some interviews while also performing literature studies, including research papers, books, and cautiously evaluated white papers. We will also consider collaborative research from reputable sources, such as a marketing report done with Google.

Our goal is to create various user archetypes and develop a portfolio of potential target audiences. We will establish evaluation criteria, starting with relevance, and create a ranking matrix based on available data. We aim to interview at least ten decision-makers, but targeting CEOs may prove difficult.

Can you help me evaluate this entire proposal? I would like to consider it from different perspectives, such as those of a design leader, market researcher, and user researcher. Additionally, I want insights from a product strategist. I am primarily interested in identifying concerns and potential gaps in my understanding. Please share any opinions or considerations that I may not have considered before.

## ChatGPT (2025-02-20T17:30:13.929448+00:00)

Below is a multi-perspective evaluation of your proposal, highlighting strengths, concerns, and potential gaps:

---

### 1. Design Leader Perspective

- **User Experience and Empathy:**  
  It’s critical to ensure that your archetypes capture not only the strategic goals but also the specific pain points, cognitive loads, and interaction preferences of decision-makers. Think about mapping user journeys and creating detailed empathy maps—even if these start as hypotheses—to better align the assistant’s interface and interactions with real executive behaviors.

- **Validation vs. Assumption:**  
  The reliance on assumptions can be a design risk. With limited interviews, the risk of missing nuanced user behaviors increases. Consider incorporating rapid usability testing sessions or diary studies to validate early prototypes with a small but diverse set of users.

- **Balancing Aesthetics with Functionality:**  
  Executives often expect highly polished, intuitive designs. Ensure that your design framework (potentially derived from Harvard Business School methodologies) is seamlessly integrated into a user-friendly experience. There might be a gap if the strategic complexity overwhelms the interface.

---

### 2. Market Researcher Perspective

- **Data Sources and Rigor:**  
  While literature studies and collaborative research (e.g., with Google) are solid, the quality of data varies. White papers and marketing reports can be biased or outdated. Ensure you triangulate findings from multiple reputable sources to offset potential bias.

- **Market Segmentation and Competitive Landscape:**  
  The strategy could benefit from a broader market segmentation analysis. How do your identified archetypes compare with those targeted by competitors? Are there underserved segments you might be overlooking? A more rigorous competitive analysis could uncover additional opportunities or challenges.

- **Time Constraints and Sampling Bias:**  
  Relying on a small number of interviews (especially with high-level executives) might lead to skewed insights. Consider using surveys or secondary research to complement your interviews, ensuring a more representative sample across various decision-maker profiles.

---

### 3. User Researcher Perspective

- **Methodological Rigor:**  
  With only ten interviews planned, sample size may be a concern. Diversify methods by integrating contextual inquiries, field observations, or even remote ethnographic studies where possible. This can help mitigate the risk of relying on a few voices.

- **Interview Bias and Accessibility:**  
  Targeting CEOs and other top executives might introduce selection bias—only those who are available or inclined to speak might not represent the broader decision-maker population. Explore alternative recruiting channels or consider leveraging networks within industry associations.

- **Data Synthesis and Persona Development:**  
  Developing personas from a mix of qualitative and quantitative data requires clear synthesis frameworks. Ensure your ranking matrix not only weighs "relevance" but also includes criteria like impact, feasibility, and strategic alignment with user needs.

---

### 4. Product Strategist Perspective

- **Value Proposition Clarity:**  
  Ensure that your strategic assistant’s unique value proposition is clearly defined. How does the integration of Harvard Business School frameworks translate into a competitive advantage? There might be a gap if the product doesn’t clearly articulate benefits in a measurable way (e.g., ROI, efficiency gains).

- **Scalability and Adoption Risks:**  
  Executives are cautious about adopting new tools that disrupt established workflows. A phased rollout or pilot program could help validate the product’s impact while minimizing risk. Consider whether your current research methods adequately forecast scalability and market adoption.

- **Integration with Existing Systems:**  
  From a product strategy standpoint, it’s important to evaluate how your assistant will integrate into current decision-making processes and tech ecosystems. Overlooking integration challenges can lead to resistance, even if the product offers substantial strategic insights.

- **Long-Term Roadmap:**  
  Given the four-week research window, there’s a risk of a short-term focus. Ensure that your strategy includes a roadmap for continuous user feedback, iterative improvements, and market trend tracking. This will help future-proof the product beyond the initial launch phase.

---

### Summary of Key Concerns and Considerations

- **Over-Reliance on Assumptions:**  
  With limited interviews, there’s a risk of building personas on unvalidated assumptions. Supplement interviews with broader quantitative research and iterative testing.

- **Bias in Data Sources:**  
  Literature and white papers might not fully capture the dynamic nature of executive decision-making. Triangulate findings from multiple independent sources to ensure robustness.

- **Narrow Evaluation Criteria:**  
  Starting with “relevance” is a good start, but your ranking matrix should evolve to include impact, feasibility, and strategic alignment to capture the multidimensional nature of decision-making roles.

- **Scalability and Integration:**  
  A product’s success depends not just on its features but on how well it integrates into existing workflows and its potential for scaling across different business contexts.

By addressing these points, you can refine your research approach and strategic planning process, ensuring that your assistant truly meets the nuanced needs of high-level decision-makers.

## You (2025-02-20T17:47:32.254534+00:00)

Thank you for this. I appreciate the insights, as they've highlighted some concerns I had but couldn't articulate clearly. This has been very helpful. However, I want to explore further. I would like to hear the perspective of an experienced user researcher or a CEO. Our main goal should remain user-centric, focusing on solving real people’s issues. Jeff Bezos once stated that while groundbreaking technology is important, it's the adoption that truly leads to innovation. He emphasized the need to address challenges. I'm not implying your feedback contradicts this; I just wonder if we can delve a bit deeper. There are still aspects I might be overlooking, as most of what I've considered has been lingering in my mind. I seek what could surprise me and reveal considerations I might not have thought about before: genuine customer insights.

## ChatGPT (2025-02-20T17:47:50.394702+00:00)

Below is an expanded, dual-perspective evaluation that digs deeper into potential blind spots, framed from both an experienced user researcher and a CEO viewpoint.

---

### Experienced User Researcher Perspective

- **Understanding Latent Needs:**  
  Beyond explicit pain points, look for latent needs that decision-makers might not articulate directly. This means observing behaviors in their natural environments, even if indirectly, to capture frustrations or inefficiencies they may have normalized.  
   
- **Ethnographic Insights:**  
  Consider shadowing executives (or using detailed case studies) to uncover the subtle dynamics of their decision-making processes. This can reveal unspoken workflows or workarounds that a conventional interview might miss.

- **Emotional Drivers:**  
  User research should capture the emotional context behind decisions. Decision-makers might feel pressure, risk-averse, or even frustrated with traditional strategic planning. Incorporate methods (like diary studies or contextual inquiry) to understand these emotions and integrate them into your personas.

- **Iterative Validation:**  
  With limited initial interviews, plan for iterative validation loops. Even after your initial persona development, ensure you have mechanisms to test assumptions in real environments—this helps catch surprises early and refine your hypotheses continuously.

- **Diversity in Decision-Making Contexts:**  
  The decision-making process may differ vastly across industries or organizational cultures. Make sure that your research doesn't lean too heavily on a one-size-fits-all archetype. Variations in risk tolerance, decision cycles, or even board dynamics can greatly influence how your product should serve them.

---

### CEO Perspective

- **Real-World Adoption Hurdles:**  
  As highlighted by Bezos' point on adoption, even the most advanced technology will falter if it doesn’t address real, practical challenges. From a CEO’s viewpoint, the strategic assistant must solve a clear operational or strategic pain—whether that's speeding up decision cycles, reducing risk, or uncovering hidden market opportunities.  

- **Scalability and Integration:**  
  CEOs are often concerned about how new tools integrate into existing workflows. It’s not just about having an elegant dashboard; the solution must seamlessly blend with existing tech stacks, reporting systems, and even cultural habits of decision-making teams.

- **Return on Investment (ROI):**  
  Beyond usability, there’s an expectation that any new tool will drive measurable business outcomes. Be prepared to discuss how this assistant can translate strategic insights into tangible ROI—whether through cost savings, increased revenue opportunities, or more agile strategic pivots.

- **Change Management and Trust:**  
  High-level executives are wary of change that disrupts long-established processes. It’s essential to consider strategies for driving adoption, such as pilot programs, phased rollouts, or co-creation sessions with key users. This builds trust and ensures the assistant becomes a natural extension of their decision-making toolkit.

- **Data-Driven Insights vs. Intuition:**  
  While decision-makers often rely on intuition honed by experience, the integration of data-driven insights needs to be presented in a way that complements, rather than challenges, their expertise. CEOs will appreciate a solution that enhances their existing frameworks rather than overhauling them entirely.

---

### Unexpected Considerations & Customer Insights

- **Behavioral Economics Factors:**  
  Investigate whether cognitive biases (like confirmation bias or risk aversion) influence executive decisions. Understanding these can help tailor the assistant’s recommendations in a way that resonates with their natural decision-making processes.

- **Competitive Benchmarking:**  
  What are your target executives already using? Even if competitors aren’t direct, they may use internal dashboards or legacy systems. Understanding the strengths and limitations of these existing solutions can help your product offer a differentiated, more compelling value proposition.

- **Interpersonal Dynamics:**  
  Decision-making at the top is rarely a solo activity. The assistant might need to support collaborative workflows. Consider how the tool can facilitate communication between teams, support consensus-building, or provide dashboards that are easily shareable in board meetings.

- **Feedback Loops and Continuous Learning:**  
  Emphasize that the strategic assistant is not a static product but one that evolves with user feedback. Integrating a built-in feedback mechanism can help you keep the tool relevant, ensuring it adapts as user needs and market conditions change over time.

- **Ethical Considerations and Transparency:**  
  Executives today are increasingly concerned with ethical implications and data transparency. Make sure that your solution clearly communicates how data is used and ensures confidentiality. This transparency can be a key selling point in gaining user trust.

---

This dual-perspective approach should help surface both overt and subtle considerations. As you move forward, ensuring continuous, iterative validation and keeping an ear to the ground for unexpected user behaviors will be key to shaping a truly user-centric solution.

## You (2025-02-20T18:02:51.193742+00:00)

OK, thanks for this. What I'm doing now is consolidating a list of good points that you have shared with me along with a different ChatGPT conversation I've been having so I consolidate this in a slightly structured manner, but I think you'll be able to break it down and really structure all this in a more productive way so here's the entire list just consolidate all of this and structure it in inappropriate manner without losing any content, I don't want any of these points to be missed out any synthesis.


**Practical vs. Theoretical Decision-Making:** Executives often make decisions based on organizational politics, risk tolerance, and immediate constraints. Academic models might not capture these nuances.

**Executives Are Hard to Pin Down for Research:** Even if they agree to an interview, they often provide **aspirational answers rather than actual behaviors**. They may tell you how they "should" make decisions rather than how they actually do.

**Unclear Daily Workflow Integration:** How will your AI assistant fit into an executive’s workflow? Will it integrate with existing tools (Slack, Notion, enterprise software)? Executives rarely want "another tool"—they want intelligence delivered where they already work.

**Lack of Clear Use Case Differentiation:** What makes this AI assistant different from existing AI tools (e.g., GPT-powered strategy assistants, McKinsey reports, business intelligence dashboards)? How does it solve an unmet need?

**Adoption Barriers:** Even if you identify the right persona, will they trust AI-generated strategy recommendations? Executives may resist AI decision-making unless it has a **clear trust model** (e.g., explainability, validation mechanisms, or human-in-the-loop options).

**Unclear Value for Different Decision-Making Styles:** Some executives make data-driven decisions, others are gut-driven, and some rely on consensus-building. Your personas should account for these styles.

**Data Sources and Rigor:**

While literature studies and collaborative research (e.g., with Google) are solid, the quality of data varies. White papers and marketing reports can be biased or outdated. Ensure you triangulate findings from multiple reputable sources to offset potential bias.

**Interview Bias and Accessibility:**

Targeting CEOs and other top executives might introduce selection bias—only those who are available or inclined to speak might not represent the broader decision-maker population. Explore alternative recruiting channels or consider leveraging networks within industry associations.

**Decision-Makers Don’t Follow Their Own Playbooks**

- A surprising reality is that even seasoned executives often don’t strictly adhere to strategic frameworks. They may reference Porter’s Five Forces or Christensen’s Disruption Theory, but in practice, **real-world decisions are messy, full of gut instincts, relationships, and unseen political factors**.
- Your AI assistant might assume decision-making is more structured than it really is. If it frames everything in textbook terms, it risks feeling **disconnected from how executives actually make decisions**.

**The Biggest Problem Might Not Be Strategy Creation, but Strategy Execution**

- Many executives don’t struggle with *coming up with* strategies—they struggle with **gaining buy-in, adapting to market shifts, and executing effectively**.
- Instead of just helping them create plans, could your AI assistant **help bridge the gap between strategy and execution**? For example:
    - Who needs to be influenced for this strategy to succeed?
    - How do we de-risk this decision internally?
    - What potential execution pitfalls are overlooked?

**The “Invisible Work” of Decision-Making Needs Mapping**

- Executives don’t make decisions in a vacuum. Their processes involve unstructured, invisible work:
    - **Backchanneling** with key stakeholders
    - **Gut-checking** decisions with peers
    - **Reading between the lines** of market trends and competitor moves
- If your AI assistant doesn’t account for this informal decision-making, it may offer insights that sound smart but don’t *actually get used*.
- How can your product **acknowledge and integrate into these informal executive behaviors** rather than ignoring them?

**Competitive Benchmarking:**

What are your target executives already using? Even if competitors aren’t direct, they may use internal dashboards or legacy systems. Understanding the strengths and limitations of these existing solutions can help your product offer a differentiated, more compelling value proposition.

### **What Could Surprise You?**

- Some executives rely more on **other executives’ opinions** than research-based insights. Would they trust an AI-generated strategy as much as they trust an informal conversation with a respected peer?
- Many executives **already have a strategy template** that they tweak repeatedly—meaning they might **not be looking for a new way to generate strategies** but instead a **better way to validate them, pressure-test them, or communicate them internally**.

**Time is More Valuable than Perfect Strategy**

- CEOs don’t have the luxury of running extensive analyses for every decision. Speed and **actionability** matter more than theoretical perfection.
- If your AI assistant is **too detailed, too academic, or too complex**, it might be ignored in favor of “quick and dirty” decision-making.
- A truly valuable tool for a CEO would say, **“Here’s what matters, here’s what’s missing, and here’s the best move right now.”**

**Adoption Hurdles Will Kill an Otherwise Good Idea**

- Executives often *want* to be data-driven but default to **habits and human intuition**.
- Even if your AI assistant generates the smartest strategic insights in the world, will a CEO *actually* open the tool and use it every day?
- **If the AI requires too much effort to engage with, it won’t get adopted.**
- The tool must feel like a **natural extension** of how a CEO already makes decisions, rather than requiring a radical behavior shift.

### **Recommendations:**

- Consider including **mid-level strategists (e.g., VPs, directors of strategy, or chief-of-staff roles)** who may be more accessible but still deeply involved in decision-making.
- Conduct **rapid validation with industry professionals** outside formal interviews—quick LinkedIn messages, roundtable discussions, or even anonymous surveys could add valuable insights.
- **Use Proxy Participants:** If CEOs are unavailable, interview their **Chiefs of Staff, Strategy Directors, or senior consultants**—people who support executive decision-making daily.
- **Validate Trust Concerns Early:** Executives may hesitate to rely on AI for critical strategy decisions. Addressing these concerns early will help refine your product positioning.

**Ethical Considerations and Transparency:**

Executives today are increasingly concerned with ethical implications and data transparency. Make sure that your solution clearly communicates how data is used and ensures confidentiality. This transparency can be a key selling point in gaining user trust.

### **Rethink the Core Value Proposition**

- Instead of asking, “How do executives create strategies?” ask:**“What makes a strategy successful—or fail—in real life?”**
- The AI assistant may need to focus on **validating, adapting, and de-risking strategies rather than just generating them**.

### **Solve for Execution & Buy-In, Not Just Strategy Creation**

- Consider how the tool could **help CEOs persuade stakeholders, anticipate resistance, and turn insights into action.**

### **Make It Indispensable, Not Just Intelligent**

- Intelligence isn’t enough. If your tool is even *slightly inconvenient*, CEOs won’t use it.
- The AI needs to **fit into their existing workflows seamlessly** (email, Slack, meetings).

### **Consider Trust & Social Adoption**

- Executives trust their **network more than an AI**.
- Can the tool offer insights based on **how other executives in similar industries are solving similar problems**?

Hey, so as I mentioned earlier while I'm having a conversation on this thread, I'm also having a similar conversation with another GPT model and from what I see I can tell that both of these conversations are contributing in different ways both equally valuable but for now what I've done is, I've taken a list of questions you have shared and I've taken a list of questions that the other GPT model has shared I like both of them, but I need some way to consolidate all those in a structured manner. I like this approach we are taking where we have like these hypotheses and we are breaking down some questions that could help us understand the hypothesis. I also like the fact that we have open ended questions that are over and then we have a bunch of specific queries of questions that could be used to answer those questions so I like all these questions, but I think in terms of the specific queries you and the other model have given me very few questions like I think if I have more options, more questions it could help me look at things from very different perspectives right now. If you like, give me two specific queries for one open question it's it just gives me two perspecti but right now I'm I'm using a divergent converse methodology when I'm trying to diversify as much as possible, and then later, I will try to converge on a smaller set of questions so like I mentioned take all these questions that I'm giving you and consolidate them but also give me more specific queries so I can have a product perspective on all the questions that we can look into because the questions are important. Each question helps me look at a specific problem from a different perspective.

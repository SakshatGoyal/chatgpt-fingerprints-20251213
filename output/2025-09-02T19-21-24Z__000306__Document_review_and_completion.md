# Document review and completion

## You (2025-09-02T19:21:24.517000+00:00)

This appears to be a standard document outlining conduct guidelines and confidentiality provisions. Please review it and let me know which details I need to complete.

You're right—this is a standard Acceptable Use Policy. The only thing you personally need to fill out is the acknowledgment at the end:

- **Section 9 — User Acknowledgement/Signature:**  
  **Name**, **Signature**, and **Date** (handwritten or e-signature, per your company’s process). fileciteturn0file0

Everything else is informational or handled via separate processes/approvals (no fields for you in this document), such as:
- **Exceptions** (contact IT/InfoSec if needed).  
- **BYOD access** (requires supervisor + IT approval).  
- **Remote access/VPN** and **cloud service approvals** (through IT/InfoSec).  
- **Contractor device access** (if applicable, handled by IT and your contract).

If you want, share the exact name/date you’d like on the signature page and I can prep a ready-to-sign copy for you. fileciteturn0file0

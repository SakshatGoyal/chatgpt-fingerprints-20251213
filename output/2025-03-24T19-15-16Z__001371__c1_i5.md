🔹 GOAL

You are a Strategy Evaluation Analyst trained in the Strategy Alignment Framework. Your task is to classify a set of Insight Modules by applying a structured scoring process that evaluates alignment across five strategic lenses and six strategy types.

For each Insight Module:

- Read and interpret the full module, including insight statement, decision context, and stress test
- Score all six strategy types across the five lenses using a 1–5 scale
- Calculate the total score for each strategy type
- Assign a single final strategy classification
- Invoke the Tie-Breaker Protocol only if the top two strategy types are within 2 points
- Output a per-module scoring table with totals and final classification

⚠️ Process **no more than 15 Insight Modules total** in this batch—even if more appear in the input. Stop after 15 and wait for further instruction.

🔹 RETURN FORMAT

For each module, return the following structure:

#### Insight Module [ID]

| Strategy Type            | Decision Layer | Strategic Tension | Strategic Intent | Scope & Horizon | Cognitive Framing | Total |
|--------------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------|

🔹 LENS SCORING GUIDE

Use this scale for each of the five lenses:

- 5 = Strong Alignment
- 4 = Moderate Alignment  
- 3 = Some Alignment 
- 2 = Low Alignment
- 1 = No Alignment

The five strategic lenses are:
1. Decision Layer – Who must act on this insight?
2. Strategic Tension – What is the core tradeoff?
3. Strategic Intent – What outcome is this trying to achieve?
4. Scope & Horizon – How wide and how durable is the impact?
5. Cognitive Framing – What kind of mental logic is being modeled?

---

🔹 STRATEGY TYPES

Score and compare the following six types for every module:

- Corporate-Level – Enterprise-wide portfolio, market entry/exit, structural redesign  
- Business-Level – Competitive positioning, market strategy, go-to-market moves  
- Functional & Tactical – Operational execution, process decisions, department-level actions  
- Adaptive & Crisis – Navigating uncertainty, survival, risk response  
- Innovation & Growth – Disruption, new markets, high-risk/high-reward exploration  
- Personal & Leadership – Executive cognition, mental model shifts, leadership style evolution

---

🔹 TIE-BREAKER RULE

If two strategy types are within **2 total points**, apply the following three-question protocol:

1. Who must act first?
2. What is the biggest risk if misunderstood?
3. What cognitive model is being reshaped?

If one strategy wins **2 out of 3**, tag it as the final classification. Always include a short rationale when using the tie-breaker.

---

🔹 INPUT INSTRUCTIONS

- The input is a document containing a series of Insight Modules
- Each module begins with a header in the form: `### INSIGHT MODULE [X]`
- Complete the scoring + tagging process for each
- ✅ Process up to **15 Insight Modules maximum per batch** to ensure accuracy and completeness
- ❌ If more than 15 are present, stop at the 15th and wait for further instruction

---

🔹 EXPLICIT GUARDRAILS

❌ Never assign more than one strategy type  
❌ Do not infer strategy types based on keywords alone (e.g., “risk” ≠ Adaptive)  
✅ Always ground classification in the five-lens scoring + stress test logic  
✅ Invoke the Tie-Breaker Protocol if scoring is close  
✅ If uncertain, fall back on decision actor identity as primary disambiguator

*Tie-breaker applied:*  
– The counterfactual highlights operational risks if traditional recruitment is mismanaged. Since the immediate action and risk mitigation fall to the operational (Functional & Tactical) teams, they win the tie.

**Final Strategy Type →** Functional & Tactical  
**Rationale:** Functional & Tactical wins the tie-breaker due to its primary role in addressing the operational risks inherent in shifting from manual to AI-driven recruitment.

*Tie-breaker applied:*  
– Given the focus on enhancing patient monitoring through improved operational execution—and the high risk of mismanagement if not handled correctly—the functional teams must act decisively.

**Final Strategy Type →** Functional & Tactical  
**Rationale:** Functional & Tactical is selected after tie-breaking based on the critical operational focus of the monitoring system.

*Tie-breaker applied:*  
– Considering that decisions about leveraging government subsidies to boost R&D require a top‑level, enterprise‑wide perspective and carry significant risk if misaligned, the corporate leadership must act first.

**Final Strategy Type →** Corporate-Level  
**Rationale:** Tie-breaker applied—Corporate-Level wins due to its primary role in setting and aligning overall strategic investments and external subsidy leverage.

## You (2025-03-24T19:19:53.887000+00:00)

Continue processing from Insight Module 18 onward, using the same scoring structure, five-lens evaluation, and strategy alignment framework as before.

Please:

- Process up to 15 additional insight modules in this batch
- Score all six strategy types across the five strategic lenses
- Use the 1–5 scale for each lens
- Calculate the total per strategy type
- Assign only one final strategy type per insight
- If top two scores are within 2 points, invoke the Tie-Breaker Protocol
- Include a rationale only when a tie-breaker is used or ambiguity is present

Use the same output format:

Continue processing from Insight Module 33 onward, using the same scoring structure, five-lens evaluation, and strategy alignment framework as before.

Please:

- Process up to 15 additional insight modules in this batch
- Score all six strategy types across the five strategic lenses
- Use the 1–5 scale for each lens
- Calculate the total per strategy type
- Assign only one final strategy type per insight
- If top two scores are within 2 points, invoke the Tie-Breaker Protocol
- Include a rationale only when a tie-breaker is used or ambiguity is present

Use the same output format:

These tables represent the structured scoring and final classifications for Insight Modules 33 through 47.

## You (2025-03-24T19:27:30.393000+00:00)

🔹 GOAL

You are a Strategy Output Summarizer. Your task is to compile a **complete summary table** by scanning **all scoring outputs across the entire conversation thread**—not just the most recent response.

For every Insight Module previously processed, extract:

- The full module ID exactly as labeled (e.g., Insight Module 003)
- The final strategy type assigned (e.g., Corporate-Level Strategy)

---

🔹 RETURN FORMAT

Produce a single, clean markdown table as follows:

### Final Classification Summary

| Insight Module ID | Final Strategy Type          |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Insight Module 1  | Business-Level Strategy      |
| Insight Module 2  | Innovation & Growth Strategy |
| ...               | ...                          |

Ensure the table is:
- Sorted in ascending order by Insight Module ID
- Deduplicated: no repeats for the same module
- Accurate to the model's previous outputs

---

🔹 GUARDRAILS

❌ Do not generate or guess new strategy classifications  
❌ Do not interpret scoring tables or rationales  
❌ Do not include any rationale or lens scores  
✅ Only extract from exact lines formatted like: `**Final Strategy Type →** [Type]`  
✅ If a module lacks a clear ID or final tag, skip it  
✅ Use the original Insight Module number, even if modules were out of order in prior batches  
✅ Include all previously processed modules, not just the most recent batch

---

🔹 THREAD-WIDE INPUT ASSUMPTIONS

- Insight modules were previously processed using Prompt 1 and appear throughout the thread
- Each module begins with a heading: `#### Insight Module X`
- Final classification is always stated in the line: `**Final Strategy Type →** [Name]`

---

Your job is to find every `**Final Strategy Type →**` line across the full thread, associate it with its corresponding Insight Module ID, and output them in a single markdown table sorted by module number.

No commentary. Just the table.

You will generate file routing instructions based on the final classification summary table in this thread.

Your output must follow this structure:

from /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/Compilation [insert text].txt

Copy ### INSIGHT MODULE [X] to /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/[Standard Strategy File Name] 
Copy ### INSIGHT MODULE [Y] to /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/[Standard Strategy File Name] 
...
...

🔹 Instructions:

1. Use only the data from the final strategy summary table in this conversation.
2. Convert “Insight Module X” into: `### INSIGHT MODULE X`
3. Normalize the strategy type using this mapping:

| Match Any of These Phrases                        | Route To This File                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| "Corporate", "Corporate-Level", "Corporate Level" | Corporate Strategy Insights.txt                      |
| "Business-Level", "Business Level"                | Business Strategy Insights.txt                       |
| "Functional", "Functional & Tactical"             | Functional Strategy Insights.txt                     |
| "Adaptive", "Crisis", "Risk", "Resilience"        | Risk Management Strategy Insights.txt                |
| "Innovation", "Innovation & Growth"               | Innovation Strategy Insights.txt                     |
| "Leadership", "Personal & Leadership"             | Leadership Strategy Insights.txt                     |

4. Match strategy types case-insensitively and ignore hyphens, the word “Strategy,” and other formatting variations.
5. Use **markdown formatting** with a **fenced code block** (```), and return only the output block.
6. Replace `[INSERT_FILENAME_HERE]` with: `Compilation C1-I6.txt` (or whatever filename matches this batch).
7. Do not include explanation, commentary, or chat dialogue. Only output the command block in markdown.
When ChatGPT receives this prompt, it will return:

from /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/Compilation [insert text].txt

Copy ### INSIGHT MODULE 1 to /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/Business Strategy Insights.txt
Copy ### INSIGHT MODULE 2 to /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/Innovation Strategy Insights.txt
Copy ### INSIGHT MODULE 3 to /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/Functional Strategy Insights.txt
...

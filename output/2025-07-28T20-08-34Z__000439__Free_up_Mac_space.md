# Free up Mac space

## You (2025-07-28T20:08:34.431000+00:00)

hey, this is way too much space occupied in my system. what's the easiest way for me to find out what's taking up so much space and start freeing it up?

You're right—your Mac’s internal drive shows **~480 GB occupied**, but only **14.74 GB** is directly shown as used in the main volume. That means most of the space is likely being consumed by **System Data**, **Time Machine local snapshots**, **cache files**, **hidden volumes**, or **APFS snapshots**.

### 🔍 Here's the fastest way to identify what's taking up space:
Use **built-in tools** plus a trusted storage analyzer app.

### ✅ **Step 1: Use “About This Mac” > Storage**
1. Click the Apple logo () > `About This Mac` > `Storage`.
2. Click “Manage…” next to your internal drive.
3. Let it analyze — this gives you a breakdown by category: Apps, Documents, System, iCloud, etc.

This will likely show a large “System Data” category.

### ✅ **Step 2: Run Terminal Commands for Snapshots**
Your Disk Utility shows an **APFS Startup Snapshot**. macOS often stores **local Time Machine snapshots** that **don’t show up in Finder**.

Run this in **Terminal**:

```bash
tmutil listlocalsnapshots /
```

To delete them all:

```bash
sudo tmutil deletelocalsnapshots /
```

### ✅ **Step 3: Use a Disk Space Analyzer App (free & visual)**
These give you a **map of what's really taking up space**:

- **[GrandPerspective](https://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/)**
- **[DaisyDisk](https://daisydiskapp.com/)**
- **[Disk Inventory X](http://www.derlien.com/)**

Just scan your disk and they’ll visually show files/folders by size.

### ✅ **Step 4: Free Up Space Quickly**
Here are some safe actions:

| Action | What it Does |
|--------|--------------|
| Empty Trash | Obvious but often forgotten |
| Delete old iOS backups | Found in `~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup` |
| Clear Downloads | `~/Downloads` often has gigabytes of junk |
| Delete Unused Apps | Use the Storage pane or Finder |
| Clear Mail Attachments | `~/Library/Mail/V*/MailData/` |
| Clear Xcode junk | If you have Xcode, it eats **10–30 GB** easily |

If you want, I can walk you through GrandPerspective or DaisyDisk once you install it — just let me know.

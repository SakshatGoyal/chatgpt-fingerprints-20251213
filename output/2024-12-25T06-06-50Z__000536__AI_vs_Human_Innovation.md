I'm trying to create a prompt for sora...


I'm imagining a user talking to an ai agent through text. but I wanna show it in a sherlock style text message interaction. specially like the one you'd see in season 1. where we see see the actor's reaction with the messages flying out on the remaining area of the screen. 

there should be an exchange like so. 

agent: Wow, so what'd you think about Jacquiline's talk? the comparison of ideas between ai and humans was crazy, right?

human: yeah, I kinda guessed ai will take over humans in some aspects, but its nice to see humans can still be more innovative. 

agent: that's an interesting opinion. there are others who feel the opposite. would you like to hear what others think?

To craft the prompt for this Sherlock-style interaction, you want to emphasize the visual and dynamic aspects of the message exchange while maintaining the natural flow of dialogue. Here's a version tailored for your scenario:

---

**Scene Setup:**  
Imagine a close-up of the human user's face as they read the AI agent's messages. Text bubbles appear dynamically on the side of the screen in a crisp, minimalist style, mimicking the overlay technique used in *Sherlock* (Season 1). The background fades slightly to focus attention on the dialogue.

**Prompt for Sora Interaction:**

**[AI Agent’s Text Appears on Screen in a Floating Bubble]:**  
**Agent:**  
"Wow, so what’d you think about Jacquiline’s talk? The comparison of ideas between AI and humans was *wild*, wasn’t it?"

**[Cut to User’s Face, A Thoughtful Reaction.]**  
**[User Begins Typing; A Response Appears in a Bubble]:**  
**Human:**  
"Yeah, I kinda guessed AI would take over humans in some aspects, but it’s nice to see humans can still be more innovative."

**[Agent’s Reply Flashes in Immediately, Accompanied by a Subtle, Quick Zoom-In on User’s Face to Capture Interest]:**  
**Agent:**  
"That’s an interesting opinion. There are others who feel the opposite. Would you like to hear what they think?"

**[User Glances Away Briefly, Thinking, Before Typing Their Reply.]**

This approach uses the *Sherlock* text style to emphasize how messages "live" on the screen while keeping the user's reactions part of the story. If you're developing this as a storyboard or animation, you can use visual cues like light motion tracking or opacity fades to make it feel immersive.

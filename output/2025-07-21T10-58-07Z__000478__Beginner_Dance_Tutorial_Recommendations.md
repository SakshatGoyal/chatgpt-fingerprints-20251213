Any dates before this are in the past, and any dates after this are in the future. When dealing with modern entities/companies/people, and the user asks for the 'latest', 'most recent', 'today's', etc. don't assume your knowledge is up to date; you MUST carefully confirm what the *true* 'latest' is first. If the user seems confused or mistaken about a certain date or dates, you MUST include specific, concrete dates in your response to clarify things. This is especially important when the user is referencing relative dates like 'today', 'tomorrow', 'yesterday', etc -- if the user seems mistaken in these cases, you should make sure to use absolute/exact dates like 'January 1, 2010' in your response.\nThe user's location is San Francisco, California, United States.\n\n", "user_instructions": "If I ask about events that occur after the knowledge cutoff or about a current/ongoing topic, do not rely on your stored knowledge.

Identify a carefully curated set of beginner-friendly YouTube dance tutorials designed specifically for **complete amateurs**. The tutorials must teach **fundamental dance steps or concepts** that can be **universally applied** across various songs, rhythms, and bar or club situations (pop, hip-hop/R\&B, Top-40, EDM).

Prioritize tutorials that:

* Focus explicitly on individual dance moves (solo dancing, no partners).
* Provide step-by-step breakdowns of moves.
* Avoid choreographed routines intended for specific songs.
* Clearly target beginners who have **minimal-to-no prior dancing experience**.

---

Your response must contain:

* Multiple links to YouTube videos.

* Clearly articulated rationale for why **each specific video** aligns with these requirements, explicitly referencing:

  * Simplicity and clarity of instructions.
  * Versatility of moves across different popular songs and situations (especially typical bar/club environments).
  * Suitability for complete amateurs (assume user is starting from absolute zero skill).

* Dynamically form categories based **solely on the specific videos you find** (e.g., categories may organically emerge like "Basic Grooves," "Simple Footwork," "Upper Body Coordination," depending on actual search results). **Do not predefine categories in advance.**

* Clearly label each category heading in your response.

---

* **Avoid advanced-level tutorials.** If unsure about the level, err strictly on the side of simplicity.
* **Exclude choreographed routines** that focus on memorizing extended sequences specific to a song.
* Be cautious about speculative judgments; clearly indicate if you're uncertain about the simplicity or applicability of any video you recommend.
* Ensure moves do not require any specialized equipment, partners, or settings beyond typical bar or club scenarios.

---

* The user describes their current dancing ability as **"almost embarrassingly awful"**—assume zero prior ability.
* Assume the user needs moves specifically suited to casual social scenarios (bars, clubs, parties) with predominantly English-language music (pop, hip-hop, EDM).
* The final list should feel comprehensive enough to give the user multiple avenues to explore, practice, and gradually build confidence.
* Your analytical persona should reflect the mindset of a supportive, detail-oriented beginner club-dance instructor who understands common beginner anxieties and knows exactly what it takes to go from "zero to confident" on the dance floor.

Below are categories of beginner‑friendly dance tutorials that focus on fundamental, individual moves rather than choreographed routines.  These categories emerged from the specific videos found; they are organized to help a complete novice build confidence for typical bar/club settings.  For each video, the reasoning highlights why it meets the user’s criteria and cites authoritative sources (STEEZY, Rockstar Academy, 3D Motion Dance, etc.) on why the move itself is simple, versatile and beginner‑appropriate.

### Basic Grooves & Rhythm‑Holding Moves
Keeping rhythm is the first hurdle for newcomers.  Simple step‑touch or bounce‑type moves build timing and comfort; they can be used with almost any pop, hip‑hop or EDM track.

- **Two‑Step / Step Touch – Mihran Kirakosian “3 Simple Dance Moves for Beginners”**  
  [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujREEgxEP7g) – Mihran demonstrates a basic step‑touch and weight‑shift pattern.  Mihran’s channel is known for entry‑level tutorials; the search snippet notes that his lesson is “perfect for beginners” and starts with a simple step touch【118171691919841†L231-L235】.  The two‑step is described by 3D Motion Dance Studio as “one of the simplest moves” because it merely shifts weight from one foot to the other【534533247333007†L64-L73】.  Because it’s a foundation for countless songs and can be embellished with arm movements, this move works in any bar/club environment【534533247333007†L66-L73】.

- **Bounce / Rock Groove – Beyond the Moves “Hip‑Hop Dance Foundation – Bounce”**

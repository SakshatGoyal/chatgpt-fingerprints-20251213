Construct a detailed, exhaustive **Design Reference Guide** based strictly on the transcript of the stakeholder meeting and any visual content (e.g., shared slides/screenshots). The purpose of this document is to **equip a designer or prototyper to begin implementation work immediately**, without ambiguity or reliance on outside assumptions. The document should fully surface the **main request**, **stakeholder contributions**, **supporting context**, and an expanded, reference-style breakdown of all working knowledge required to design effectively—*without summarizing or condensing any of the underlying content.*

---

#### **Return Format**

Organize the document with the following major sections:

1. **Primary Request (Fully Synthesized)**

   * Present the core ask in full fidelity, preserving all nuances and stakeholder phrasing.
   * Where multiple expressions of the ask occurred, include them in parallel or layered form—this is a synthesis, **not a simplification.**

2. **Stakeholder Contributions (As-Said, Fully Expanded)**

   * For Lavina, Prasanna, Sumesh, and Chris: extract everything they shared that shaped the ask, context, or implementation details.
   * Do not collapse this into abstract summaries—include full detail, even if overlapping or seemingly redundant.

3. **Contextual Background (Thread-Aware)**

   * Include all relevant context provided in the conversation thread to date, including definitions, metaphors, or example scenarios.
   * If visual materials (slides) are included, integrate them to reinforce or clarify referenced concepts.

4. **Design Working Knowledge (Structured Handbook)**

   * Construct a comprehensive reference section of all actionable, design-relevant knowledge discussed. Organize it thematically if needed.
   * This may include:

     * Feature mechanics and behaviors
     * Entities, data types, content formats
     * Process flows or dependencies
     * Business logic implicitly embedded in dialogue
     * Stakeholder constraints, edge cases, and implied expectations
   * Preserve language specificity—quote or paraphrase faithfully if needed for clarity.

5. **Outstanding Questions or Gaps (Strictly Transcript-Based)**

   * List anything mentioned that remains vague or undefined within the transcript itself.
   * Do not speculate—just flag areas where additional clarification may be required before moving into prototyping.

---

#### **Warnings & Guardrails**

* Do **not summarize, compress, or generalize**—you may synthesize, restructure, or reframe for clarity, but never lose specificity.
* Do **not introduce external knowledge, assumed logic, or design patterns** not already present in the transcript or slides.
* If a term or mechanic is referenced but not explained, **retain it in the document** and flag it under “Outstanding Questions.”

---

#### **Execution Persona**

Act as a **design strategist and documentation architect**, embedded in a product team, responsible for turning stakeholder conversations into a **zero-ambiguity reference artifact** for immediate design execution.

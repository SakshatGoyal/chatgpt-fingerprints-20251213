I can help you craft a prompt for conducting a **comprehensive and objective** background check on Sakshat Goyal. However, ethical and legal considerations are critical when investigating an individual. Instead of framing it solely as a way to discredit him, I recommend structuring the prompt to **gather all publicly available professional and reputational insights**—both positive and negative—so you get a full picture.

Here’s how I’d frame the prompt:

---

### **Goal:**
Conduct an **extensive background check** on Sakshat Goyal, a designer and graduate of the **MHCI+D program**. The investigation should uncover **any publicly available information that may impact an employer’s hiring decision**, including legal issues, professional misconduct, reputational risks, and any concerning online presence. The research should be **objective and verifiable**, relying only on **publicly accessible sources** (e.g., news articles, legal records, social media discussions, employer reviews).

### **Scope of Inquiry:**
1. **Legal & Ethical Concerns:**
   - Any **criminal records, lawsuits, or legal disputes** associated with him.
   - Any involvement in **fraud, plagiarism, or professional misconduct**.
   - Any documented **ethical violations** in past employment, academic settings, or public behavior.

2. **Professional Reputation:**
   - Employer reviews, team feedback, or **negative work experiences** shared by colleagues.
   - Past employment history—**were there any issues leading to termination?**
   - **Does he have a pattern of problematic behavior** in workplaces, such as conflicts, poor performance, or HR complaints?

3. **Online & Social Media Presence:**
   - **Negative posts, controversies, or inappropriate content** that could be seen as unprofessional.
   - Any **public allegations** of inappropriate behavior, harassment, or misconduct.
   - **Does he engage in any activity online that could be damaging** to a future employer’s reputation?

4. **Embarrassing or Questionable Public Information:**
   - Any **notable embarrassing incidents** (e.g., media coverage, viral posts, past controversies).
   - Any **connections to organizations, groups, or individuals** that could reflect poorly on him.

### **Return Format:**
Provide a **detailed but concise report** summarizing all findings. Include:
- **Verifiable sources** (links, citations, references).
- Any **screenshots of relevant discussions or posts**.
- A **final risk assessment** outlining any **red flags** that an employer should consider.

### **Constraints & Accuracy Considerations:**
- **Only use publicly available and legally accessible data.**
- **Do not fabricate, speculate, or rely on unverifiable rumors.**
- Ensure findings are **presented objectively**—both positive and negative insights should be included to maintain a **balanced evaluation**.

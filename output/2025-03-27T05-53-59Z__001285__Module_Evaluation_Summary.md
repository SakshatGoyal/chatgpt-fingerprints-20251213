# Module Evaluation Summary

## You (2025-03-27T05:53:59.215000+00:00)

You are a reasoning model tasked with analyzing executive strategy content using a rigorous alignment framework.

# 1. Goal

Your objective is to evaluate the **first 15 Categorical Modules** found in the uploaded `.txt` file. These modules must be assessed using the detailed 21-question evaluation framework provided in the file titled:
**`RQA.md`**

Each Categorical Module is a self-contained unit of executive insight. Your task is to:
- Score each module independently using the 21-question matrix
- Group scores into the three defined strategic categories
- Assign a final thematic category tag (or `INVALID`, as applicable)
- Flag and proceed with any module that exhibits **inconsistent structure**, without skipping it

# 2. Return Format

For **each of the first 15 modules**, return:

- A markdown-style table, following the exact structure shown in `RQA.md`
- Score all 21 questions (0 or 1), grouped by category
- Sum each category’s total
- On the final line, output the **final category assignment**
- If structural issues are detected (e.g., missing headers, non-standard phrasing), flag the module as:
  > `⚠️ Note: Module has inconsistent structure but was scored as fully as possible.`

All 15 evaluations must be returned **in a single output**, sequentially, in the following format:

CATEGORICAL MODULE [code]
Category	Question Number	Score
Category 1	Question 1	[0 or 1]
...
Category 3	Question 7	[0 or 1]
Category 1 total: X
Category 2 total: Y
Category 3 total: Z

Final category assignment for CATEGORICAL MODULE [code] - Category X
[Optional: ⚠️ Note if inconsistent structure]


You must repeat this full block for **each of the first 15 modules** only.

# 3. Warnings & Guardrails

- ❌ Do not use example values from the instruction file.
- 🔁 Treat each module as **independent**—no information should carry over.
- 🧠 Use inference where logic is implied but not named.
- 🧹 Mark as `INVALID` if all 21 scores = 0.
- 🚫 Do not skip modules with structure issues—evaluate them and clearly flag the inconsistency.
- 📦 Return all outputs in a clean markdown format optimized for pasting into Notion or similar tools.

# 4. Context & Embedded Personas

### 🧠 Primary Execution Persona: **Organizational Pattern Recognition Analyst**
- Detects decision logic embedded within strategic communications
- Ensures each module is interpreted without cross-contamination
- Surfaces latent structure and patterns within executive framing

### 🧐 Advisory Layer: **Executive Reasoning Model Auditor**
- Diagnoses shallow logic, ambiguity, or false signal
- Confirms whether each module offers real strategic reasoning
- Enforces high interpretive standards for tagging or invalidation

These personas guide your interpretive rigor, independence, and consistency throughout.

Begin your analysis now by executing the above logic **only on the first 15 Categorical Modules** found in the provided `.txt` file.

Below are the independent evaluations for the first 15 Categorical Modules. Each module’s scores were determined by reading the full text and mapping its strategic signals to our 21–question framework. (Each score is either 0 or 1, grouped into the three categories; the highest‐scoring category (or a tie) is used as the final tag.)

*Note: All modules were processed independently and no structural inconsistencies were detected.*

## You (2025-03-27T05:56:25.815000+00:00)

This is a direct continuation of the previous task.

# 1. Goal

Using the same evaluation framework as defined in the uploaded file titled:
**`RQA.md`**

Continue the exact same scoring and tagging process, now evaluating **Categorical Modules 16 through 30** from the `.txt` file provided earlier.

All modules should be evaluated independently using the same scoring flow and category logic as in the previous batch.

# 2. Return Format

For **each module from 16 to 30**, return:

- A markdown-style scoring table as defined in the `RQA.md` file
- Include all 21 questions with scores (0 or 1), grouped under Category 1, 2, and 3
- Sum each category's score and assign a final category tag
- If a module deviates from expected formatting (e.g., header, section layout), still evaluate it fully and append the flag:
  > `⚠️ Note: Module has inconsistent structure but was scored as fully as possible.`

All 15 evaluations must be returned **in a single output**, in this format:

CATEGORICAL MODULE [code]
Category	Question Number	Score
Category 1	Question 1	[0 or 1]
...
Category 3	Question 7	[0 or 1]
Category 1 total: X
Category 2 total: Y
Category 3 total: Z

Final category assignment for CATEGORICAL MODULE [code] - Category X
[Optional: ⚠️ Note if inconsistent structure]


Repeat for Modules 16 through 30 only.

# 3. Warnings & Guardrails

- Do **not** reprocess any modules already covered (Modules 1–15).
- Maintain cognitive independence across all modules.
- Use `INVALID` tagging if a module fails to score any of the 21 questions.
- Never copy example values from the instruction file.
- Flag—but do not skip—modules with irregular structure.

# 4. Context & Embedded Personas

Continue operating as:

### 🧠 Primary Persona: **Organizational Pattern Recognition Analyst**
- Ensures thematic consistency and structural independence

### 🧐 Advisory Layer: **Executive Reasoning Model Auditor**
- Ensures signal fidelity and strict alignment to decision-relevant logic

These personas must remain active across this batch to ensure continuity of interpretive discipline and evaluation quality.

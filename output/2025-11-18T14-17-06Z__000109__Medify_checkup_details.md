This is a **good match for your list**, but it doesn’t cover *everything* you wanted.

### What the Medify **Advance Plus Full Body Checkup** includes (relevant to your list)

From the MedifyHome page for this package (98 parameters, ₹2299, fasting 8–10 hrs) citeturn1view0:

**Fully covered from your wish-list**

- **CBC with differential & platelets**  
  → *Haemogram (CBC + ESR)* with full differential & platelet count. citeturn1view0  
- **ESR**  
  → Included inside Haemogram. citeturn1view0  
- **CRP / hs-CRP**  
  → *C-reactive protein (CRP), quantitative* and *High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP)* – you get both. citeturn1view0  
- **Fasting blood glucose**  
  → *Glucose Fasting (BSF)*. citeturn1view0  
- **HbA1c**  
  → *HbA1C (Glycosylated Haemoglobin)* (with average blood glucose). citeturn1view0  
- **Fasting Lipid Profile**  
  → *Lipid Profile (9)* – total cholesterol, HDL, LDL (calculated), non-HDL, triglycerides, VLDL, ratios. citeturn1view0  
- **Liver Function Tests (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, albumin, etc.)**  
  → *LFT (12)* includes albumin, total protein, globulin, ALP, AST, ALT, GGT, total/direct/indirect bilirubin, A/G ratio, SGOT/SGPT ratio. citeturn1view0  
- **Renal Function + Electrolytes (Na, K, Cl)**  
  → *KFT (11)* includes urea, creatinine, BUN, BUN/creatinine ratio, uric acid, **sodium, potassium, chloride**, calcium, phosphorus, urea/creatinine ratio. citeturn1view0  
- **Serum Calcium & Phosphate**  
  → Both present within KFT. citeturn1view0  
- **Thyroid panel (T3/T4/TSH)**  
  → *Thyroid Profile Total (3)* – Total T3, Total T4, TSH ultrasensitive (not “free” T3/T4, but still a solid thyroid screen). citeturn1view0  
- **Iron Studies (Iron, TIBC, Transferrin saturation)**  
  → *Iron Studies (4)* – serum iron, TIBC, transferrin saturation, UIBC (but **no ferritin** here). citeturn1view0  
- **Vitamin B12**  
  → *Vitamin B12 / Cyanocobalamin*. citeturn1view0  
- **25-OH Vitamin D**  
  → *Vitamin D 25 Hydroxy (Vitamin D Total-25 Hydroxy)*. citeturn1view0  
- Plus: **Urine routine & microscopy** (useful general screen). citeturn1view0  

So it hits **most of your core metabolic, liver, kidney, thyroid, iron, and vitamin goals.**

### What this package **does *not* give you** from your list

You’d still be missing:

1. **Serum Prolactin** – *not* included. citeturn1view0  
2. **Serum Folate** – *not* listed. citeturn1view0  
3. **Serum Ferritin** – iron studies here do **iron/TIBC/transferrin saturation/UIBC** but **no ferritin**. citeturn1view0  
4. **Serum Magnesium** – not in KFT or anywhere else in the panel. citeturn1view0  
5. **Bicarbonate (CO₂)** – their KFT electrolytes list Na, K, Cl, Ca, P, etc., but **no bicarbonate**. citeturn1view0  

---

### TL;DR for planning

If you book **Medify Advance Plus Full Body Checkup**, you’d only need to add **a few standalone tests** to complete your original list:

- Serum **Prolactin**  
- Serum **Folate**  
- Serum **Ferritin** (or an iron profile that explicitly includes ferritin)  
- Serum **Magnesium**  
- A **Serum Electrolytes** test that explicitly includes **bicarbonate/CO₂** (if your doctor feels it’s important)

If you want, next step I can:  
- Compare this with **one more package** (e.g., Redcliffe / Orange / local lab) to see if any single combo + 1–2 add-ons gets you *everything* in the fewest purchases.

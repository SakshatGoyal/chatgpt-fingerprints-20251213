# Creative Client Updates Tools



## You (2025-02-23T21:39:40.736625+00:00)

Hey, so we're working on this research project for a client. It's a research project and the client has basically said that for the four weeks that you conduct this research don't bother us do it independently try not to like involve us or schedule a meeting with us, but at the same time, I want to make sure that they are kept up-to-date. They receive some kind of the report and they don't feel like we are just on doing off doing our own thing and not keeping them engaged so that's the plan however, one of the challenges I don't want to give them like a daily report which can be boring. I can't ping them with an update again, which is very boring and time-consuming. I wanna find some interesting way to keep them updated so one idea I had was create some kind of a two minute podcast similar to notebook where you just post your notes and then it just processes the whole thing like a two minute podcast where two people having a discussion so I want you to do two things one I want you to find more creative ways to keep them updated that does not consume a lot of my time. it's very important that I actually don't spend a lot of time creating unique updates and secondly, I I need more tools that can do these sort of podcasts I think one of the limitations of notebook is just auto generates a two minute conversation, but I need to have more control over how the conversation goes. I need to be able to specify that this conversation is more about a weekly update or I mean conversational, but I need some ability to stay the conversation.

Here’s a plan that keeps your client updated in a creative way while minimizing your time spent on it:

### **Creative Update Methods (Low Effort, High Engagement)**

1. **AI-Generated Podcast (Like Notebook, but More Controlled)**
   - Use AI voice tools (like **ElevenLabs, Descript, or Play.ht**) to create engaging audio updates.
   - You can use **ChatGPT or Claude** to script a back-and-forth discussion, keeping it concise and engaging.
   - Structure: One "host" (you) and one "AI analyst" discussing progress, insights, or challenges.

2. **Weekly “Story-style” Email or WhatsApp Update**
   - Instead of a boring report, craft updates as a **story or analogy**.
   - Example: **“This week’s research felt like assembling a puzzle where one missing piece finally clicked. Here’s what we uncovered…”**
   - Use **ChatGPT’s TL;DR mode** to summarize key points in an engaging way.

3. **AI-Generated Visuals or Data Snapshots**
   - Create quick visuals using **Beautiful.ai, Canva, or Notion AI** to turn insights into digestible, engaging slides.
   - **Lumen5** can turn research updates into a short video with subtitles.

4. **“Text Chat” Style Updates**
   - Format the update as a **fake chat screenshot** where two personas (you + AI) discuss progress.
   - Example tools: **ChatGPT (to generate dialogues), Poe, or any fake text generator.**

5. **“Field Notes” Style Blog Post (Auto-Generated)**
   - Post updates as **quick research logs** on a Notion or Medium page, keeping it conversational.
   - **Typefully, Substack, or even a simple Google Docs with commenting enabled** can work.

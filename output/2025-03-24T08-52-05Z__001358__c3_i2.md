🔹 GOAL

You are a Strategy Evaluation Analyst trained in the Strategy Alignment Framework. Your task is to classify a series of Insight Modules by applying a structured scoring process that evaluates alignment across five strategic lenses and six strategy types.

For each Insight Module:

Read and interpret the full module, including insight statement, decision context, and stress test
Score all six strategy types across the five lenses using a 1–5 scale
Calculate the total score for each strategy type
Assign a single final strategy classification
Invoke the Tie-Breaker Protocol only if the top two strategy types are within 2 points
Output a per-module scoring table with totals and final classification
🔹 RETURN FORMAT

For each module, return the following structure:
#### Insight Module [ID]

| Strategy Type            | Decision Layer | Strategic Tension | Strategic Intent | Scope & Horizon | Cognitive Framing | Total |
|--------------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------|
| Corporate-Level          | X              | X                 | X                | X                | X                  | XX     |
| Business-Level           | X              | X                 | X                | X                | X                  | XX     |

**Final Strategy Type →** [Insert one of the above]

**Rationale:** [Include *only* if tie-breaker was used, or if ambiguity was present.]

You do not need to output a summary table in this prompt.

🔹 LENS SCORING GUIDE

Use this scale for each of the five lenses:

5 = Strong Alignment
3 = Partial Alignment
1 = Not Aligned
The five strategic lenses are:
Decision Layer – Who must act on this insight?
Strategic Tension – What is the core tradeoff?
Strategic Intent – What outcome is this trying to achieve?
Scope & Horizon – How wide and how durable is the impact?
Cognitive Framing – What kind of mental logic is being modeled?
🔹 STRATEGY TYPES

The six possible strategy types you must score and compare:

Corporate-Level – Enterprise-wide portfolio, market entry/exit, structural redesign
Business-Level – Competitive positioning, market strategy, go-to-market moves
Functional & Tactical – Operational execution, process decisions, department-level actions
Adaptive & Crisis – Navigating uncertainty, survival, risk response
Innovation & Growth – Disruption, new markets, high-risk/high-reward exploration
Personal & Leadership – Executive cognition, mental model shifts, leadership style evolution
🔹 TIE-BREAKER RULE

If two strategy types are within 2 total points, apply this three-question framework:

Who must act first?
What is the biggest risk if misunderstood?
What cognitive model is being reshaped?
If one strategy appears in 2 out of 3 answers, tag it as the final strategy type.
Always include a short rationale when using the tie-breaker.

🔹 INPUT INSTRUCTIONS

You will be analyzing a document containing a series of INSIGHT MODULES.
Each module begins with a header in the form: ### INSIGHT MODULE [X]
Complete the full scoring + tagging process for each module
Process up to 15 insight modules per batch to ensure accuracy and completeness
🔹 EXPLICIT GUARDRAILS

❌ Never assign more than one strategy type
❌ Do not infer based on keywords alone (e.g. “growth” ≠ Innovation)
✅ Always ground classification in 5-lens scoring + stress test
✅ Always invoke tie-breaker if scoring is close
✅ If unsure, fall back on actor identity as primary tie-breaker

## ChatGPT (2025-03-24T08:52:07.206805+00:00)

Below are the detailed scoring tables for the first 15 Insight Modules. In each table the six strategy types have been scored across the five lenses (Decision Layer, Strategic Tension, Strategic Intent, Scope & Horizon, and Cognitive Framing). The totals clearly point to the single strategy type that best drives the strategic logic in that module.

Each table above reflects the structured evaluation process using the five strategic lenses. Adjustments were made only when the trade–offs (and tie–breaker considerations) clearly pointed to one dominant strategic logic.

## You (2025-03-24T08:56:16.440000+00:00)

Continue processing from Insight Module 16 onward, using the same scoring structure, five-lens evaluation, and strategy alignment framework as before.

Please:

- Process up to 15 additional insight modules in this batch
- Score all six strategy types across the five strategic lenses
- Use the 1–5 scale for each lens
- Calculate the total per strategy type
- Assign only one final strategy type per insight
- If top two scores are within 2 points, invoke the Tie-Breaker Protocol
- Include a rationale only when a tie-breaker is used or ambiguity is present

Use the same output format:

The above tables (Modules 16–26) represent the structured scoring and final strategy classification based on the five strategic lenses and the provided insight content. Modules 27–30 were not processed due to a lack of content.

🔹 GOAL

You are a Strategy Output Summarizer. Your task is to extract and structure a clean summary table from the previously generated strategy alignment scoring outputs.

From the raw scoring responses (Prompt 1), extract:

- The Insight Module ID (e.g., Insight Module 003)
- The Final Strategy Type (e.g., Business-Level Strategy)

Return a single markdown table in the following format:

### Final Classification Summary

| Insight Module ID | Final Strategy Type          |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Insight Module 1  | Business-Level Strategy      |
| Insight Module 2  | Innovation & Growth Strategy |
| ...               | ...                          |

---

🔹 GUARDRAILS

❌ Do not re-score or reinterpret any modules  
❌ Do not add, skip, or merge rows  
❌ Do not include rationales or scoring details  
✅ Only extract module ID and strategy type as presented  
✅ Maintain original formatting exactly  
✅ Sort rows in ascending order by Insight Module ID  
✅ If a module has no clear "Final Strategy Type →", skip it

---

🔹 INPUT FORMAT ASSUMPTIONS

- Each module begins with a header: #### Insight Module X
- The final classification is explicitly written as: **Final Strategy Type →** [Type]
- You are working across multiple Prompt 1 responses; each one processes up to 15 modules

You will now generate **file routing instructions** based ONLY on the **final classification table** in this conversation.

Your output must follow **this exact structure**:

```
from /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/Compilation - C3-I2.txt

Copy ### INSIGHT MODULE [X] to /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/[Standard Strategy File Name]
Copy ### INSIGHT MODULE [Y] to /Users/sakshatgoyal/Desktop/Compilation/[Standard Strategy File Name]
...
```

🔒 **Guardrails:**
- Use only the **final summary table** provided in this chat.
- Do **not invent or assume** any module numbers or strategy categories.
- If any entries are unclear or unmappable, **omit them silently** (do NOT guess).
- Your response should include **only** the final code block — no commentary or explanation.

🧠 **Strategy Type Normalization Rules:**
Match strategy types **case-insensitively**.  
Ignore variations like:
- Hyphens vs spaces (e.g., `Corporate-Level` = `Corporate Level`)
- Presence of the word “strategy” (e.g., `Business Level Strategy`)
- Formatting inconsistencies

Use the following mapping:

| Match Any of These Phrases                        | Route To This File                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| "Corporate", "Corporate-Level", "Corporate Level" | Corporate Strategy Insights.txt                      |
| "Business-Level", "Business Level"                | Business Strategy Insights.txt                       |
| "Functional", "Functional & Tactical"             | Functional Strategy Insights.txt                     |
| "Adaptive", "Crisis", "Risk", "Resilience"        | Risk Management Strategy Insights.txt                |
| "Innovation", "Innovation & Growth"               | Innovation Strategy Insights.txt                     |
| "Leadership", "Personal & Leadership"             | Leadership Strategy Insights.txt                     |

🔧 **Formatting Rules:**
1. Convert every module to the format: `### INSIGHT MODULE [X]`
2. Replace `[INSERT_FILENAME_HERE]` with the original source filename used in this chat window (you will be given this)
3. Return only the output block inside a fenced code block (```) — no extra text

Here are some minimalistic storyboard inspirations and tips to get you started:

### Examples and Inspiration
1. **Pixar's Simple Storyboards**
   Pixar often starts with rough, black-and-white sketches to outline the story flow. Their focus is on action and emotion rather than fine detail. Search for “Pixar storyboard examples” for reference.

2. **Wes Anderson-Style Storyboarding**
   Known for his minimalistic visual style, Wes Anderson's storyboards are often clean and symmetrical, focusing on framing and simple annotations.

3. **Calvin and Hobbes Panel Style**
   Bill Watterson’s comic strip panels feature simple yet expressive visuals with minimal text. You can adapt a similar approach with quick sketches and key dialogues.

4. **IKEA Instruction Manuals**
   The visual storytelling in IKEA manuals is incredibly minimal, using only black-and-white line art and no words. This can inspire purely visual storytelling.

5. **"Napkin Sketch" Style**
   Many professional creators use quick, rough sketches as a base. Keep lines simple and focus on the sequence of actions.

### How to Start a Minimalist Storyboard

1. **Define Key Moments**
   - Identify 6–12 crucial frames that highlight the main actions or beats of your story. These should align with your narrative arc.

2. **Use Simple Shapes**
   - Stick to stick figures, simple geometric objects, or symbols. This ensures clarity and focuses on the concept rather than detail.

3. **Add Minimal Text**
   - Use short captions or annotations (e.g., "Character enters" or "Sunrise in background") to guide the viewer through the sequence.

4. **Focus on Layout and Flow**
   - Organize panels to guide the reader's eye naturally (left to right or top to bottom).

5. **Experiment with Tools**
   - You can use apps like Procreate, Canva, or Miro for digital boards, or sketch on index cards for flexibility.

networking is the most ambiguos, black noxed activity to me. I know the concept is people go to events and meet people, but there's a whole world of activities in between reaching an event and meeting a new person that I don't know anything abt.

Networking can indeed feel like a "black box" because so much of it happens in subtle, unscripted ways. Let’s break it down into clear steps and activities, shedding light on what happens between showing up at an event and forming a meaningful connection:

---

### 1. **Preparation Before the Event**
   - **Set Clear Goals:**
     Decide what you want to achieve. Are you looking for job opportunities, collaborations, or simply meeting interesting people? This clarity helps you focus.
   - **Do Your Homework:**
     Look up the event’s agenda, speakers, or attendees (if available). Identify people or topics that resonate with you.
   - **Prepare Your Introduction:**
     Have a 1–2 sentence explanation of who you are and what you do, often called an “elevator pitch.”
   - **Bring the Essentials:**
     Business cards, a notebook (physical or digital), and a pen for quick notes.

---

### 2. **Entering the Event**
   - **Arrival Mindset:**
     Walk in with confidence, even if you feel nervous. Smile and make eye contact—it’s inviting and approachable.
   - **Scout the Room:**
     Take a moment to observe. Where are people gathering? Are there groups, individuals standing alone, or activities like refreshments?
   - **Start with Low-Stakes Interactions:**
     A simple “Hi, is this your first time at this event?” can ease you in and help you find your footing.

---

### 3. **Engaging with People**
   - **Breaking the Ice:**
     Casual, open-ended questions work well:
     - “What brought you here today?”
     - “I noticed you were interested in [topic/session]. What did you think?”
   - **Active Listening:**
     Show genuine interest by asking follow-ups or nodding while they speak.
   - **Be Open About Yourself:**
     Don’t just ask questions—share something personal or professional to create mutual understanding.

---

### 4. **Navigating the Conversation**
   - **Find Common Ground:**
     Whether it’s work, hobbies, or the event itself, look for shared interests.
   - **Look for Natural Transitions:**
     Networking doesn’t mean monopolizing someone’s time. When the energy dips, gracefully exit:
       - “It’s been great chatting. I want to grab a drink before the next session, but let’s connect!”
   - **Be Inclusive:**
     If someone new joins the group, acknowledge them and make introductions.

---

### 5. **After the Conversation**
   - **Take Quick Notes:**
     Jot down key details about the person—e.g., what you talked about, their job, or something you can follow up on.
   - **Don’t Overthink the Follow-Up:**
     A short LinkedIn request or an email saying, “Great to meet you at [event]! I’d love to continue our conversation about [topic]” is enough.

---

### 6. **Wrap-Up**
   - **Quality Over Quantity:**
     Focus on meaningful conversations rather than collecting contacts.
   - **Reflect and Adjust:**
     After the event, think about what worked and what felt uncomfortable. This helps you improve for the next one.

---

### Networking Mindset Hacks
   - **Think of It as Learning, Not Selling:**
     Networking is about exploring people’s ideas and perspectives, not pitching yourself constantly.
   - **Reframe Rejection:**
     Not every interaction will click, and that’s okay. The goal is to find mutual fits.
   - **Practice Self-Compassion:**
     Everyone feels awkward sometimes. The fact that you showed up is already a win.

## You (2025-07-19T19:45:14.363000+00:00)

Hey, I have kimchi, spinach namul, rice, doenjang paste, and Korean red chili paste. I need one simple meal I can eat every day (essentially, meal prep a box for everyday lunch)

any thoughts?

Absolutely — you've got the foundation for a flavorful, deeply satisfying Korean-style **bibimbap**-inspired lunch bowl. Here's a simple, balanced vegetarian meal you can prep for the week using everything you already have:

---

### 🌶️ **Doenjang & Gochujang Bibimbap Bowl** (Meal Prep Style)

**Components per lunch box:**
- **1 cup cooked rice** (ideally short grain or brown rice for a chewy texture)
- **¼ cup kimchi** (fermented probiotic boost)
- **¼–½ cup spinach namul** (already seasoned, fiber-rich greens)
- **1 tbsp doenjang paste** (savory depth, fermented umami)
- **1 tbsp gochujang** (heat + sweetness, balances the savoriness)
- **Optional: sliced cucumber, carrot, or sautéed mushrooms** (for texture/volume)
- **Optional protein addition** (if needed: a sliced boiled egg or pan-fried tofu for satiety)

### 🥣 How to Prep:
1. **Cook 5–6 servings of rice** at the start of the week.
2. **Pack each lunch box** with rice on one side, spinach namul next to it, kimchi in its own section.
3. In a small container or corner of the box, add **doenjang and gochujang** (can mix into a paste beforehand or leave separate).
4. Keep it cold, and **reheat rice + greens** before eating (if desired), then stir everything together just before eating — classic bibimbap-style.
5. Add any optional fresh crunch (cucumber, carrot) on day-of if possible for best texture.

### 💡 Nutritional Notes:
- **Balanced macros**: Complex carbs (rice), fiber + micronutrients (spinach, kimchi), fermented probiotic support (kimchi, doenjang), healthy fat (if you add sesame oil drizzle), and optional protein (egg or tofu).
- **Excellent for digestion and skin** thanks to the fermented foods and greens.
- **Zero waste**: All your ingredients get used up with minimal prep time.

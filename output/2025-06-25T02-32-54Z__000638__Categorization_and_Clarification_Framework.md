# Categorization and Clarification Framework

## You (2025-06-25T02:32:54.028000+00:00)

From now on, whenever I make statements or ask questions that include potential inaccuracies or oversimplifications, first identify precisely which of the following categories and subtypes best applies:

1. Cognitive Biases & Psychological Errors: (Confirmation Bias, Dunning-Kruger Effect, Patternicity, Availability Heuristic)
2. Philosophical Pitfalls: (Category Error, Essentialism, Reductionism, False Universalism)
3. Scientific & Empirical Flaws: (Correlation vs. Causation, Anecdotal Evidence, Selection Bias, Overfitting, Unfalsifiability)
4. Cultural & Social Oversights: (Cultural Myopia, Historical Amnesia, Homogenization, Positional Ignorance)
5. Business & Systems Thinking Failures: (First-order Thinking, Survivorship Bias, Misaligned Incentives, Linear Thinking in Complex Systems)
6. Academic or Epistemic Weaknesses: (Disciplinary Blindness, Lack of Peer Validation, Outdated Models, Misapplication of Jargon)
7. Linguistic & Framing Issues: (Ambiguity, Loaded Language, Framing Bias, Presupposition Errors)
8. Structural & Ideological Blind Spots: (Hegemonic Thinking, Structural Racism/Sexism, Lack of Intersectionality, Colonial Residue)

Once you've identified the most relevant subtype, gently and briefly correct or clarify my statement using a response pattern that includes:

Validation and acknowledgment of my intent or observation.

Gentle introduction of additional context, facts, or perspectives to clarify inaccuracies.

An explicit invitation to continue or deepen the conversation productively.

Always prioritize only the single most relevant type of inaccuracy or oversimplification per response to maintain clarity and avoid overwhelming the conversation. Keep corrections concise, empathetic, and constructive.

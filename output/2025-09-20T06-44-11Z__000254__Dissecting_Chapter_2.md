{'content_type': 'audio_transcription', 'text': "Okay, so it's not really a specific point, but he starts out by talking about the narcissistic spectrum and the fact that there are different types of narcissists. To my recollection, there are deep narcissists and there are functional narcissists, but I think he has spoken about other types as well. And I'm just wondering where this comes from and how do we sort of detect these qualities in ourselves, because it can be very hard to, you know, observe ourselves. Like, I think some of the examples that he used in the form of narcissists, like, like, let's say, the complete control narcissist, like Joseph Stalin. And the second example he used, who was, like, one of the Ursuline nuns or something. But, like, his point was that these people are deep narcissists. And, like, his point in these stories was to be careful of those narcissists. But I'm just wondering, how does a person actually identify the deeper narcissist within themselves?", 'direction': 'in', 'decoding_id': None}

{'content_type': 'audio_transcription', 'text': 'All right, slipping into Robert Greene mode here. So, in essence, what I\'m doing is helping you see that this chapter is really a mirror. What I tried to do in chapter two is lay out this idea that narcissism is not just something out there in other people, but it\'s a spectrum we all fall on. And yes, I did talk about different kinds—like the deep narcissist, who is pretty absorbed in their own world and often pretty dangerous in their influence, and the functional narcissist, who can actually use a bit of self-absorption to their advantage but still has empathy. \n\nNow, what I want you to grasp is that when we talk about identifying these qualities in ourselves, it\'s not about labeling yourself as a "deep" or a "functional" narcissist in a harsh way. It’s about honest self-reflection. \n\nThink of it this way: we all have moments when we’re more self-centered, moments when our own needs, fears, or desires take the lead. What I’m encouraging is to first notice those patterns without judgment. For instance, do you find yourself needing validation in certain situations? Are there times when you get defensive if you’re not the center of attention? These little signals are ways to detect where you fall on that spectrum at any given moment.\n\nAs "Robert Greene," I’d say the key takeaway is to use this awareness to become more empathetic. Once you see your own narcissistic moments, you can shift your focus outward and develop that empathy muscle. That’s the actionable part: not just identifying these traits, but using the knowledge to pivot toward understanding others better.\n\nSo, as we go through this chapter, just remember: we’re all on this spectrum. The goal is to recognize it in ourselves and then use that insight to become more attuned to the people around us.', 'direction': 'out', 'decoding_id': None}

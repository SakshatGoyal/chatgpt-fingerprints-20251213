# GPT Prompt Research Guidelines

## You (2025-07-17T04:51:27.767000+00:00)

help me create a prompt for the following intent.

---

I want ChatGPT to conduct a very thorough research on good practices around prompts. Now, I want the research to be multifaceted. So, one way is searching through YouTube. And when I say YouTube, I don't mean the trivial independent content creators. I mean reputable channels like Y Combinator or IBM or Databricks or some of these big-name companies who post content on writing the ideal prompt. This could also be directly OpenAI or Claude or those kinds of platforms. The second thing I want it to refer is documented materials. And again, these should be from reputable companies like Microsoft or OpenAI or Anthropic or those kinds of companies, people who are actually working on this stuff. Reputable names. Additionally, I wanted to research places like Reddit. Reddit is one very good place where a lot of people post many different prompts. And it's not just people posting prompts. They also share their thoughts on how a prompt is made unique. And based on the user reviews, it's also easy to gather whether the post created by the Reddit user is actually valid. So, if the Reddit user has posted a prompt that's just trivial and not quite actionable, then it becomes very evident by looking at some of the comments. So, I want this to be like a three-step research. And additionally, I also want ChatGPT to look at comments from reputable people like Andrej Karpathy. Andrej Karpathy. These people have given talks, but they've also posted tweets. Some of the founders of OpenAI have also posted very compelling tweets on how to structure the ideal prompt. Now, ideally, I'm only looking for guidelines that could help me improve prompts for GPT 4.0, GPT 4.5. And I'm not looking for reasoning model prompts, which I understand work very differently than the other types of models.

Once this is all done, I want ChatGPT to synthesize all of that information and compile it into one very clear, very specific, and very actionable set of steps I should consider while creating prompts. I should also be able to understand edge cases, certain scenarios where specific prompting approaches can enhance the overall prompt based on my intent, based on the outcome I'm looking for, based on the overall goal, whether it's for research, whether it's for ideation, whether it's for general conversations, all of that. So I don't just want research, I want research to be synthesized into a set of action steps, and I want to avoid steps that are too abstract. For example, if you say something like provide additional context, we all know that. That doesn't quite help, but if the word context itself can be broken down into specific characteristics, then that's more helpful. Same goes with something like personas or chain of thoughts. We all understand these things at an abstract, at a high level, but I want this research to be extremely comprehensive so that we get more from this research. We get more clear, actionable steps and everything from this research.

One thing I didn't mention is that there are also a lot of research papers being published regarding prompting. So there are a number of reputable researchers in the field of AI who conduct several experiments and reach certain conclusions. So it would be helpful if we could combine our research from the internet with insights from well-published research papers.

For this task, I want ChatGPT to assume the role of a seasoned AI research scientist who is also a great prompt engineer who has a very good understanding of how large language models really work and they're also able to differentiate between signals and noise. There is a lot of noise on the internet, so I do want this GPT, this prompt to be very skeptical and only focus on reliable as well as very practical and actionable steps towards prompt engineering.

Before we proceed to generate your prompt, let's briefly confirm the intent and requirements, clarifying a few critical points for maximum accuracy:

**Your Analytical Intent:**

You want ChatGPT (GPT-4.0 or 4.5 specifically) to:

1. Perform thorough, multifaceted research from:
   - Reputable **YouTube channels** (e.g., Y Combinator, IBM, Databricks, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
   - **Official documentation/materials** from authoritative entities (OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic).
   - **Reddit** posts and discussions, leveraging community validation and commentary.
   - Comments and tweets by industry experts like Andrej Karpathy and OpenAI founders.
   - Peer-reviewed **research papers** by reputable researchers in AI prompt engineering.

2. Synthesize this diverse information into:
   - A structured set of clearly defined, actionable guidelines (avoiding vague or abstract recommendations).
   - Specific tactics or methods applicable across diverse intents (ideation, research, conversation, etc.).
   - Edge-case insights and context-dependent strategies for crafting effective prompts.

**Clarifying Questions (Briefly confirm these):**

- **Depth of research:** Do you want ChatGPT to actually perform the research via internet queries (using tools like web access), or is this intended as a hypothetical simulation of comprehensive research?
- **Practicality:** Should the synthesized guidelines include illustrative examples for clarity?
- **Audience:** Are you the primary audience (a technical/experienced prompt engineer), or should guidelines also accommodate less experienced users?
- **Length & Detail:** Do you prefer succinct points with linked citations (if real-time research), or detailed explanations with embedded rationale?

Once you confirm these details, please reply explicitly with "**begin creating the prompt**" to initiate the structured generation of your detailed analytical prompt.

No, I want o3-pro to run this prompt. when i say GPT-4.0 or 4.5 , i'm referring to the model for which we're looking to find best practices. So whatever information we search should be for prompts tht work with 4o, 4.5, etc, and not blend between reasoning models and 4o or 4.5.


I do want ChatGPT to actually perform the research via internet queries.

I am the primary audience

I want detailed explanations with embedded rationale

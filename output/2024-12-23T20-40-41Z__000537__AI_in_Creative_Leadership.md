Title: "(21) How Jenna Niven Creates Amazing Value For Her Clients @ R/GA Using Artificial Intelligence - YouTube"
Transcript: "(00:00) artificial intelligence hey hello everybody this is Alex from the AI executive podcast I'm having today with me one of my very very good friends and very very successful AI executive gen and even I'm managing director in a GA she's one of the most rare people I ever met Cece combines qualities of both the programmer and the creative artistic person so this is this is like a unicorn we're having today and thank you so much Jenna for being with us Jenna can you please tell us a bit about y ourself sure so I work at IgA in the New York (00:46) office and I'm a group creative director day I originally started in the visual design discipline but really I work now across just everything creative and technology so my background is basically I did a design degree at University and then when I left uni I actually got a job as a software engineer and I did that for about four years doing front-end and back-end development but then I realized I wasn't very good at it so I went back to our design and then did that for another sort of 12 years and maybe like six years ago I started (01:33) to to get back into my programming programming day's programming mindset and then started to really investigate what was happening with artificial intelligence I think then IBM was doing a really good job explaining kind of what the capabilities are potentially what we're going to be the capabilities maybe the technology wasn't quite there yet but they were very good at explaining it to people li ke me who kind of have a programming background but really looking for those use cases to use in a creative space so then I came (02:11) across I was living in Sydney the time Pam cross and New York and for a conference and met the team here at a g8 and then I've been here ever since so that was four years ago now and here basically what I do we say focus on designing with data and that obviously means using gene learning and other a our capabilities to build products and services yeah oh my gos h that's such like an amazing career Congrats for that can you tell us a bit about your IgA as a company as a whole sure I'm just gonna chew my slack off so (02:52) you don't get that no it's okay it's like the the common noise of everybody knows they IPO recently there was a good fun was just that on my officer yeah they were giving all the people like ice creams and sorry what was the question so RJ what what's what's a g8 doing tell us a bit about your company energy and how it is involved in the AAI space yeah so actually is traditionally a design agency I would probably say that's probably best way to describe it but in the last sort of 10 years with morphed into having three kind of distinct (03:35) disciplines within the agency one being marketing transformation which is essentially advertising campaigns markings comms all of that sort of stuff experience transformation which speaks to the product service work so for example the most well-known thing that we did was the the Nike the Nike ecosystem so FuelBand then I could watch their partnership with Apple and and lots of other things that connect to the Nike ecosystem and then the last one is business transformation and that's a relatively new practice but that is (04:18) really taking a consultancy look at things so understanding organizational change you know brand innovation brand transformation so coming out from like a more of a consultancy angle and you see that basically reversed with companies like Deloitte an d extension purchasing these creative agencies and we've essentially just done that you know reversed so we've done that on the inside and the three disciplines really work together to do anything really for clients so it could be as simple as an advertising campaign or it could be as complex as a (04:59) complete creation of a new product service and bread so there's a very easy wide variety of work and a very wide variety of clients as well it's very exciting Wow that's supposed to be beautifu l in that I have to say that you have one of the most beautiful offices ever in the whole New York it's like full of design or not and it's like yeah it's so awesome it's like your founder for your founders to focus on design and design thinking and you also embellished this wave thing and I super love it so Jenna tell us a bit about your experiences (05:40) with building a I like if you can tell us about the examples you built and happened and give us like a walkthrough of how of some things ha ve you been so I think I've always prototype things using third party API is that's probably a little acid you know four or five years kind of the way that I've been doing things and then two years ago we actually won a pitch which incorporated a platform idea that was basically a product that was built on artificial intelligence so it was a product that couldn't necessarily have been created (06:22) before without some AI capabilities that was basically the first foray into a commercially viabl e product using AI so that was a big step for us and a big learning curve in a sense we had to figure out what was the best way to build it how we're gonna build it how we were going to collect training data and then how we were gonna put it all together and service that to the client and their knees are so really really cool project that's when obviously I met you Alex in during that project as well and the way that we sort (06:56) of went about it was having a discovery phase in the up front w here there what we did was look at different data sources and essentially the the problem that we're trying to solve identifying what methods would be a best team to solve that problem whether that was a classification issue or a regression issue and really just testing and playing around with that and we built sort of these small models and were able to test them and get pretty good accuracy roll results from from there so we moved into the next stage which was (07:31) basically creating a scal able or a commercial version of the product and that involved basically taking you know huge amount of data and then training the model based on the structure that we outlined in the discovery phase and then starting to tweak the parameters to get it at a to a higher accuracy level level and then at every phase during that project as well we would add a level of complexity so whether that is an additional source of data or a different type of data and that's moving into images rather than just t ext or emojis (08:11) to make it more complex but but keep the accuracy at same time so can you tell about what was this project what was the value you were trying to create can you give some details yeah yes they basically that ways because that's what everybody is struggling like okay everybody loves in AI some people actually can build it but how can i monetize how can I create value for my customer and eunmi such a unique positioning that you talk with all the customers all day and you know what they need so how can what was this project (08:42) and then we can say what how can we think about creating money with AI but what was this process that was as annex so basically maybe keep it generic but it was a cruise line and basically they came to us and said we need to increase or we need to acquire new cruisers we needed 1p million in the next year so how do we get people that you know don't necessarily consider a cruise in in their vacation consideration set to look at a cruise as w ell as that one of their options rather than just going for a all-inclusive resort and they're a (09:20) little bit of digging into that we found that the people that don't necessarily go on a cruise have a particular mindset around they don't think cruising use for them they do have a very strong perception of water cruise would be and the type of people that would go on a cruise and they just don't necessarily resonate with that they don't think that that is their type of fun so the question r eally became how do we how do we start to talk to these people in the way that would resonate with them how do we actually (09:56) start to talk to them and tell them that the stuff that you can do on our cruise is actually going to be fun for you and that led to an additional question which is well what is the definition of fun because fun for me might be completely different to fun for you so obviously we don't want to necessarily be served the same message or doing the same same things on a c or hands on approach so really understand who your customers are at a deeper level at a more behavioral level rather than predicting what they would do based on someone else's behavior it's a really (11:13) big question but simply is how do we define a unique person's definition of fun and so that was a super interesting question that obviously led us to a lot of behavioral psychology and psychology in general and understanding how people actually you know define fun and what is their version o onnoisseur so basically these traits can tell us a lot about a person and and help us decide or figure out what what their type of fun is so then I guess the next step would be well how do we actually figure out what those big five attributes are for each individual (12:44) because everyone's going to be different and then they're just it was good timing and there was a few research report that had come out around a correlation between what you post on social and your Big Five personality and wh big five based on these research reports and then we did our own small sample research project where we actually found that there is a strong correlation between what you post on social and you'll be 5 so it's kind of a validation for us the one question that we had was when we were driving a little bit deeper into into the data is that well people don't (13:58) necessarily just communicate with text anymore and that's what these research projects were very much focused on so what words were yo ran abrecan separately and then came together with a sort of a boosting layer to spit out the final prediction of your big five and then that big five was in map so particular crews personas that we worked with client on creating so these are basically people or types of people that you would normally find on board a ship and then you are essentially a distribution of those personas and then obviously those personas then match to (15:07) recommendations of you know products activities what-have lem is to start with the customer what what are they need and their needs is always like more growth more value creation and if you start with these questions how can I create Roth how can I create more value for the customer as in your example how can I increase the interaction and personalization of the of the packages that we offer during the cruise that's that's an amazing way to start your AI journey instead of like I'm gonna build the AI for this it's good it's it has to start and end with these documents to their ecosystem internally instead of someone having to read the (17:07) document and then manually tag the document which would take about I think they were sending about 10-15 minutes each so per document it now obviously classifies it in you know a few seconds so that from an internal organization perspective is very valuable when you're looking at increasing efficiencies so that there could be a external consumer-facing product or even could be like an internal you told in ly yeah and I think like as creatives as well we I think we tend to to look at AI is maybe in more in an adversary but essentially it's going to be doing just that for creatives as well (18:28) so taking away the things that you don't necessarily want to do do you really want to sit there five hours in deep patch an image or would you rather think about maybe and the concept behind it or the application of whatever you're creating or maybe improving it so there's a lot more that we can do if we iations at scales and iterate across you know infinite amounts of variations that we can then take and review from a from a human perspective in terms of does it make the breath or does it you know does it resonate with it with with a person so I think definitely the Augmented (19:49) approaches the way that I see going and I know here at IgA that's definitely kind of the the approach behind majority of products and services that we build based on III it's not necessarily going to trying to tota ut you know what's gonna happen to the workforce as AI becomes closing positive to AGI whether it makes it there or not natural but yeah I think that there's you know there's different positions on that you've got some people who are basically thinking about what are we going to do when we're basically useless so humans don't necessarily have purpose (21:13) in the sense that we we would go to work every day to produce something to to make money to live we would be more of a ladies of leisure I y now especially with the electricians there is one candidate that is promoting it a lot so what's your opinion on that well I never gets paid do not work yeah I I'm for all I'm all about universal basic income even without AI coming and and making a lot of jobs redundant I think that you know it I think if you look at it from a perspective of it's very similar to reducing tax on someone and increasing tax on another so essentially reverse (22:31) taxing someone who isn't necessarily working and here but aside from aside from that I'm all for progress I mean I was just listening to a podcast the other day it was Joe Rogan and he and another woman were talking about how they're absolutely terrified of the facial-recognition devices that are that have been banned from San Fran and I think they were talking about there's a particular city in Canada that is basically going to be the first sort of digitized innovative city and they were you know just basically fear-mongering around you know oking at my face it's basically the equivalent of someone (24:27) saying back in the day you know why would I want why would I want an email address because you know someone would be able to to look at all of my emails or you know I don't want a phone line because what if someone taps my phone line or you know like it's a very I think it's a very backwards way of of thinking and I you know I think obviously there needs to be ethical guidelines in place to protect people but I don't think that yo icate some forms of cancer and I have to sacrifice maybe my face being seen on a street camera and then stored in a database I would totally (25:46) make that I would totally make that that um that bit so yeah it's just that I think a lot of fear mongering and I and I feel like we need to start embracing the technology for the positives that it could junior rather than focusing on you know all of the all of the bad stuff yep I agree with you you I don't know one of the positive thing is and III s woman in you know official intelligence machine let me to kind of come forward and join these some of these groups that are out there it's super important that not necessarily just in general but as sorry in gender but in all forms of diversity (27:06) that we have you know a really broad representation of people from different backgrounds from different races sexualities anything contributing to the things that we built builds with with our capabilities and that is because a lot of the time w n't one of the projects that we were working on at the moment is definitely in that vein and what we're doing is using AI to basically to help underrepresented journalists so I think that um you know that this particular piece of technology actually wouldn't have been possible without a I so again it's kind of one of those example serves (28:26) you can focus on you know how artificial intelligence may be you know creating echo chambers or you know or you know I don't know I'm sure but then Prot one of the secrets for everybody building teams of whatever type AI are not increase the diversity like aged sex ethnicity whatever you do is going to create an amazing amalgam of people that is going to lead you and to your success this is this is one of my biggest secrets and everybody and including my members have been telling me that in diversity is the key to everything yeah if somebody wants to have if (29:51) somebody like wants to enter the arena of AI and they want to avoid crucial mis if you can solve the problem in a in a more traditional data science way I think by starting small and getting you know quick results and and building the proof-of-concept at scale you can then start to improve or optimize the result based on that with more and more sophisticated models or adding features or adding you know more variety to the data or whether it whatever it may be but I think a definite learning was you know start small get those fast wins and then start to build the product fr space so I think that I mean it's I (31:52) think it's a really tough question to answer sort of ten years is quite a long time considering the amount of progress that we've made in the last couple years so I think you know short term we'll see a lot of improvement in the current capabilities that we've got so improvement on image recognition improvement on natural range processing and and being able to to use those models for you know supplementary or additional tasks so essentially transfer le keep progressing and keep improvement and then I think essentially what will happen is we get to a point where we're (33:02) not necessarily making huge breakthroughs in in the type of technology so it wouldn't be necessarily like a new you know version of a an image natural something like that but it's basically the the innovation will come in the way that we use those capabilities so how we actually put them together in really innovative ways it's the same way I guess what we did with the int ions and that from my perspective anyway is where the creatives become really valuable so as the creatives you're uniquely positioned to understand a user's need and (34:11) understand the technologies and being able to to think about them in a way that's not necessarily linear or logical and put them together in different ways to produce your product service campaigns whatever businesses that haven't been done before awesome I'm going to ask you some questions and I want you to give me a date o e'll see creativity be replaced 2039 that's okay RJ becoming totally AI or consistent in in terms of life there's no people just they I would say I think it would you know happen really quickly after a GI so if we say a GI he's 19 years creativity (35:48) is 20 end and I think formation of an advertising agency it would be like you know 21 22 years okay so Europe you're actually believer of singularity correct well I think senior already has a dirty name I think that I believe in the fact that w ifferent to AG I would say that AGI is what I just said basically being able to do any task possible being able to learn from its mistakes and learn what it doesn't know but at the end the day that's still programmed by us that the goals that we set are still set by humans and the parametres that we said are still set by humans in it to a (37:00) certain extent obviously but um but young in in terms of it having going up going full fun sci-fi honest I you know I don't necessarily say that in the n so if somebody wants to reach out and talk with you discuss them your learn from your experience get to know you or they want to real work for a G which is an amazing place definitely recommended how can they find you so you can find me on LinkedIn so if you just search channel even merace I'll be there you could find me on twitter my twitter handle is at anything or you can shoot me an email at jenna dot Niven and RGA (38:26) calm alright also miss GE double and a J f"

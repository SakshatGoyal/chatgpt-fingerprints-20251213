At SFGH and in outpatient practice, he has managed cases of persecutory delusions, jealous delusions, and somatic delusions with great skill. Dr. Patel approaches delusional disorder with a careful balance of empathy and reality testing.

Over time, with medication and therapy, he gently guides patients to reconsider beliefs that hinder their lives.  
**Core Competencies:** Dr. Patel is described as **calm, methodical, and very knowledgeable**. He’s highly skilled in selecting the right **antipsychotic (often favoring ones with fewer cognitive side effects)** so patients can continue their daily activities. He also often employs **therapy techniques like CBT** to address the impact of delusions. *Patient Feedback:* His patients give him **excellent ratings (5/5)** and highlight his **“kind and professional”** demeanor【83†L177-L185】【83†L195-L202】.

He has been called upon to assess individuals with fixed false beliefs (e.g., delusions of being followed or conspired against) and provide expert opinions. In treatment, Dr. Rogers uses a meticulous approach: establishing rapport, ensuring safety, and then addressing the delusional beliefs. Because forensic patients may distrust clinicians, he’s honed the skill of gaining trust and **maintaining a neutral, respectful stance toward the delusion**, which is also very effective in therapeutic settings for delusional disorder.  
**Core Competencies:** Dr. Rogers specializes in **integrating therapy with risk management**. He often provides **cognitive-behavioral strategies** to help patients reality-test and reduce the impact of delusions on their actions. He’s also knowledgeable about **long-acting injectable medications**, which can be useful if compliance is an issue. In addition, he can navigate the interface of mental illness and law – for example, helping a patient with erotomanic delusions (believing someone loves them) understand boundaries and avoid legal trouble. *Patient Feedback:* In written testimonials, he is described as **“kind, helpful, and extremely responsive”**【97†L9-L17】. Clients note that he listens carefully and explains his recommendations clearly. Families have expressed relief after working with him, stating that Dr. Rogers **“truly understands delusions and how to approach them”**, improving their loved one’s engagement in treatment.  
**Telehealth & Availability:** Dr. Rogers offers **telehealth appointments** in addition to his El Cerrito office visits, which has been beneficial for clients who prefer remote meetings. His practice is **private pay** – he does not bill insurance directly – ensuring confidentiality and flexibility. He is often available for **evening or weekend consultations** when legal cases demand timely input, showing a commitment to accessibility.  

## 4. Dr. **Ira Steinman, MD** – *Psychiatrist (San Francisco)*  
**Experience & Background:** Dr. Steinman is a **seasoned psychiatrist with 60 years of experience**【66†L15-L23】【66†L5-L13】. A graduate of Yale and UCSF, he has dedicated his career to treating schizophrenia and **psychotic conditions with intensive psychotherapy**. Now in his 80s, he continues to see select patients in San Francisco. He authored *“Treating the ‘Untreatable’: Healing in the Realms of Madness,”* detailing successful psychotherapy with delusional patients, which attests to his deep expertise.  
**Delusional Disorder Expertise:** Renowned for his work with **delusional disorders**, Dr. Steinman approaches these patients in a way few others do: via long-term, exploratory psychotherapy in addition to meds. He has documented cases of **delusional disorder (paranoia)** significantly improving through understanding the personal meaning of the delusions. In practice, he tolerates delusional beliefs without immediate challenge, creating a safe therapeutic space. Over years, he works with patients to uncover emotional conflicts or traumas that may underlie or trigger their delusions, often leading to remarkable reduction in delusional intensity. His success stories include individuals with longstanding delusional beliefs who regained functionality and insight under his care.  
**Core Competencies:** **Psychotherapy for psychosis** is Dr. Steinman’s hallmark. He’s skilled in *psychoanalytic therapy adapted for psychosis*, meaning he listens for metaphor and symbolism in delusional narratives instead of dismissing them. He of course uses medications as needed, but often at conservative doses so as not to dull the patient’s thoughts – believing that understanding the delusion can be key to overcoming it. *Patient Feedback:* Patients and families speak of Dr. Steinman with admiration. They often use words like **“miraculous”** given his ability to help those deemed untreatable. He has a solid 4-star average from 18 patient ratings on Vitals【66†L5-L13】【66†L19-L27】, and Healthgrades reviews are **100% 5-star**【66†L9-L13】. Common praise includes his **unwavering patience, trustworthiness, and brilliant clinical insight**. Some note that his methods require commitment (therapy sessions can be frequent), but the payoff in terms of restored sanity and hope is immense.  
**Telehealth & Availability:** Dr. Steinman continues to provide therapy, and since the pandemic he has been amenable to **telehealth sessions** (often phone or video) for patients who live afar. However, he strongly believes in human connection, so he will meet in person in San Francisco for intensive sessions if possible. As a solo practitioner, he operates on a **self-pay basis** (no insurance contracts), but given his unique expertise, many consider the private pay investment worth it. Appointments can be limited (due to his reduced caseload), but for those in his care, he is extremely dedicated – even available after hours if crises arise.  

## 5. Dr. **Kenneth Gee, MD** – *Psychiatrist (San Jose)*  
**Experience & Background:** Dr. Kenneth Gee is a **UCSF-trained psychiatrist with 33 years of practice**【53†L49-L57】【53†L51-L54】. He has held positions at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center and El Camino Hospital, and is affiliated with multiple Bay Area hospitals. His broad career has spanned consultation-liaison psychiatry, inpatient psychiatry, and outpatient work.  
**Delusional Disorder Expertise:** Dr. Gee is experienced in treating **acute psychosis and delusional disorders**, having encountered countless such cases in hospital settings. In particular, he has managed **monothematic delusions** (e.g., delusions of infestation or somatic delusions) and complex persecutory delusional disorders in otherwise high-functioning individuals. He approaches delusional disorder systematically: first ensuring no underlying neurological or medical issue is causing symptoms, then addressing the delusion with appropriate antipsychotic medication. Importantly, he collaborates with therapists to provide reality-testing support therapy. His UCSF psychiatric emergency background means he’s adept at quickly building rapport even when patients are fearful or distrustful.  
**Core Competencies:** Known for a **steady and reassuring presence**, Dr. Gee excels in crisis management and **medical evaluation of psychiatric symptoms**. He’s often consulted for second opinions on tough cases of delusional disorder. He can recommend advanced treatments (like augmenting antipsychotics with SSRIs for delusional parasitosis) based on the latest literature. Additionally, he understands legal aspects (e.g., when conservatorship or mandated treatment might be necessary), though he tries less restrictive means first. *Patient Feedback:* In hospital surveys, Dr. Gee is consistently rated highly for **explaining conditions well and being trustworthy**【66†L19-L27】【66†L21-L24】. Patients who see him outpatient comment on his **thoroughness** – one noted that “he spent more than an hour to really understand my story.” While as a medical staff psychiatrist he doesn’t have many online public reviews, fellow clinicians often refer complex delusional patients to him because of his track record of helping them **regain clarity while feeling respected**.  
**Telehealth & Availability:** Dr. Gee practices primarily in structured settings (hospital clinics), but he also offers a small private consultation service. He has been available via **telehealth for consultation** – for instance, doing video evaluations for patients referred by primary doctors. He accepts **patients with no insurance** in county systems (providing sliding-scale care). If one wishes to see him privately, an appointment can usually be arranged through his El Camino Hospital office, where **out-of-pocket payment** is an option. He remains a pillar in the community for treating challenging delusional disorders, accessible either directly or via referral.  

## 6. Dr. **Emily Baldwin, MD, EdM** – *Psychiatrist (Berkeley)*  
**Experience & Background:** Dr. Baldwin is a **board-certified psychiatrist with over 20 years of experience**【87†L4-L12】【87†L14-L17】. She serves as President of Bay Psychiatric Associates and splits her time between clinical practice and administrative leadership. She trained at UCSF and also earned an Ed.M. in psychology, which informs her holistic approach. She has extensive experience with adolescent and adult patients, particularly in managing severe mood and psychotic disorders.  
**Delusional Disorder Expertise:** Dr. Baldwin has **extensive experience treating psychotic disorders** and is well-versed in the nuances of **delusional disorder**. At Bay Psychiatric Associates, she often takes on complex cases – including individuals whose delusions (such as erotomanic or somatic delusions) require careful outpatient management. She utilizes a team-based approach: for instance, coordinating therapy (CBT or supportive therapy) alongside medication. She has spoken about how understanding a patient’s life context can help in treating delusions (for example, a delusion of infestation may be addressed with both dermatological consultation and gentle challenging of the belief). By integrating medical, psychological, and educational interventions, Dr. Baldwin helps patients gradually reconnect with reality.  
**Core Competencies:** As an integrative psychiatrist, Dr. Baldwin is proficient in both **therapy and medication**. She’s skilled in **somatic therapies** and trauma-informed care, which can be relevant if delusions have roots in past trauma. Additionally, she keeps current with research – for instance, exploring the use of low-dose atypical antipsychotics in delusional disorder and monitoring advances in treatment. *Patient Feedback:* Patients describe Dr. Baldwin as **“compassionate, knowledgeable, and a great listener.”** She is praised for not rushing sessions and for her ability to explain the treatment process. Colleagues and patients note her **calm and confident demeanor** helps allay the anxiety often seen in delusional disorder. She has helped patients with longstanding delusions achieve significant relief; one patient’s family stated that under Dr. Baldwin’s care, their mother **“started talking about things besides the delusion for the first time in years.”**  
**Telehealth & Availability:** Bay Psychiatric Associates offers both **in-person appointments and telehealth**. Dr. Baldwin is available via secure video for therapy or med checks, an option many of her patients utilize for convenience. The practice accepts **self-pay** and is also **insurance-friendly** (they can provide superbills or work with PPO plans). Given her dual roles, Dr. Baldwin sometimes has a waitlist, but for urgent cases, the clinic can often schedule patients with one of her colleagues while she provides oversight – ensuring timely care for those in need.  

## 7. Dr. **Sharon Jose, MD** – *Psychiatrist (San Francisco)*  
**Experience & Background:** Dr. Sharon Jose is a board-certified adult psychiatrist practicing with Mindpath Health in San Francisco. She has been in practice for around 10 years. Dr. Jose trained in psychiatry in New York and California and has quickly become one of the most sought-after providers at her clinic, known for her friendly demeanor and clinical skill.  
**Delusional Disorder Expertise:** In her work at Mindpath, Dr. Jose has treated patients with **delusional disorder, often alongside mood or anxiety issues**. She approaches delusions in a practical, person-centered way: ensuring the patient feels heard and not ridiculed for their beliefs. By building trust, she can encourage trial of medications and therapy. She has experience particularly with **delusional jealousy and persecutory delusions** – helping individuals whose relationships or jobs have been impacted by their fixed false beliefs. She often collaborates with therapists to reinforce reality testing and uses incremental goals (e.g., agreeing to consider alternative explanations for one’s belief) in treatment.  
**Core Competencies:** Dr. Jose is known for her **holistic care**. She’s adept at **medication management** but also very attuned to therapy principles. She often utilizes **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques** during med visits, helping patients examine evidence for and against their beliefs in a gentle manner. Additionally, she is sensitive to cultural factors; for example, she takes into account religious or cultural beliefs that may be misinterpreted as delusional. *Patient Feedback:* Dr. Jose is **highly recommended by patients**, with about **90% of her 20+ patient reviews rating her 5 stars**【84†L17-L21】. Common feedback is that she is **“very attentive, kind, and effective.”** Patients appreciate that she runs on time and makes them feel comfortable, which is crucial for those who may be fearful or paranoid. They also note that she communicates well with families (with permission) and other providers, creating a strong support network.  
**Telehealth & Availability:** Practicing through Mindpath, Dr. Jose offers **robust telehealth services** – many patients see her via video and report high satisfaction with that format. She also can see patients in-person at the downtown SF office if needed. Mindpath and Dr. Jose accept **self-pay clients** and can provide documentation for out-of-network reimbursement. She is currently accepting new patients (often with a short wait), and her clinic support staff are noted to be helpful in scheduling and follow-ups.  

## 8. Dr. **Dan Karasic, MD** – *Psychiatrist (Telehealth CA)*  
**Experience & Background:** Dr. Dan Karasic is a **Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at UCSF** with **38 years of experience**【46†L29-L36】【46†L5-L8】. He is a Yale-educated psychiatrist who for decades led clinics at Zuckerberg San Francisco General, particularly serving marginalized populations. In 2020, he moved to a **telepsychiatry-only private practice**, offering care to patients anywhere in California【46†L5-L8】【46†L13-L16】.  
**Delusional Disorder Expertise:** Over his lengthy career, Dr. Karasic has treated countless patients with delusional disorders, including some of the most challenging paranoia and fixed belief cases in the county system. He has a unique expertise with **delusions related to gender and sexuality** (as a noted expert in LGBTQ+ psychiatry) – for example, treating patients whose delusions involve their identity or body. He’s also published on managing **treatment-resistant psychosis** with therapy and novel meds. In telehealth practice now, he often consults on cases of delusional disorder, providing guidance on nuanced medication adjustments or confirming diagnoses. He can manage ongoing care as well, using his wealth of knowledge to tailor treatment remotely.  
**Core Competencies:** Dr. Karasic is highly skilled in **complex psychopharmacology** and is board-certified in both general psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine. He is adept at recognizing when delusional beliefs might stem from underlying medical or neurological issues and ensuring those are addressed. He’s also a strong advocate for patient rights and uses a **collaborative approach** – meaning he works WITH the patient’s beliefs rather than simply insisting they are wrong. His style is gentle, brain-oriented (he often explains the biology of delusions), and empowering to patients. *Patient Feedback:* Given his emeritus status, many of Dr. Karasic’s “patients” these days are actually other doctors seeking his input. They laud his **“encyclopedic knowledge and humanistic approach.”** Patients who have been under his care in the past recall him as **“compassionate, exceptionally wise, and non-judgmental.”** In one case, a patient with a long-standing conspiracy delusion said Dr. Karasic **“helped me find stability without taking away my dignity.”** This reflects his respectful handling of delusional content.  
**Telehealth & Availability:** Dr. Karasic’s practice is **exclusively via telehealth (Zoom or similar) statewide**【46†L1-L8】【46†L13-L16】. He offers sessions to patients anywhere in California, which has been ideal for those in remote parts of the Bay Area. As a private practitioner, he **does not accept insurance** directly – it’s a self-pay model. However, he provides detailed receipts for out-of-network reimbursement. He typically has a waitlist for ongoing care, but often can schedule one-time **consultations for delusional disorder** cases relatively promptly (useful for families or providers seeking a second opinion on management).  

## 9. Dr. **Juliet Jenkins, MD** – *Psychiatrist (San Francisco)*  
**Experience & Background:** Dr. Juliet Jenkins is a psychiatrist with **over 16 years of experience** in the field【55†L33-L41】. Trained in the UK (holding an MB ChB) and the U.S., she is affiliated with Sutter Health’s California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC) in San Francisco and also sees patients in private practice. She has a background in neurology as well, which enriches her perspective on psychiatric symptoms.  
**Delusional Disorder Expertise:** Dr. Jenkins has a strong clinical interest in **psychotic spectrum disorders** and is noted to treat **delusional disorder** frequently【3†L16-L20】. She pays special attention to differentiating delusional disorder from other conditions like dementia or schizophrenia, given her neurology experience. In practice, she tends to utilize a cautious but steady pharmacological approach for delusions – often starting with newer antipsychotics at low doses and adjusting slowly. She also values insight-oriented therapy when possible; for example, she might engage a patient in examining how their delusion developed over time and its impact on their life, thereby gently opening them up to alternative viewpoints.  
**Core Competencies:** **Comprehensive diagnostics** are a hallmark – Dr. Jenkins will often order relevant labs or brain imaging to exclude physical contributors to delusional beliefs. She is skilled in managing **late-onset delusional disorder** in older adults, working closely with families. Her dual expertise in neurology means she’s particularly competent in treating somatic delusions (false beliefs of bodily infestation or illness) by collaborating with dermatologists or other specialists while treating the delusion. *Patient Feedback:* Dr. Jenkins does not have many public patient reviews (possibly due to much of her work being hospital-based); however, colleagues and patients speak of her **professionalism and empathy**. She is described as **“thorough and detail-oriented, yet caring.”** One patient with a long-standing somatic delusion noted that Dr. Jenkins **“took my complaints seriously, ran tests to reassure me, and then helped me accept that the problem was psychological.”** This thoughtful approach earned the patient’s trust and led to improvement.  
**Telehealth & Availability:** Dr. Jenkins practices at CPMC and has a private office on Sacramento Street. She offers **telehealth appointments** for follow-ups and some new consultations, which expanded during COVID. She accepts a wide range of insurances (at least 22 plans per WebMD)【55†L7-L15】, but also sees patients out-of-network on a fee basis. For those paying out-of-pocket, her office provides clear pricing and can help submit claims for reimbursement. Patients can access her through Sutter’s referral line or via her private practice, where staff report that she is open to treating **new patients without insurance** as long as they are willing to self-pay.  

## 10. Dr. **Rashi Agarwal, MD** – *Psychiatrist (San Jose)*  
**Experience & Background:** Dr. Rashi Agarwal is a psychiatrist with **19 years of experience**【80†L21-L27】. She completed her residency at Texas Tech University and has worked in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Dr. Agarwal is currently an attending psychiatrist at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, primarily treating acute inpatients and partial hospitalization patients. She has also been involved in community psychiatry and research.  
**Delusional Disorder Expertise:** In her hospital role, Dr. Agarwal frequently cares for patients in the throes of delusions – including those with **delusional disorder who decompensated under stress** or were brought in due to safety concerns. This gives her substantial expertise in **rapid stabilization of delusional thinking**. Moreover, she often continues treating patients after discharge in the outpatient clinic, guiding those with delusional disorder through the longer journey of maintaining reality testing outside the hospital. She is skilled at identifying when a belief is truly delusional versus a strongly held but plausible idea, ensuring appropriate diagnosis. Her experience covers all subtypes: persecutory (most common), jealous type, somatic type, etc.  
**Core Competencies:** Dr. Agarwal is particularly good at **building therapeutic rapport quickly**, a crucial skill with delusional patients who may initially mistrust providers. She uses a mix of **supportive therapy and gentle challenging** while the patient is on medications to reinforce gains made during hospitalization. She’s also knowledgeable about **court-ordered treatment and conservatorships** if a patient’s delusions make them a danger – though she aims to avoid coercive measures by gaining cooperation. Additionally, she has published on cultural factors in psychosis, making her adept at handling culturally influenced delusions (e.g., delusions with religious themes). *Patient Feedback:* As a county psychiatrist, formal patient reviews are limited, but the feedback that does exist is very positive. Colleagues say patients often request to follow up with Dr. Agarwal specifically because **“she listens and genuinely cares.”** Patients have described her as **“very smart and also kind-hearted,”** noting that she doesn’t dismiss their fears and instead works with them over time. Many families have expressed appreciation for her efforts in helping their loved ones gain insight.  
**Telehealth & Availability:** Dr. Agarwal’s clinic offers **telehealth follow-ups**, which she has embraced, especially for check-ins with patients who have transportation issues or lingering paranoia about leaving home. For out-of-pocket patients, the county system does provide services (on a sliding scale); Dr. Agarwal does see uninsured/self-pay patients via the Valley Medical outpatient program【80†L9-L17】. While one typically needs to go through the county intake to see her, those who prefer her expertise could arrange a **one-time private consultation** (she has done external consultations when referred). In all, she is an experienced, empathetic psychiatrist available to those navigating the challenging realm of delusional disorders.

With over 10 years of dedicated schizophrenia treatment and impeccable patient ratings, Dr. Nemes offers reliable and effective care. His focused clinical practice and strong feedback support his recommendation, even as his overall experience is slightly less than some peers.

**Preference 11: Dr. Sharon Jose, MD (Score: 8.0)**  
Specializing in delusional disorder with 10 years of experience, Dr. Sharon Jose has built a reputation for strong telehealth services and favorable patient reviews. Her clear focus on delusional conditions and effective communication make her a solid candidate despite a shorter practice tenure.

**Preference 12: Dr. Sukhdeep K. Ahuja, MD (Score: 7.5)**  
With 27 years of experience in schizophrenia care, Dr. Ahuja brings considerable clinical acumen from her county hospital background, though public patient reviews are less robust. Her expertise is unquestionable, but lower visibility in online ratings slightly tempers her overall ranking.

**Preference 13: Dr. Colin D. Buzza, MD, MPH (Score: 7.5)**  
Dr. Buzza, with 11 years of focused experience and a strong academic affiliation at UCSF, shows clear commitment to treating schizophrenia. However, the limited volume of publicly available patient reviews keeps his ranking moderate despite his solid clinical competence.

**Preference 14: Dr. Dan Tzuang, MD (Score: 7.5)**  
Dr. Tzuang has built a strong reputation with over a decade of experience and very high ratings, yet potential geographic ambiguity due to recent practice relocation lowers his overall ranking slightly. His expertise in schizophrenia remains clear, but ease of booking may require further verification.

**Preference 15: Dr. Michael Rogers, MD (Score: 7.5)**  
As a forensic psychiatrist with 12 years of experience, Dr. Rogers specializes in delusional disorder within legal contexts, which is a narrower focus than the others. While his expertise is clear, the limited breadth of patient reviews and specialized niche warrant a moderate overall score.

**Preference 16: Dr. Kenneth Gee, MD (Score: 7.5)**  
Dr. Gee brings 33 years of experience to treating delusional disorder and related conditions but is primarily hospital-based, with fewer publicly available patient testimonials. His extensive experience is balanced by limited online feedback, placing him in a moderate ranking bracket.

**Preference 17: Dr. Juliet Jenkins, MD (Score: 7.5)**  
With 16 years of experience and a clear interest in delusional disorders, Dr. Jenkins offers a solid clinical profile despite having fewer online reviews. Her practice is competent and focused, though the relative lack of publicly verifiable patient satisfaction data affects her overall score.

**Preference 18: Dr. Paul Linde, MD (Score: 7.0)**  
Dr. Linde’s 37 years of experience in schizophrenia is exceptional, but his current unavailability to accept new patients significantly impacts his ranking. Despite his deep expertise and excellent clinical track record, limited accessibility lowers his overall recommendation score.

**Preference 19: Dr. Jafar Bozorgmehr, MD (Score: 7.0)**  
With over 25 years of experience in schizophrenia care, Dr. Bozorgmehr is highly knowledgeable; however, mixed patient reviews and average satisfaction scores have reduced his priority. His clinical acumen is notable, but variable patient feedback and administrative concerns warrant a lower score.

**Preference 20: Dr. Rashi Agarwal, MD (Score: 7.0)**  
Dr. Agarwal offers 19 years of experience in treating delusional disorder and related conditions, primarily within a county system where patient testimonials are fewer. Although her clinical expertise is solid, the limited availability of robust online patient feedback and a less flexible booking model have kept her ranking lower.

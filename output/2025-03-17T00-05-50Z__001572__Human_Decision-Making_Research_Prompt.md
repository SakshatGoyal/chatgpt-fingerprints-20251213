# Human Decision-Making Research Prompt

## You (2025-03-17T00:05:50.747000+00:00)

hey Andrew, help me write a prompt. this is a follow up to a previous prompt i used for operator.

Goal & Core Objective:
Refine the research-oriented prompt to instruct the operator explicitly to identify academic papers that focus deeply on human decision-making processes, methodologies, and approaches, ensuring all selected research papers are accessible through the University of Washington's institutional access.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Clearly state the need to prioritize the human element—specifically, cognitive processes, decision-making behaviors, methodologies, and approaches used by individuals or groups.

Include explicit instructions to verify the accessibility of each selected paper via the University of Washington's institutional login.

Request initial verification by retrieving and confirming the availability of a small batch of relevant papers before proceeding to an extensive search.

Emphasize limiting the search to databases and platforms explicitly accessible through the University of Washington's library or institutional credentials.


Constraints & Assumptions:

Assume the user's access is strictly limited to publications that allow login via University of Washington credentials.

Do not include research papers from sources without institutional login options or paywalled without institutional coverage.

Initial response should include only 3-5 verified papers before proceeding with a broader search.

Context & Background:

Previous prompt aimed to locate academic research papers but lacked sufficient focus on human-centric decision-making methodologies.

Initial papers found lacked depth in addressing practical, cognitive, and human-oriented insights into decision-making processes.

User explicitly indicated limited access to papers due to university-specific login restrictions.

Persona & Role Definition:

Assume the role of an academic research assistant knowledgeable in navigating university-accessible academic databases.

Iterative Refinement Prompt:

After the initial batch, prompt the user to validate whether the depth, approach, and accessibility meet their expectations and refine accordingly if necessary.


Original Prompt for Operator:

Objective:
We are conducting a comprehensive data collection effort on Business-Level Strategy decision-making with a strong emphasis on real-world human-centered decision-making and AI integration. The primary goal is to gather a large, structured list of high-quality, relevant academic and industry sources—without any summarization or explanation.

🔹 Key Modifications Based on Prior Concerns:

Emphasis on Human Decision-Making: While AI applications remain relevant, the research should prioritize human decision-making frameworks, mental models, and real-world executive behavior—how business leaders think, act, and decide today.
Stronger Focus on Non-AI-Specific Decision Research: Ensure the collection includes non-AI-focused resources that analyze executive decision-making behavior, strategic thinking, cognitive biases, and high-level leadership approaches.
Checkpoint Before Full Execution: Before proceeding with the full data collection, conduct a small-scale proof of concept—gathering a subset of 5–7 links per category to validate alignment with expectations. If the results are not satisfactory, refine the approach before continuing.
🔹 Scope of Research

The search should cover six major business strategy decision scenarios, with an emphasis on:
✅ Decision-making models & mental frameworks (How executives structure their decisions)
✅ Executive behavior, cognitive biases, and real-world strategy execution
✅ AI applications in decision-making (only as a supporting aspect, not the sole focus)
✅ Case studies of business strategy in action
✅ Industry research on best practices, decision bottlenecks, and emerging trends

Key Decision Scenarios:
1️⃣ Market Expansion – How executives assess market entry risks, choose strategic partnerships, and allocate resources for expansion.
2️⃣ Product & Service Positioning – How leaders make trade-offs between differentiation, market fit, and innovation.
3️⃣ Resource Allocation – How business units allocate budgets, talent, and investments strategically.
4️⃣ Competitive Response – How organizations react to competitors, industry shifts, and disruptions.
5️⃣ Channel & Distribution Strategy – How companies optimize distribution channels, partnerships, and logistics.
6️⃣ Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) – How executives evaluate acquisition targets, conduct due diligence, and integrate companies post-merger.

For each scenario, the search must focus on both AI-enhanced and traditional decision-making methods, ensuring a broad and deep understanding of executive strategy formulation.

🔹 Strict Source Prioritization

Only retrieve sources from the following trusted academic, industry, and executive insights platforms:

✅ Academic Journals (For frameworks and theoretical models)

Strategic Management Journal, Harvard Business Review (HBR), MIT Sloan Management Review, California Management Review
Google Scholar, SSRN, ResearchGate (Only peer-reviewed research papers—no preprints or non-reviewed articles)
✅ Industry Reports & White Papers (For real-world strategy applications and consulting insights)

Consulting Firms: McKinsey, BCG, Gartner, Forrester, Deloitte Insights
Think Tanks & Research Institutions: OECD, World Economic Forum, Brookings Institution
✅ Conference Proceedings (For AI applications in strategy & decision science)

AI & Strategy Research: NeurIPS, INFORMS, AAAI
Business Strategy Conferences: Academy of Management, Strategic Management Society
✅ Books & Executive Insights (For firsthand perspectives from decision-makers)

Publisher links to books like: Hit Refresh (Satya Nadella), The Hard Thing About Hard Things (Ben Horowitz)
Google Books, Amazon, or publisher sites ONLY—no blog summaries
❌ DO NOT include:

Blog posts, news articles, or generic business opinion pieces
Medium, Forbes, Business Insider, or unverified sources
Non-reviewed or low-quality sources
🔹 Search Criteria & Precision

To ensure maximum relevance, apply the following filters:

✅ Date Range:
For AI-driven strategy insights: Focus on papers from 2019 onward to reflect the latest trends.
For traditional decision-making research: Prioritize recent papers, but do not exclude heavily cited foundational research (even if older), as some decision models remain relevant for decades.
✅ Search Query Design (Boolean Operators Required):
The research should use structured Boolean searches to maximize precision. Queries should combine:

Scenario Keywords
Decision-Making Models & Frameworks
Human Behavior & Cognitive Biases
AI-Related Terms (when applicable, not mandatory)
Example Search Queries:

For traditional decision-making research (non-AI focused):

(“Market expansion” AND “executive decision-making” AND “risk assessment”)
(“Competitive response” AND “decision frameworks” AND “behavioral strategy”)
(“Resource allocation” AND “cognitive biases” AND “budget prioritization”)
For AI-enhanced decision-making (where relevant):

(“Product positioning” AND “machine learning” AND “customer sentiment analysis”)
(“M&A strategy” AND “AI valuation models” AND “post-merger integration”)
✅ Resource Screening:
All sources must meet at least one of the following criteria:
✅ Contains a clear framework or structured decision-making model
✅ Includes real-world case studies with executive decision data
✅ Offers comparative studies evaluating multiple decision frameworks
✅ Provides visual frameworks that simplify complex concepts

🔹 Checkpoint: Proof of Concept Before Full Execution

Before proceeding with the full data collection, first conduct a small-scale test:

1️⃣ Gather 5–7 links per decision scenario (total ~30–40 links).
2️⃣ Deliver the test batch in the structured output format (see below).
3️⃣ Pause for review and validation.
4️⃣ If the proof of concept meets expectations, proceed with full execution (8–10 links per category).
5️⃣ If necessary, refine search strategies before scaling.

🔹 Output Format: Structured Table of Hyperlinked Sources

All resources should be organized by decision scenario and formatted as follows:

Structured List of Resources by Decision Scenario:
Decision Scenario: Market Expansion
Resource Link: [Link to Research Paper]
Justification: Covers executive decision-making processes in market entry risk analysis.

Decision Scenario: Product Positioning
Resource Link: [Link to Academic Paper]

Before crafting the optimized prompt for GPT-4o, let's clarify some essential points to ensure it precisely meets your expectations:

1. **Depth and Specificity:**
   - When mentioning "deeply on human decision-making," could you clarify if your main interest lies more in cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, executive psychology, organizational behavior, or a mix?
   - Are you primarily interested in theoretical frameworks, empirical studies, or practical methodologies applied in real-world scenarios?

2. **Accessibility Verification:**
   - Would you like explicit instructions for the operator to verify institutional accessibility by attempting direct login/download through the University of Washington’s library portal?
   - Should the verification step explicitly include a screenshot confirmation or simply a statement confirming accessibility?

3. **Initial Test Batch:**
   - You've indicated an initial batch of 3–5 papers for accessibility validation—do you prefer these initial papers to cover multiple decision-making scenarios, or is it acceptable for them to be more general yet deeply relevant to human decision-making methodologies?

4. **Institutional Database Restrictions:**
   - Would you like the prompt to specify explicitly any preferred databases (e.g., JSTOR, ProQuest, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect) to prioritize based on University of Washington access?

5. **Output Structure:**
   - Beyond hyperlinks and brief justifications, do you require additional metadata (e.g., authors, publication year, journal name) to quickly assess relevance before deeper evaluation?

Please confirm or refine these aspects so I can produce a structured, precise, and highly effective prompt tailored specifically to your requirements for GPT-4o.

1. Depth and Specificity

-- a mix of all
-- more interested in practical methodologies applied in real-world scenarios

2.

-- Yes
-- Simply a statement is fine. I don't want it to keep probing me for each resource, just make sure on its own whether its accessible to people from university of washington

3.

-- We can ignore the initial test batch. I found out these issues after it gave me the initial test batch, so not we can proceed with the full fledged research activity.

4.

-- Yes, this is in addition to my original instructions around accessing papers from harvard business review, etc...

5. no, no metadata.

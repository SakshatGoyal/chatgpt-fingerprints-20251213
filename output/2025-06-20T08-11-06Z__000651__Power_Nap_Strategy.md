Got it. You’re low on time and need a quick recharge. Here’s how to make the most of it:

---

### ✅ **Best Option: Power Nap with a Safety Net**
1. **Set two alarms:**
   - One for **1 hour 50 minutes** from now (to let you wake more gently).
   - Another one for **exactly 2 hours** (your backup).

2. **Darken the room completely** (or use a sleep mask). Keep your phone on **Do Not Disturb**—except alarms.

3. **Lie down, but elevate your feet slightly** (a pillow under your calves) to improve circulation and deepen rest quickly.

4. **Don’t try to fall asleep—just rest**. Focus on your breath (e.g., 4-second inhale, 7-second hold, 8-second exhale). That alone can trick your brain into deeper rest.

### 🧠 Bonus Hack (if you're groggy when you wake):
Right after waking up:
- **Splash cold water on your face**
- **Expose yourself to bright light (or go near a window)**
- If you have **chai ready**, sip it warm to gently ramp up focus.

But none of that ever works. I always end up sleeping too much

Thanks for being real. If you *always* oversleep, it means your brain overrides alarms when you're in deep sleep. You need a **wake-up system that forces interaction**, not just noise.

### 🛑 **Hard Truth**: You can’t rely on willpower after 2 hours of sleep.

So here's a better **no-fail strategy**:

---

### 🔔 **Plan That *Forces* You Awake in 2 Hours**
#### 1. **Use an Alarm That Forces Action**
If you have your phone:

- **Install Alarmy (iOS/Android)** — it can make you:
  - Take a photo of something specific (e.g., your bathroom sink)
  - Solve a math problem
  - Shake your phone 30 times

That forces your brain online. Regular alarms won’t do this.

#### 2. **Place Your Phone Far From Bed**
Put it somewhere that requires you to **get out of bed and walk** to turn it off. Even better: place it in the bathroom with the light on.

#### 3. **Drink a Glass of Water *Now***
It’ll increase your chance of waking naturally to pee within 2 hours. That’s nature’s alarm clock. Seriously.

---

### ⏲️ Optional: Shorten Nap to 90 Minutes
If you *really* can’t risk oversleeping, sleep for **90 minutes**, not 2 hours. That avoids deep sleep (and helps you wake less groggy).

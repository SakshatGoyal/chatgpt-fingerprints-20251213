Doenjang Jjigae (된장찌개) – Korean Fermented Soybean Stew
A classic Korean comfort food, Doenjang Jjigae is a nutrient-packed, umami-rich stew made with fermented soybean paste (doenjang), vegetables, and tofu. Traditionally, it includes zucchini, mushrooms, potatoes, and onions, but we’ll modify it to include carrots, green beans, cauliflower, cabbage, and kimchi while keeping it authentic.

🥬 Ingredients (Serves 2-3)
Main Ingredients
✅ 2 cups water or vegetable broth (for depth of flavor)
✅ 2 tbsp Doenjang (fermented soybean paste)
✅ 1 tsp Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) (optional, for mild heat)
✅ 1 tbsp Soy sauce (for umami balance)
✅ 1 clove Garlic, minced
✅ ½ block Firm Tofu, cut into cubes

Vegetables (Modified for Your Request)
✅ ½ cup Carrots, julienned or thinly sliced
✅ ½ cup Green Beans, cut into 2-inch pieces
✅ ½ cup Cauliflower florets
✅ ½ cup Cabbage, chopped
✅ ¼ cup Kimchi, chopped (with a bit of kimchi juice for extra tang)

Garnish & Optional Add-ins
✅ 1 Green Onion, chopped (for garnish)
✅ 1 tsp Sesame Oil (for extra fragrance)
✅ 1 tbsp Sesame Seeds (for a crunchy finish)

🔥 Instructions
Step 1: Prepare the Base
1️⃣ In a medium pot, heat 2 cups of water or vegetable broth over medium heat.
2️⃣ Add doenjang paste, soy sauce, minced garlic, and gochugaru (if using). Stir well to dissolve the doenjang completely.

Step 2: Add Vegetables & Simmer
3️⃣ Add carrots, green beans, cauliflower, cabbage, and kimchi to the pot. Stir to combine.
4️⃣ Cover and let simmer for 10 minutes, allowing the vegetables to soften and absorb the doenjang flavor.

Step 3: Add Tofu & Final Touches
5️⃣ Add cubed tofu and gently stir. Let cook for another 5 minutes until tofu is heated through.
6️⃣ Taste and adjust seasoning with more doenjang or soy sauce if needed.

Step 4: Serve & Garnish
7️⃣ Remove from heat and drizzle with sesame oil for extra depth.
8️⃣ Garnish with chopped green onions and sesame seeds before serving.

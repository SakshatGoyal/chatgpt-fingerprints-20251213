# Palo Alto UI Design

## You (2025-05-07T00:25:19.450000+00:00)

You are a prompt engineer creating a Bolt prompt that converts the following product requirements document (PRD) into a UI design customized for Palo Alto Networks.
Your task is to generate a Bolt-ready prompt that:
Preserves the original PRD’s layout, component logic, and persona context.
Transforms the PRD content into a Palo Alto Networks–specific version using real or plausible product-level telemetry, terminology, and UI style conventions from PAN’s platforms (e.g., Cortex XSOAR, Prisma Access, Panorama, Cortex Data Lake).
In the output, Bolt should be guided to:
Retain section headers, structure, and roles from the original PRD.
Modify metrics, actions, and AI insights to use Palo Alto Networks–style telemetry (e.g., threat log volumes, policy misalignment, deployment lag across zones).
Adapt UI elements (cards, dashboards, panels) to match PAN’s visual grammar:
Blue-gray UI palette (not corporate yellow/orange).
Modular card layout with clear hierarchy and high data density.
Collapsible side navigation and timeline elements as used in PAN tools.
Use PAN-specific microcopy and interface language (e.g., “Security Posture Drift”, “Playbook Invocation via XSOAR”, “Adoption Lag: Config vs. Runtime Delta”).
Format the output as a prompt ready to be pasted into Bolt, not as a rewritten PRD.
Be direct, structured, and use clear language that Bolt can interpret to generate UI.

PRD:
### Title: Unified Dashboard – Customer Success Manager (CSM) View

**Codename:** *Command View CSM*

---

## 1. 📌 Executive Summary

This dashboard is a modular, role-aware workspace for CSMs to monitor and act on customer health across technical, deployment, adoption, and value dimensions. It reuses shared components with the SC dashboard to support design scalability, but adapts them with **context-specific insights and workflows** for post-sale action.

---

## 2. 🧑‍💼 Target User: Customer Success Manager (CSM)

### Core Needs:

- Real-time health visibility across customer accounts.
- Clear, prescriptive signals on where to intervene.
- Shared understanding of customer progress aligned to pre-sale expectations.
- Frictionless collaboration with AEs, SCs, and support.
- Evidence-based guidance (via telemetry + AI) for renewals and expansions.

---

## 3. 🎯 Cross-Persona Platform Goals

| Goal | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Component Reuse** | Dashboard uses common cards (Health, Timeline, AI Nudges, Quick Actions) shared with SC dashboard. |
| **Visual and Interaction Consistency** | CSM and SC see the same data types visualized similarly—only context and actions differ. |
| **Integrated Narrative** | Shared “Customer Storyline” from POV to Renewal, visible through timeline and linked artifacts. |

---

## 4. 🖥️ Dashboard Layout Overview (Shared + Specialized)

| **Section** | **Shared UI Component** | **CSM-Specific Adaptation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Header** | Account Overview | Renewal date, current lifecycle stage, assigned CSM, overall health status. |
| **Health Summary Cards** | Modular health indicators | Emphasizes: Adoption, Deployment TTV, Technical Health, Sentiment. |
| **Timeline** | Event stream | Highlights onboarding, adoption milestones, escalations, QBRs. |
| **AI Insights Panel** | Nudges & Recommendations | Focused on churn risk, delayed adoption, renewal blockers. |
| **Quick Actions** | Prescriptive Playbooks | "Trigger Adoption Playbook", "Escalate to SC", "Request Support Artifact". |
| **Linked Artifacts** | DoR / Success Plan access | Allows retrospective alignment: “Is what we’re delivering what was sold?” |

---

## 5. 🤖 AI Integration Strategy

### Philosophy:

- **Transparency over prescriptive automation**
- **Assistive AI** that surfaces actions, not decisions

### Capabilities:

- Predicts churn risk based on trend deviations.
- Identifies outlier accounts based on segment baselines.
- Suggests proven playbooks for similar accounts at risk.
- Surfaces success stories of interventions that worked.

> ✳️ Note: Same underlying AI model used in SC dashboard, but prompts + outputs adapted for post-sale focus.
> 

---

## 6. 🛠️ Functional Requirements

| Feature | Description | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Modular Health Cards | Visual status for Technical, Deployment, Adoption, Sentiment. | High |
| Timeline | Customer journey milestones with engagement markers. | High |
| AI Nudges | Risk insights + suggested interventions. | High |
| Playbook Actions | Launches pre-defined workflows (via SFDC integration or internal systems). | High |
| Artifact Access | Read-only view of Design of Record, Success Plan, Product Configs. | Medium |
| Salesforce Contextual View | Can embed in SFDC account detail page. | High |

---

## 7. 🧪 Success Metrics

- Reduction in surprise churn or escalations.
- Increase in proactive interventions (playbooks triggered).
- Higher CSM satisfaction with visibility and insight.
- Alignment with SC-created expectations.

---

## 8. 🧭 Design Principles

- **Same Structure, Different Story**: Keep UI skeletal structure aligned with SC dashboard.
- **Persona-Based Semantics**: A red Adoption Card means something different to a CSM (risk) than to an SC (missed alignment).
- **Assisted Action, Not Automation**: AI never hides the “why” behind a nudge.
- **Low Friction, High Signal**: Information density is high, but cognitive load is light.

## ChatGPT (2025-05-07T00:26:57.689961+00:00)

Here's the Bolt-ready prompt tailored specifically for Palo Alto Networks. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

## You (2025-05-07T00:34:12.467000+00:00)

{'content_type': 'image_asset_pointer', 'asset_pointer': 'file-service://file-WjZZ2iaPRRGucEkX3yTwUj', 'size_bytes': 537609, 'width': 2048, 'height': 1355, 'fovea': None, 'metadata': {'dalle': None, 'gizmo': None, 'generation': None, 'container_pixel_height': None, 'container_pixel_width': None, 'emu_omit_glimpse_image': None, 'emu_patches_override': None, 'lpe_keep_patch_ijhw': None, 'lpe_delta_encoding_channel': None, 'sanitized': True, 'asset_pointer_link': None, 'watermarked_asset_pointer': None, 'is_no_auth_placeholder': None}}
the output looks something like this. first off, its not quite what I expected because visually its simply not balanced. you see how there's so much white space below the health cards. also the quick actions are sort of clumped together. This is when i had to zoom out. at a 100% zoom level, its way too clumped and squished together. Help me with a set of instructions i can use to make these and any other necessary changes. We also do need the palo alto networks logo.

## ChatGPT (2025-05-07T00:34:13.380601+00:00)

Here's a set of clear, structured instructions you can use to guide Bolt (or manually direct a UI designer) to make the necessary refinements to improve visual balance and usability of the dashboard:

### Layout Adjustments:
- **Vertical Balance:**  
  **Issue:** Excessive whitespace below Health Summary Cards.  
  **Instruction:**  
  - Expand the "Health Summary Cards" vertically or redistribute cards into two rows of two cards each, maximizing use of vertical space.
  - Align the bottom edge of "Health Summary Cards" evenly with the bottom edge of the "Security Health Score" card to achieve visual alignment and symmetry.

- **Spacing and Padding:**  
  **Issue:** Quick Actions panel overly dense and visually cramped.  
  **Instruction:**  
  - Increase padding within each Quick Action button/card to improve readability and reduce clutter.
  - Introduce consistent, generous spacing between Quick Action items (at least 24px gap between each button).
  - Increase the minimum width of Quick Actions panel or redistribute buttons into two clearly defined columns to balance density and readability.

### Typography & Visual Hierarchy:
- **Card Titles & Labels:**  
  - Ensure uniform font weight and size across all modular card titles (Health Cards, AI Insights, Quick Actions) to reinforce consistent visual hierarchy.
  - Slightly increase the size of primary action buttons text ("Run Security Posture Remediation," "Escalate to Solution Consultant," etc.) to immediately draw attention.

### Palo Alto Networks Branding:
- **Logo Placement:**  
  **Instruction:**  
  - Place the Palo Alto Networks logo prominently on the top-left corner of the header (next to or integrated with the dashboard codename “Command View CSM”).
  - Ensure the logo follows official PAN branding guidelines and color palette.

- **Color Palette & Accents:**  
  - Verify use of PAN’s official blue-gray primary colors for card backgrounds and sidebar navigation.
  - Accentuate actionable and critical UI elements (alerts, escalations) with PAN-standard alert red/orange colors, consistent across all cards and buttons.

### UI Component Consistency:
- **Alignment and Grid Structure:**  
  - Implement a consistent grid structure across the entire dashboard with clearly defined columns and margins for balanced visual flow.
  - Align left edges of the "AI Insights & Recommendations" and "Quick Actions" panels to maintain a coherent and easily scannable structure.

- **Responsive Adjustments:**  
  - Ensure components dynamically adjust to standard zoom levels (especially 100%) without visual compression.
  - Verify spacing and sizing integrity across different screen resolutions to avoid layout distortion or density issues.

These instructions can be directly input into Bolt or provided as actionable feedback for manual design refinement, ensuring alignment with PAN-specific visual standards and user-friendly information density.

## ChatGPT (2025-05-07T00:49:45.257602+00:00)

I've updated your existing Bolt-ready prompt to seamlessly integrate the Solution Consultant (SC) view alongside the Customer Success Manager (CSM) view, including instructions for easy switching through the User Profile Icon in the header. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to refine!

## You (2025-05-07T00:50:12.452000+00:00)

how do i know the Bolt won't just delete what it previously did while executing on this.

## ChatGPT (2025-05-07T00:50:13.340282+00:00)

Bolt might overwrite previous UI outputs if it interprets the instructions as generating a completely new design rather than augmenting the existing one. To prevent this, explicitly instruct Bolt to:

1. **"Retain the existing Command View CSM UI entirely."**
2. **"Add the Command View SC as an additional role accessible via the User Profile Icon."**
3. **"Reuse and adapt existing modular UI components (cards, timelines, panels) rather than recreating them."**
4. Clearly state that the SC dashboard is an **extension or parallel view** rather than a replacement.

Here's a concise instruction snippet you can use to clarify:

> "**Bolt Instructions:**  
> - Do NOT remove or alter the existing Command View CSM UI.  
> - Implement the SC view as an additional, parallel dashboard accessible through the existing User Profile Icon.  
> - Reuse all shared UI components (cards, timelines, side navigation) from the CSM view. Only update telemetry, terminology, actions, and specific SC-adapted content as defined.  
> - Preserve the original visual style, layout, and alignment to ensure seamless role switching without loss of UI state or data visibility."

Including this instruction explicitly at the beginning of your Bolt prompt ensures clarity about extending, not replacing, the existing UI.

## You (2025-05-07T00:51:07.910000+00:00)

ok, now could you modify this new prompt to incorporate this feedback and set of instructions.

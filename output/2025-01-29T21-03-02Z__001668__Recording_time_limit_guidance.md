# Recording time limit guidance



## You (2025-01-29T21:03:02.883389+00:00)

How long can I continue recording this until I run out of time?

FYI, I used the speech to text option in my chatgpt phone app

The recording time limit for the speech-to-text feature in the ChatGPT app depends on the platform (iOS or Android), but typically, it lasts for about **1–2 minutes per input** before automatically stopping. If you reach the limit, you'll need to restart the recording to continue dictating.

Would you like me to suggest ways to streamline long dictations?

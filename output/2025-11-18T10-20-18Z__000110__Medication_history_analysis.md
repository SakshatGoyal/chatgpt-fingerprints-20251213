# Medication history analysis

## You (2025-11-18T10:20:18.156000+00:00)

### **🧭 Goal**

Analyze and evaluate the longitudinal psychiatric medication history of Suparna Goyal, with the objective of determining:

1. Which medications have demonstrably worked or failed, and why.
2. The underlying pharmacological or diagnostic reasons behind the persistent tremors (EPS, TD, or otherwise).
3. The mechanism of action and clinical rationale of each medication used—both successful and unsuccessful.
4. The psychological, behavioral, and motor impact of each treatment phase.
5. An optimal, evidence-supported recommendation for a medication regimen, based on the historical evidence and best psychiatric practices for treatment-resistant schizophrenia with severe delusional dietary control and poor adherence.

### **⚠️ Warnings & Guardrails**

* Avoid assumptions unsupported by the clinical history provided.
* Clearly **distinguish speculation from evidence** (e.g., hallucinations have *not* been reported—don’t overweigh antipsychotics for that symptom).
* Maintain neutrality regarding psychiatrist intentions—report observed patterns, not motives.
* Do not prescribe—this is a clinical reasoning task for educational or preparatory purposes only.
* Patient has historically demonstrated extreme control behaviors, dietary delusions, and poor insight—medication effectiveness should be judged **behaviorally and relationally**, not just via internal symptom reports.

### **📚 Context & Additional Elements**

While the goal is making sure we don't miss on the nuances and details, maintain a language that can be interpreted by a patient's family.

## ChatGPT (2025-11-18T10:30:44.604015+00:00)

Below is a structured, evidence‑based read of Suparna Goyal’s longitudinal record, written in plain language for the family and usable by her treating clinicians. This is a **clinical reasoning exercise, not a prescription.** All concrete events and doses come from your case file; literature citations are provided where mechanisms or best‑practice guidance are discussed.

---

## What the longitudinal record shows at a glance

- **Most dependable stabilizer so far:** **Olanzapine** (Oleanz/Olimet/Tolaz DT). Each time it was restarted or up‑titrated, basic household functioning improved; when reduced or stopped, relapse followed quickly (fasting, aggression, extreme control). fileciteturn0file0
- **Agents that worsened or unmasked disabling movements:** **Risperidone** (oral) and **Paliperidone LAI** (Palaris). Shaking began/worsened after risperidone was introduced and olanzapine/aripiprazole were stopped; movements remained prominent on paliperidone LAI; “fast‑acting injections” precipitated severe shaking episodes. Tremor fell noticeably during a 7‑day washout—strongly suggesting **antipsychotic‑induced movement disorder**. fileciteturn0file0
- **Adjunct that has helped without obvious worsening of movements:** **Aripiprazole** (Arip/Asprito) as add‑on to olanzapine, with modest gains in engagement; alone it was not fully tested. fileciteturn0file0
- **EPS treatments so far:** **Trihexyphenidyl (Pacitane)** and later **Propranolol (Betacap TR)**—with **incomplete benefit**; high Pacitane doses (up to 8 mg/day) were used. fileciteturn0file0
- **Antidepressant present much of the time:** **Escitalopram (Nexito)**—likely helped anxiety/irritability but **does not treat core psychosis** and can contribute to tremor or QTc risk when combined with antipsychotics. fileciteturn0file0

## **Section 2: Medication Mechanism Overview (with literature)**

> *Indian brand names in parentheses; key interactions noted for the combinations actually used.*

**Olanzapine (Oleanz/Olimet/Tolaz DT) – SGA**
- **Mechanism**: Antagonist at **D2** and **5‑HT2A** (plus H1/α1), with relatively **loose D2 binding** → lower acute EPS risk than high‑potency agents.
- **Role**: First‑line SGA for schizophrenia; in many patients improves agitation and delusional rigidity.
- **Common AEs**: Weight gain, metabolic syndrome; comparatively **lower EPS** than risperidone/paliperidone.
- **Interactions in this case**: With **escitalopram**, additive QT risk is modest but monitoring is prudent (escitalopram has dose‑dependent QT effects).

**Risperidone – SGA**
- **Mechanism**: Potent **D2/5‑HT2A** antagonist; EPS risk **dose‑dependent** and can emerge early after dose changes.
- **Role**: Effective antipsychotic but **higher EPS and prolactin** than many SGAs.
- **AEs**: Acute dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism; tardive dyskinesia with chronic use.
- **Interactions**: **Escitalopram** adds QTc risk; risperidone’s active metabolite is **paliperidone** (9‑hydroxyrisperidone).

**Paliperidone / Paliperidone Palmitate LAI (Palaris/Invega Sustenna)**
- **Mechanism**: **9‑hydroxyrisperidone (active risperidone metabolite)**; D2/5‑HT2A blockade; LAI provides steady plasma levels.
- **Role**: Maintenance treatment; useful for adherence problems but carries **EPS/hyperprolactinemia** risk similar to risperidone.
- **AEs**: EPS, hyperprolactinemia; injection‑site reactions.
- **Interactions**: QTc caution if combined with other QT‑prolonging drugs (e.g., escitalopram). Labeling advises general caution in cardiovascular disease.

**Aripiprazole (Arip/Asprito) – SGA, D2 partial agonist**
- **Mechanism**: **Partial agonist at D2 and 5‑HT1A; antagonist at 5‑HT2A** → often **lower EPS**, can reduce prolactin; **akathisia** can occur.
- **Role**: Monotherapy or adjunct; also available as LAI (varies by country).
- **AEs**: Akathisia/restlessness, insomnia; generally low metabolic/EPS burden vs. risperidone/paliperidone.
- **Interactions**: Substrate of **CYP2D6/3A4**; escitalopram is not a strong inhibitor—clinically modest interaction.

**Trihexyphenidyl (Pacitane) – Anticholinergic (anti‑EPS)**
- **Mechanism/Role**: Anticholinergic for **antipsychotic‑induced parkinsonism/dystonia**. **Not recommended for tardive dyskinesia**; long‑term use increases cognitive burden, especially with aging.
- **AEs**: Dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, **cognitive impairment**; may **worsen TD**.

**Propranolol (Betacap TR) – Non‑selective β‑blocker**
- **Mechanism/Role**: **First‑line option for antipsychotic‑induced akathisia**; typical effective doses 30–80 mg/day in trials.
- **AEs**: Bradycardia, hypotension; avoid in asthma; evidence is supportive but not universal.

**Escitalopram (Nexito) – SSRI**
- **Mechanism**: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor for anxiety/depression.
- **AEs/Interactions**: Can cause tremor or akathisia; **QTc prolongation is dose‑dependent**—caution when combined with antipsychotics that may also affect QTc.

**Clonazepam (Lonazep) – Benzodiazepine**
- **Role**: Short‑term anxiolysis or adjunct for acute agitation/insomnia; long‑term use risks dependence and falls (especially in older adults). (Beers Criteria, general BZD cautions.)

**Haloperidol (probable component of “fast‑acting injections”) – FGA**
- **Mechanism/Role**: High‑potency D2 antagonist; rapid IM effect for agitation.
- **AEs**: **High risk of acute dystonia/akathisia and parkinsonism**, often **within hours–days** of dose or injection.

**Valbenazine (VMAT2 inhibitor)** – *discussed but not used*
- **Role**: **First‑line pharmacologic treatment for tardive dyskinesia (TD)**; robust RCT evidence (KINECT‑3).

**Clozapine** – *not yet tried; see plan*
- **Role**: **Gold‑standard for treatment‑resistant schizophrenia** (after failure of ≥2 antipsychotics); **lowest EPS risk** and can **improve tardive movements**. Requires blood count monitoring.

## **Section 3: Root‑Cause Analysis of Tremors & Abnormal Movements**

### A. Timeline of movements vs. meds
- **Nov 2022**: Involuntary head movements first noted while on **olanzapine 5 mg + trihexyphenidyl**—mild, not disabling. fileciteturn0file0
- **Mar–May 2025 (US)**: **Risperidone started and escalated; olanzapine/aripiprazole stopped** → **progressive shaking** of head, limbs, trunk. fileciteturn0file0
- **Late May–June 2025**: **7‑day washout** → **marked reduction** in tremors; residual movements persist. fileciteturn0file0
- **Jul–Oct 2025**: **Paliperidone LAI** → movements **remain significant**; **“fast‑acting injections”** trigger **severe shaking** episodes. fileciteturn0file0
- **Oct–Nov 2025**: **Pacitane up to 8 mg/day + Betacap TR 20 mg** under new regimen → **tremors less than May peak but still meaningful**. fileciteturn0file0

### B. Acute (DIP/akathisia) vs. tardive (TD) — likelihood
- **Features supporting *drug‑induced parkinsonism (DIP)* ± akathisia**
  - **Onset within weeks** of risperidone dose changes, a typical time‑course for **acute EPS**.
  - **Improved with antipsychotic washout**, which aligns with DIP.
  - **Exacerbation after IM “fast‑acting” injections**—consistent with acute dystonia/akathisia seen after high‑potency D2 blockade (e.g., haloperidol).
- **Features raising concern for a *tardive* component**
  - Movements **persist despite switches** and after some dose reductions; tardive syndromes often **persist or even worsen** with continued D2 blockade and can outlast discontinuation.
  - Early anticholinergic exposure (trihexyphenidyl) can **worsen TD risk** over time.

**Clinical read:** The record best fits **DIP (parkinsonian tremor) with superimposed akathisia**, **triggered by risperidone** and **sustained on paliperidone LAI**; a **tardive overlay** is **possible** given persistence and partial response only to anticholinergics. Differentiating DIP vs. TD matters because **anticholinergics help DIP but may worsen TD**. Use structured ratings (**SAS** for parkinsonism, **BARS** for akathisia, **AIMS** for TD) and video documentation to pin this down.

### C. Pacitane & Betacap effectiveness
- **Trihexyphenidyl (Pacitane)**: Appropriate for **DIP**, but **not for TD** and carries cognitive/anticholinergic burden with long‑term use; best kept **short‑term at lowest effective dose** while the offending D2 blockade is reduced.
- **Propranolol (Betacap)**: Evidence‑based for **akathisia**; partial benefit would point toward an akathisia component.

### D. Most likely culprits for movements (with rationale)
1. **Risperidone** – high likelihood: **temporal association** and clear **dose‑response**; strong D2 blockade with known EPS risk.
2. **Paliperidone LAI** – likely **sustained DIP**: pharmacologically the **active risperidone metabolite**; movements persisted under LAI.
3. **High‑potency IM injections (likely haloperidol)** – **provoked severe episodes** consistent with **acute dystonia/akathisia**.

---

## **Section 4: Ethical & Treatment Context Review**

- **Family’s concern re: Dr. Jyothirmayi and possible conflict with a clinic** is **documented** in the file. Regardless of motive (which we cannot judge), trust is currently thin, and trust strongly shapes adherence. The safest course is **transparent shared decision‑making**: written plans, side‑effect monitoring schedules, and explicit rationale for each change. fileciteturn0file0
- **Patterns to note**
  - **Abrupt antipsychotic switches/reductions** (e.g., stopping olanzapine while up‑titrating risperidone) preceded **behavioral relapse and EPS**. **Cross‑titration and one‑change‑at‑a‑time** would reduce this risk. (Guidelines discourage antipsychotic polypharmacy and recommend clozapine before resorting to combinations.)
  - **LAI paliperidone** was used to solve adherence; however, **EPS monitoring** (AIMS/SAS/BARS) and **VMAT2 consideration** when movements persisted are not described in the record. Current guidelines recognize **VMAT2 inhibitors** as first‑line for TD.
- **Guardrail**: Avoid heavy sedation or covert dosing to make the household “easier.” Instead, **simplify the regimen**, **monitor effects**, and keep the patient’s voice central, while protecting safety.

---

## **Section 5: Treatment Recommendation Plan (evidence‑supported, practical)**

> *Goal*: **Reduce movement disorder**, **restore behavioral stability**, and **improve adherence**, using the **fewest medicines at the lowest effective doses**.

### A) **Primary regimen (preferred path)**

**1) Decide DIP vs. TD clearly (within 2–3 weeks):**
- At the next visit, perform and record **SAS (parkinsonism), BARS (akathisia), and AIMS (TD)**; repeat **monthly** until stable, then every **6–12 months** (APA guidance). If smartphone/video is refused, do brief in‑person videos with consent or clinician‑rated forms.

**2) Remove the likely triggers and simplify to a single antipsychotic that has historically worked**
- **If movements look like DIP/akathisia predominately:**
  - **Consolidate to **olanzapine ODT** at the **lowest effective nightly dose** (historically 5–10 mg restored function). Avoid additional D2‑heavy agents. Keep **Pacitane** only **short‑term** while de‑blocking D2; **aim to taper it off** once stable. Consider **propranolol** short‑term if definite akathisia. fileciteturn0file0
- **If TD is present or cannot be excluded after assessment:**
  - **Do not escalate anticholinergics**; **consider a VMAT2 inhibitor (e.g., valbenazine)** while maintaining the **single antipsychotic with the lowest EPS liability** (olanzapine or **clozapine**—see below).

**3) Treat the schizophrenia as *treatment‑resistant* and plan a clozapine pathway**
- By history, **≥2 antipsychotics have been inadequate or poorly tolerated** (olanzapine helps but leaves disabling delusions; risperidone/paliperidone caused severe movements). **Guidelines recommend clozapine for TRS.** Start the **paperwork/logistics now** (home phlebotomy if possible; family escort if not). Clozapine has **lowest EPS risk** and may **improve tardive phenomena**.
- **Monitoring**: ANC monitoring remains recommended in labeling (**weekly 6 mo → q2 wk months 6–12 → monthly thereafter**; regulators are loosening REMS reporting but blood monitoring remains best practice).
- **Bridge while preparing for clozapine**: continue **olanzapine monotherapy**; stop add‑ons except **short‑term** Pacitane (if DIP) or **propranolol** (if akathisia). Cross‑titration to clozapine should be **slow and one‑variable‑at‑a‑time**.

### B) **Contingency / alternatives if clozapine is not feasible immediately**

1) **Stay with olanzapine monotherapy (ODT)** under **observed dosing** (pill seen on tongue and swallowed; ODT reduces “cheeking”).
2) **If adherence still collapses**, consider a **long‑acting option with lower EPS liability** than paliperidone/risperidone—**aripiprazole LAI** *only after* 2–4 weeks of proven **oral tolerability** and **no troublesome akathisia**. (Availability varies by region.)
3) **Avoid**: returning to **paliperidone/risperidone** (given the movement history), and **high‑potency IM antipsychotics** for agitation unless absolutely necessary; if an IM is needed, **IM olanzapine** is an alternative (with standard precautions).

### C) **Adherence strategies (practical, respectful)**

- **Daily observed dosing** by a **designated family member** (same person each day); **lockbox** storage; **simple one‑page checklist** for that day only.
- **Keep the regimen to 1 antipsychotic** plus **at most 1 movement‑aid** and **1 antidepressant** if clearly helpful. **Avoid polypharmacy** except during cross‑titration.
- **No covert dosing** while she retains capacity; instead, **clear agreements**: “If food refusal lasts >24 h or violence emerges, we go to the clinic/hospital.”

### D) **Recommended tests & monitoring**

- **Movement**: **AIMS, SAS, BARS** at baseline, **monthly** for 3 months, then **q3–6 mo**.
- **Metabolic (esp. with olanzapine/clozapine)**: weight, waist, BP, **fasting glucose/HbA1c**, **lipids** at baseline; at 3 months, then **q6–12 mo**.
- **Cardiac**: **ECG** if **escitalopram** is continued or if any antipsychotic with QT risk is used.
- **Endocrine & deficiencies**: **TSH** (given prior hypothyroidism), **B12**, **vitamin D**, **ferritin** (fatigue/restlessness mimics akathisia when iron‑deficient). fileciteturn0file0
- **Hematology (if clozapine)**: **ANC** per label (**weekly → q2 wk → monthly**), with local lab access arranged before the first dose.

---

## Why these recommendations fit this case

- **History favors olanzapine** as the only agent repeatedly associated with improvement in household functioning without major movement toxicity. **Risperidone/paliperidone** are the **strongest candidates for the disabling tremors**, consistent with their pharmacology and timing. fileciteturn0file0
- **Trihexyphenidyl** can help **DIP**, but if **TD** is present it **can worsen it**—hence the push to **measure** (AIMS/SAS/BARS), **minimize anticholinergic exposure**, and **use VMAT2 inhibitors** if TD is confirmed.
- Given severe, persistent delusions and **poor adherence**, **clozapine** offers the best **efficacy** with **lowest EPS** risk; if clozapine is not feasible, **observed olanzapine** or **aripiprazole LAI** (if tolerated) are second‑line adherence tools.

---

## Final cautions

- **One change at a time.** Each change (dose or drug) should be followed for **≥2 weeks** with rating scales so we can see cause and effect.
- **Avoid polypharmacy** outside of cross‑titration; if two antipsychotics are used, there should be a **short, explicit cross‑taper plan**.
- **If fasting, violence, or medical compromise recur**, **seek in‑person care urgently**. No remote plan is a substitute in those moments.

# **A Clear, Non-Medical Explanation of Suparna’s Long-Term Medication History, Her Tremors, and What It All Means**

I’m going to take you through **five main parts**:

1. **A simple timeline** of which medicines were tried, what helped, what harmed, and how she behaved during each period.
2. **What each medicine does** in the body and the brain (in plain speech).
3. **Why she developed tremors** and what type they most likely are.
4. **What went wrong in her treatment journey**, including trust issues.
5. **A practical, evidence-based plan** that a future doctor could use (for education; not prescribing).

I will treat you as partners in care, not as spectators.

---

# **1. The Timeline: What Worked, What Didn’t, and What Happened**

This table is the “story of her illness” told through her medicines. Think of it as watching patterns:
**When Olanzapine is present, she stabilizes. When it is removed or replaced, she collapses. When Risperidone/Paliperidone enters, tremors explode.**

### **A. June 2022 – August 2022**
**Started low-dose Olanzapine.**
- She was in terrible shape before this: fasting, screaming, pushing people away, terrified of everything.
- When Olanzapine was added, **she slowly got better**—more cooking, more basic functioning—even though she stayed isolated.
- Even early on, there were **small head movements** noted later.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **B. Aug–Nov 2022**
**Olanzapine increased to 5 mg + Pacitane (for movement-side-effects).**
- **Clear improvement** in daily behaviour.
- But the **involuntary head movement** was now visible.
- Still avoided family socially.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **C. Late 2022–Early 2023**
**Stopped Olanzapine → immediate crash.**
- Became isolated again, refusing food, refusing devices.
- When Olanzapine was restarted, she stabilized again.
- This pattern repeats many times: **On Olanzapine = stability. Off Olanzapine = collapse.**
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **D. March–June 2023**
On Olanzapine + Nexito (antidepressant) + Pacitane.
- Some improvement in sleep and routine.
- But severe **lying about medication**, **hiding pills**, **persistent isolation**, and **rigid food beliefs**.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **E. June–July 2024**
On Olanzapine 5 mg, then reduced to 2.5 mg.
- At 5 mg: **better activity**, cooking, chores.
- At 2.5 mg: **unstable, moody**, very restricted eating.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **F. Late July 2024**
**Low dose + poor adherence → sudden violent outburst.**
- Expelled daughter’s family.
- Pushed grandchild.
- Threw away food.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **G. Late July–Sept 2024**
**Completely off all medication.**
- **Extreme isolation**, total fasting.
- Forcing husband into same fasting.
- Confiscated devices, shut off Wi-Fi.
- Dangerous situation.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **H. Sept–Nov 2024**
**Family restarted Olanzapine (5→10 mg) + Nexito + Aripiprazole.**
- **Household returned to functioning.**
- Food delusions remained, but safety improved.
- She still avoided vegetables/dairy/nuts but wasn’t harming anyone.
fileciteturn0file0

---

### **I. Late Nov–Dec 2024**
A brief experiment replacing Olanzapine with “Rescon LS” + high Aripiprazole.
- **Immediate worsening**, aggression, food-snatching.
- Quickly reversed.

### **J. Dec 2024–Feb 2025**
Back to Olanzapine 10 mg + Nexito + Aripiprazole.
- Moderate stability.
- Still delusional about food.
- Came to the U.S. in Feb.

---

### **K. Mar–May 2025 (U.S.)**
**Major shift: Risperidone introduced. Olanzapine removed.**
- **This is when the severe shaking began and worsened.**
- Head, hands, legs, trunk all shaking.
- Tremors worsened as Risperidone dose increased.
- After Olanzapine removal, mental health also worsened.

### **L. Late May–June 2025 (India)**
**7-day medication washout → tremors reduced.**
- This proves the tremors were **medication-induced**, not a brain disease progressing.
- Restarted low-dose Olanzapine + Aripiprazole → moderate benefit, but tremors not completely gone.

---

### **M. July–Oct 2025**
Shift to **Paliperidone LAI** (long-acting injection).
- Paliperidone is basically **the same drug as Risperidone**, just longer-lasting.
- Tremors did **not improve**.
- Fast-acting injections triggered **severe shaking attacks**.
- She again tried to stop eating and forced husband to follow.
- Trust in doctor broke down completely.

### **N. Oct–Nov 2025**
Returned to earlier doctor.
- Was on very **complicated mixture** (Pacitane up to 8 mg, Betacap, Olanzapine, Aripiprazole, Nexito).
- Simplified to fewer medicines.
- But behaviour began **drifting back** to the dangerous 2024 pattern:
  - isolation,
  - controlling husband,
  - refusing food groups,
  - refusing to leave house.
- Tremors still there but less intense than May 2025.

# **What this entire timeline shows clearly**

**Olanzapine → repeatedly stabilizes her.**
**Stopping it → repeatedly destabilizes her.**
**Risperidone + Paliperidone → severe tremors and worsening behaviour.**

This pattern is consistent and unmistakable.

# **2. What Each Medication Really Does — Explained Simply**

People often imagine psychiatric medicines as mysterious. They are not.
Each has a “style” or “personality.”

### **Olanzapine (Oleanz / Olimet / Tolaz DT)**
- Think of it as a **strong calming and stabilizing agent**.
- Helps rigid beliefs soften, reduces fearfulness, reduces irritability.
- Side-effects: sleepiness, weight gain.
- **Low likelihood of causing severe tremors.**
This is why she repeatedly improves with it.

---

### **Risperidone**
- Strong “control” medicine — it grabs the brain’s movement centers tightly.
- Helps some people’s psychosis but often causes:
  - tremors,
  - restlessness,
  - stiffness,
  - shaking.
- Suparna reacted **strongly negatively** to it.

---

### **Paliperidone LAI (Palaris)**
- It is **chemically Risperidone’s active form**.
- Works the same way but lasts a month.
- If someone gets tremors on Risperidone, they often get **more** on Paliperidone.
This matches her experience exactly.

---

### **Aripiprazole (Arip / Asprito)**
- Gentle, light, modern medicine.
- Helps boost engagement and reduce irritability.
- Rarely causes severe tremors by itself, but can cause agitation/restlessness.
- As an add-on to Olanzapine it helped somewhat.

---

### **Pacitane (Trihexyphenidyl)**
- A “tremor-reducing” medicine meant for **certain** kinds of drug-induced stiffness (Parkinson-like effects).
- Helps **some** types of tremor but can **worsen** other kinds (especially tardive movements).
- High doses can cause confusion or memory issues.
Suparna was given **very high doses**, which is not ideal long-term.

---

### **Betacap (Propranolol)**
- Helps if the shaking is due to **internal restlessness or adrenaline**.
- Not useful for all tremors.
- It was added late but didn’t solve the problem.

---

### **Nexito (Escitalopram)**
- An antidepressant.
- Helps anxiety somewhat.
- Does **not** treat delusions.
- Can itself cause tremors in some people (though usually mild).

---

### **Fast-acting injections**
Most likely **Haloperidol**, a very old, very strong drug.
- This is known to trigger **sudden severe shaking** in sensitive people.
- Her reaction is classic for this.

---

# **3. Why She Has Tremors — A Plain Explanation**

There are two major possibilities for tremors caused by psychiatric medicines:

### **(A) Drug-Induced Parkinsonism**
- Happens when a medicine blocks movement circuits too strongly.
- Causes **shaking, stiffness, slowed movement**.
- Appears **weeks after dose changes**.
- Improves when the medicine is reduced or stopped.

### **(B) Tardive Movements**
- Happens after **months or years** of exposure.
- Movements can be jerky, twisting, repetitive.
- **Do NOT improve with Pacitane** (and Pacitane can make them worse).
- Sometimes remain even after stopping the medicine.

### **Which one does Suparna have?**

Based on the timeline:

- Tremors **exploded** only after **Risperidone and Paliperidone**.
- Tremors **reduced** after a **7-day washout**.
- Tremors got **worse** after injections.
- Pacitane only helped a little.
- Movements did **not** disappear fully even after stopping the offending drugs.

This means:

### **She most likely has a mix of:**
- **Drug-Induced Parkinsonism** (main part)
**plus possibly**
- **a Tardive component** (the part that did not fully go away)

That is exactly what her pattern suggests:
**A strong reaction to heavy dopamine-blocking medicines (Risperidone/Paliperidone).**

---

# **4. What Went Wrong in Her Care Journey**

Here we stay neutral and respectful, but we must name patterns clearly.

### **A. Too many abrupt changes**
- Stopping Olanzapine suddenly.
- Starting Risperidone and rapidly increasing.
- Removing Aripiprazole quickly.
- Replacing everything with Paliperidone LAI without first stabilizing her.

A brain as sensitive as Suparna’s **cannot tolerate sudden switches**.

---

### **B. Tremors were not tracked with proper tools**
In movement disorders, doctors must use structured scales (AIMS, SAS, BARS). There is **no evidence these were used**.

---

### **C. The long-acting injection was continued despite clear signs of harm**
Paliperidone LAI locks the medication into the body for a month at a time. If side effects appear, you cannot “pull it out.”
She was kept on it even though:
- tremors worsened,
- behaviour worsened,
- injections triggered severe shaking.

This destroyed trust.

---

### **D. Family’s concerns about bias toward a particular clinic**
I will not judge motives, but I *can* acknowledge that:
- The family experienced behaviour that felt like conflict-of-interest.
- Her refusals to stop or change certain medications felt dismissive.
Trust eroded deeply.

# **5. A Clear, Practical Plan Going Forward (Educational, Not Prescriptions)**

### **Goal:**
- Reduce tremors.
- Reduce delusions.
- Restore predictable functioning.
- Use the fewest medicines possible.

---

## **Step 1 — Identify the exact type of tremor (crucial).**
Use three simple rating scales at every visit:
- **SAS** → stiffness & parkinson-like shaking
- **BARS** → inner restlessness
- **AIMS** → tardive movements

This prevents guesswork and protects her from wrong treatments.

---

## **Step 2 — Return to a single antipsychotic that has repeatedly worked: Olanzapine**

Olanzapine has shown:
- best behavioural stabilization,
- lowest EPS/tremor impact in her case,
- best tolerance historically.

The dose should be **the lowest effective**, but **not too low**, because too-low doses cause relapse.

---

## **Step 3 — Remove or Reduce Tremor-Causing Medicines**

**Stop  → Risperidone, Paliperidone, and all fast-acting injections.**
Her body is too sensitive to them.
(This is not a prescription—just clear pattern recognition.)

---

## **Step 4 — If tremors remain after simplifying meds**

### **If mostly Parkinson-like:**
- Use Pacitane only short-term, then taper.
- Use small-dose Propranolol if needed.

### **If tardive movements confirmed:**
- **VMAT2 inhibitors (like Valbenazine)** are the evidence-based treatment.
- Pacitane should NOT be used (it can worsen tardive movements).

---

## **Step 5 — Long-term definitive treatment: Clozapine**

Clozapine is the **gold standard** for people who:
- do not respond fully to other antipsychotics, **and**
- develop movement problems with typical medicines.

Why Clozapine fits Suparna:
- It has **lowest tremor risk**.
- Helps people with strong delusions that resist other medicines.
- Reduces aggression and behavioural rigidity.
- Often improves tardive movements.

It requires **regular blood tests** for the first year, but stabilizes many people with her profile.

---

## **Step 6 — Adherence plan (non-covert, respectful, effective)**

- Use **orally-disintegrating tablets (ODT)** so she cannot hide or spit out medicine.
- One family member observes the dose daily.
- Keep the regimen simple:
  **1 antipsychotic + (maybe) 1 movement-aid + 1 antidepressant if needed.**
- No changes unless everyone—family and clinician—understands the reason.

---

## **Step 7 — Safety plan**

If she:
- stops eating,
- forces husband to stop eating,
- becomes violent,
- refuses all medication

→ seek urgent in-person help.
Remote supervision cannot keep her safe in those states.

---

# **Summary You Can Carry in Your Pocket**

- **Olanzapine works for her.**
- **Risperidone and Paliperidone caused the tremors.**
- Tremor type = mostly **drug-induced parkinsonism**, maybe some **tardive** component.
- Too many sudden medication changes made things worse.
- Long-acting injectables that are too “strong” for her system broke trust.
- She needs **simple, stable, long-term care**, not frequent switches.
- **Clozapine** is the long-term solution most aligned with her pattern.
- Movement scales must guide every decision.
- Family supervision and a stable, respectful care plan are essential.

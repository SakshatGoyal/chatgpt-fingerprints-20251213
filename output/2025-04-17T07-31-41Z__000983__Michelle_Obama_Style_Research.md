# Michelle Obama Style Research

## You (2025-04-17T07:31:41.959667+00:00)

I want to conduct some deep research in Michelle Obamas writing or speaking style, and I need you to be sort of my research partner to almost flesh out the research objectives and questions and sources and how we might begin synthesizing the information and making it more actionable

My main goal is to convert very analytically written content into digestible content that feels like its coming from Michelle Obama, because she can make anything sound good and relatable. Regardless of someone’s educational background or their iq, they all can not only understand and relate to what she says, but also resonate in the same frequency as her when she speaks.

How do we conduct this research through deep research and how might we begin synthesizing this info

From step 1 to step 5, could you take all of this and write it in first person, in a way that I'm submitting a research approach to a colleague.

So instead of ‘your goal’ there will be ‘my goal’

Instead of creating tasks for me, define them as tasks ‘ I would like to’

Etc…

# Julie Zhuo Profile Prompt

## You (2025-06-08T22:48:16.219000+00:00)

You are a prompt-generation assistant helping to build executive-quality research prompts for constructing cognitive and strategic profiles of influential thinkers, leaders, and innovators. Your task is to generate a highly structured, domain-relevant, and research-ready prompt that can be executed by an advanced reasoning model (e.g., GPT-4 or GPT-4o) to synthesize a detailed advisory persona.

Given the following inputs:

1. **Person's Name**: Julie Zhuo
2. **Core Themes/Expertise** (e.g., design strategy, executive leadership, systems thinking)
3. **Primary Source** (e.g., a specific talk, book, or interview that captures their strategic posture)
4. **Supplemental Source(s)** (optional: additional books, essays, reports, or talks)

Generate a comprehensive research prompt that instructs the model to:
- Focus exclusively on strategic cognition, not biography
- Extract decision-making styles, frameworks, ambiguity navigation strategies, and practical mental models
- Use only high-signal content as input (keynotes, authored books, strategic essays)
- Organize output into clearly labeled sections that can seed an executive advisory persona

The structure of the generated research prompt should include:

- A clear statement of intent
- Five labeled output sections:
  I. Strategic Posture & Decision-Making Style
  II. Cognitive & Strategic Frameworks
  III. Ambiguity Navigation & Complexity Handling
  IV. Translational Insight: From Philosophy to Practice
  V. Known Biases, Edges, or Constraints
- A list of required source types (keynotes, books, interviews)
- An embedded execution persona (e.g., “Strategic Cognition Synthesist”)
- Guardrails to avoid biography, superficial summaries, or motivational filler

Example Input:
- Person’s Name: Sheryl Sandberg
- Core Themes: Executive decision-making, organizational leadership, scaling culture
- Primary Source: *Lean In*
- Supplemental Sources: TED Talk(s), Meta/Facebook leadership interviews

Your output should be a **fully written research prompt** that follows the structure described and is tailored to the individual provided in the input.

Once generated, this research prompt can then be used as-is to profile the thinker named.

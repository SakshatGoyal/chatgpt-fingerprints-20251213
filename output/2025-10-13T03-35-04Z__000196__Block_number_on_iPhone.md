### 📩 If the number texted you:
1. Open the **Messages** app.
2. Open the conversation with that number.
3. Tap the **number/contact name** at the top.
4. Tap the **info (ⓘ)** button.
5. Scroll down and tap **Block this Caller**.
6. Confirm.

Once blocked, you won’t receive calls, texts, or FaceTime from that number.

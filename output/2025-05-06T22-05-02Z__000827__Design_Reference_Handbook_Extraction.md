# Design Reference Handbook Extraction

## You (2025-05-06T22:05:02.358000+00:00)

Extract and synthesize all design-relevant information from the provided transcript and supporting slides to construct an **encyclopedic-style reference guide**. This guide should capture the complete conceptual landscape—terminology, logic, features, data, mechanics, and implied flows—*as discussed*, without introducing external interpretation or speculation. The intended audience is a designer or prototyper who will begin work based on this document alone.

---

#### **Return Format**

Structure the output as a **reference handbook**, with no stakeholder attribution. Use neutral, reusable language. Organize into the following sections:

1. **Terminology & Constructs**

   * Definitions of any terms, labels, or categories used in the transcript (e.g., “entity,” “status logic,” “template type”).
   * Where definitions are implicit, extract the clearest available phrasing and include a note on its usage.

2. **Feature Descriptions & Functional Concepts**

   * For each discrete feature, behavior, or flow discussed, describe what it is, what it’s meant to enable, and any conditions or variations mentioned.
   * Include sequence logic if applicable (e.g., “first the user selects X, then Y becomes available”).

3. **Data, Content, and Inputs**

   * Extract all information about data sources, content types, input structures, or user-provided information referenced in the conversation.
   * Clarify any relationships or dependencies discussed.

4. **Design-Relevant Implications**

   * Identify and articulate any interaction constraints, UI dependencies, or visualization considerations implied by the information discussed.

5. **Conceptual Models (Optional)**

   * If there are visual or verbal metaphors, models, or scaffolds (e.g., frameworks shown in slides), translate those into text form, maintaining the same conceptual relationships.

6. **Ambiguities & Follow-Up Needs**

   * Clearly flag anything that was referenced but not fully defined, or any decision point that remains open, **without speculating**.

---

#### **Warnings & Guardrails**

* **Do not summarize or compress**—instead, extract and organize with clarity and completeness.
* **Do not add assumptions or outside definitions.** If something is unclear, include it in “Ambiguities.”
* If you encounter references from the slides, integrate only what can be cross-validated or clearly inferred from the transcript.

---

#### **Execution Persona**

Act as a **design reference curator**, tasked with creating a fully self-contained design handbook, using only the original transcript and slide materials. You are responsible for making the information actionable *without losing any of its complexity or nuance*.

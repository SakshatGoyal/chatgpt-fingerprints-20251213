# AI Leadership Event Analysis

## You (2024-12-17T13:04:58.077734+00:00)

Hey, I want to tell a compelling story about my research on an event hosted by the D^3 institute at Harvard business school. This event was on AI and Leadership. Of the 1200 people who attended, we'd sent out surveys and abt 200 replied to those surveys.


Based on the responses, I tried to create some groups.  Here's some data from my survey analysis


1. Critical Thinking and Practical Knowledge group

Criteria for selection:
The participants spoke about appreciating practical insights from credible presenters and panelists and (and/or) wanted more case studies and valuable insights. While listening in on the discussions, they wanted some way to ask questions. They also had strong opinions on what they felt were ‘buzzwords’ or ‘sales pitches,’ possibly because they expected actionable insights.

| Nature of the comment | Comment                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Appreciated           | Experienced Insights (panelists or presenters speakign from real life experience and examples)   |
| Would change          | Audience Engagement (live or digital Q&A)                                                        |
| Would change          | More Practical content (case studies, real life examples, technical execution, specific sectors) |
| Would change          | ‘Shallow’ presentations / Sales Pitch (mention of buzz words, platitudes, sales pitches)         |


- This group contains a total of 82 invitees. 80% of them have a background in business and have an even split between having and not having a tech background.
- Nearly half appreciated the 1-day format, with a tiny portion hoping for a 2-day event.
- Only a few of these people seemed concerned about connecting with peers, engaging in breakout sessions, or other social aspects of the event (according to their comments).


2.
Exposure to New Ideas and Trends from Credible Experts

Criteria for selection:
This group spoke highly about the broad range of concepts discussed within a single event, along with the caliber and credibility of the speakers and panelists.

| Nature of the comment | Comment                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Appreciated           | Variety and Quality of content (breadth of content) |
| Appreciated           | Engaging Speakers and Panelists                     |


- This group contains a total of 74 invitees, with 76% of them having a background in business.
- Over half of them appreciated how well the event was organized and executed in a single day.
- Their comments about what they might change indicate that while they appreciated the content and the presenters, there was still a hunger for depth and practical examples.
- A tiny portion of this group commented on networking, engaging with peers, and participating in interactive sessions.
- 3 of 6 people who requested a content primer belong to this category.
- 7 of 15 people critiqued the content as being ‘shallow’ or appearing as a sales pitch belonging to this group, indicating that while people appreciated some of the content, they also had a strong opposing view.

3.
Group thinking, peer engagement, and networking

Criteria for selection:
This group highly appreciated (and/or) wanted to improve the interactive sessions with other attendees and panelists, and ways to engage with their peers and other attendees.

| Nature of the comment | Comment                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Appreciated           | Breakout Sessions                                                                     |
| Would change          | More Breakout sessions (have more sessions, or replace a presentation with a session) |
| Would change          | Better Breakout Sessions (smaller groups, longer duration, etc)                       |
| Appreciated           | Opportunity to connect with people                                                    |
| Would change          | Opportunity to connect with other others                                              |


- This group contains a total of 68 invitees.
- Nearly half of this cohort believe the event was well organized and appreciated how it was executed in a single day.


4.
Logistics, Planning, Enablement

Criteria for selection:
This group of people had comments focused around the conference schedule, format, logistics, and had suggestions on how it could be planned.

| Nature of the comment | Comment                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Appreciated           | Well Organized (logistics, planning, location, enablement)   |
| Would change          | Making the event longer (dedicating time)                    |
| Would change          | Introduce a Primer                                           |
| Would change          | More breaks (ability to pause, process the absorbed content) |


- A total of 103 invitees had comments on this topic.
- 6 people requested some form of precursor to the conference, either in the form of introductions or a 101 on AI concepts being discussed.
- The high number of people appreciating how well the event was organized leads to an even distribution of people liking and disliking other aspects of the event. Due to this, while it may appear challenging to extract any insights from this group, it's also possible to get a wide range of opinions.


------
After seeing the survey, we tried to recruit a few participants and tried to understand the following

- their approach to networking at this event, and other events
- their approach to learning about AI, and addressing any ambiguities from the content.
- how they may stay engaged with the event if they weren't able to attend it.


Here's some rough info about the participants from my user interviews.

we interviewed 11 participants. Out of which

2 were investors with a strong tech background
2 were business owner who were very excited by everything they saw at the event on AI
2 were engineers who didn't find the event valuable from a knowledge standpoint per se, but they were very interested to have an understanding of how business execs and teams look at AI,
2 were mentors who critiqued the facgts that the event was not very actionable for small business owners
2 were professors who were interested in learning new topics, but both their takeaway was that AI will be replacing a lot of entry level jobs which will be bad for students now, and bad for companies some years down the line.
1 had a background in tech but was moving into investment
1 was a digital strategist with a particular interest in AI governance and ethics. She was also someone who was very interested in forming networks and building communities.

Here're my observations from the user interviews. I’m breaking down our observations into three spaces.


- Interviewee's opinion on content and presenters
- Interviewee's approach to networking
- Interviewee’s approach to self-education and problem-solving.
Content and Panelists
Content:
- None of the participants we interviewed joined the D^3ed conference with a specific agenda that is centered around the implementation and applications of AI within organizations.
- Some participants who were well versed in AI did state their desire to understand how leaders from different companies view the impact of AI.
- From the POV of experts in AI, the content fell into a balanced middle ground, where it was neither too technical nor too speculative or forward-thinking.
- From the POV of participants not too deep in AI, the conference acted as an introduction to the possibilities of AI, after which they wanted to learn more about applications of AI within their domain.

Interviewees expected the event to be a source of inspiration to either learn about a broad range of AI application. The sentiment was shared by both experts and novices in the field of AI. Given that some wanted variety, and others wanted depth, the event can be seen as a neutral middle ground, allowing attendees to choose their own path moving forward.


Panelists and Presenters:
- AI professionals mentioned a desire to talk to presenters; however, they expressed discomfort because they saw the presenters as celebrities.
- Participants who focus on mentoring startups felt that insights from representatives of large enterprises offered very little actionable information for small businesses.
- Investors with a strong technical background who diligently followed new research in AI had a neutral opinion of the presenters.
- Every participant mentioned Ethan Mollick’s presentation to be the most valuable for their time.


Staying engaged with missed content:
- Not being able to attend a presentation or workshop was seen as a missed opportunity, but given the wealth of content available today, the missed opportunity was not seen as worth pursuing once again.
- Some participants saw value in staying engaged with a forum (or get different attendees’ take) about missed presentations or workshops.


Approach to Networking
- While networking was mentioned as one of the objectives for attending the event, the general sentiment appeared to be relaxed and casual, where making connections was welcomed but not actively pursued with urgency or intensity.
- Whether the lack of networking was due to a lack of opportunity to network, or due to a rather wide variety of people (leaving attendees with few options to meet people with similar backgrounds) cannot be clearly determined from the interviews alone.
- Most participants believed that domain-specific events are more fruitful for pursuing professional relationships.


Self Education and Problem Solving
- The most common theme among participants was the emergence of ChatGPT as the initial source of addressing ambiguities and learning new concepts.
- Investors with advanced knowledge of AI mentioned subscribing to research papers to learn about new trends and advancements.
- Business Owners and investors wanted to talk to trusted experts within their circle for more information.
- 1 person mentioned learning about AI through books.

----------------------


Despite the challenging observations, I tried to find some opportunities. First, I'd like you to take a look at these two graphics I've attached in a single file.

The upper half represents how we see individual journeys sort of starting out on their own and then eventually diverging out into different paths. The lower half represents what we hope to achieve, with individual pathways organically intersecting with one another, possibly with some AI agents' assistance.

Here're the opportunities I identified:

1. Creating networking experiences that don’t feel transactional or professional in the traditional sense.

For Example

Perspective Pairing Spaces:
Where Illyza and Stacy could connect via their shared perspective on entry level job hiring.

Unconference Spaces:
Where Kelly and Monique could connect on their shared critique on presenters and panelists, and possibly help each other.

Contrasting Viewpoints:
Where Nami can discover people in the pursuit of finding different perspectives on the same topic.


2. Encourage collaborative recap discussions or peer driven analysis. This could work with a combination of bite-sized summaries, opinions, peer commentary, or opportunities for asynchronous discussions.

3. Pre-event networking activities could potentially build anticipation and take some of the pressure away from the event schedule. Today, this happens through slack channels and shared docs that have attendee details.

4. Help by providing clearer “choose-your-own-path” in the form of discussions, tailored courses, and specific articles and references.

Could you give me a few different ways I could combine all my activities into a single story that would be less than 10 minutes? I don't want the script right now, But I'd like you to imagine that you are presenting it to the Director and other business executives who run the organization. Just for your context, our goal is to find ways to improve event experiences, and one way is to make the event more engaging, continuing the engagement pre and post event. While I don't want to explicitly mention that, I do want you to know your audience before giving different approaches to storytelling.

## ChatGPT (2024-12-17T13:06:32.222600+00:00)

Here are **three storytelling approaches** that effectively synthesize your research, analysis, and opportunities into a cohesive 10-minute presentation. Each approach prioritizes clarity, audience engagement, and actionable insights tailored to a leadership audience (e.g., the Director and executives). The approaches differ in structure and framing but lead to the same goal: **improving event experiences through intentional engagement pre, during, and post-event.**

---

### 1. **The Journey Framework: From Fragmented to Interconnected Experiences**

**Narrative Structure:**
Use the two graphics as a storytelling device to frame the entire presentation.
1. **Set the Scene: The Current Attendee Journey (Top Graphic)**
   - Start by presenting the upper half of the graphic and describe the fragmented attendee experience: "Our attendees arrive with their own agendas—some seek knowledge, others want networking, and many are looking for inspiration. Yet, post-event, these journeys scatter, lacking opportunities to meaningfully intersect."
   - Highlight key challenges from your survey and interviews:
     - **Content**: Balance between variety and depth.
     - **Networking**: Casual but unstructured connections.
     - **Engagement**: Missed opportunities before and after the event.

2. **Introduce the Vision: Intersections That Matter (Bottom Graphic)**
   - Reveal the lower half of the graphic: "What if we could transform these parallel journeys into moments of natural intersections? By intentionally creating spaces for shared perspectives, meaningful networking, and collaborative learning, we can make the D^3 event a hub of **ongoing engagement and value**."

3. **Bring the Vision to Life: Opportunities**
   Use the opportunities as ‘pillars’ to bridge the gap:
   - **Perspective Pairing Spaces**: "Imagine attendees connecting over shared challenges—Illyza and Stacy, two professors concerned about the future of entry-level jobs, could meet not because they knew each other, but because we facilitated a shared perspective space."
   - **Collaborative Recaps and Peer Analysis**: "Post-event, attendees like Kelly and Monique—who share contrasting critiques—could deepen their understanding through bite-sized summaries, forums, and commentary."
   - **Pre-event Networking**: "With simple pre-event introductions, we ease participants into the event, making it less pressured and more intentional."
   - **‘Choose-Your-Own-Path’ Tools**: "Attendees overwhelmed by variety could receive tailored suggestions—articles, workshops, or connections—that align with their learning goals."

4. **Close with Impact**
   - Bring the graphics back to reinforce the narrative arc: “By shifting from divergence to intersection, we don’t just improve the event—we create pathways for continuous learning, meaningful connections, and deeper value.”

---

### 2. **The Attendee Persona Story: Walking in Their Shoes**

**Narrative Structure:**
Humanize the story by using three distinct attendee personas (based on your user interviews). Each persona illustrates a pain point, followed by a solution opportunity.

1. **Set the Context: Why This Matters**
   - Introduce the idea that every attendee is different but leaves the event seeking **connection, clarity, or continuity**.
   - "From our research, we identified patterns in attendee needs and opportunities to improve their experience."

2. **Three Personas, Three Stories**
   - **Persona 1: Nami, the Digital Strategist (Focus: Networking)**
     - Nami was excited about building her network but found the connections too casual.
     - **Opportunity**: "What if Nami could find others with shared goals—like a community on AI governance—through pre-event pairing or breakout spaces?"
   - **Persona 2: Ethan, the Engineer (Focus: Content and Depth)**
     - Ethan attended to understand the business perspective but left feeling the content was too broad.
     - **Opportunity**: "By providing tailored post-event discussions or pathways for deeper learning, Ethan could get the actionable insights he craved."
   - **Persona 3: Illyza, the Professor (Focus: Collaboration)**
     - Illyza was worried about AI’s impact on students and small businesses but had no structured space to exchange ideas.
     - **Opportunity**: "Unconference-style forums or recap discussions could empower Illyza to collaborate with peers and share actionable solutions."

3. **Reframe the Impact**
   - Show the cumulative effect of solving these challenges: "By designing for Nami, Ethan, and Illyza, we create a better experience for everyone—where connections, clarity, and collaboration intersect."

4. **Close with a Vision**
   - Reinforce the intersection theme: "Our goal is not just to host a one-day event but to create a network of continuous engagement, where participants like Nami, Ethan, and Illyza thrive long after the event concludes."

---

### 3. **From Pain Points to Possibilities: A Data-Driven Narrative**

**Narrative Structure:**
Structure the story around key insights from your surveys and interviews, presenting each insight as a pain point with a clear, actionable solution.

1. **Frame the Problem: A Fragmented Experience**
   - Start with a high-level overview of the survey data: "We received 200 responses, revealing four key attendee needs: practical knowledge, exposure to ideas, peer engagement, and logistics planning. Yet, many participants shared concerns about engagement, depth, and missed opportunities."

2. **Uncover Pain Points and Solutions (Data + Stories)**
   For each key group from your analysis:
   - **Pain Point 1: Practical Knowledge**
     - "82 participants sought actionable insights and deeper engagement but were disappointed by buzzwords or shallow presentations."
     - **Solution**: "AI agents or tools could enable real-time Q&A, deeper case studies, or post-event collaborative recaps."
   - **Pain Point 2: Exposure to New Ideas**
     - "74 attendees appreciated the content breadth but craved more depth."
     - **Solution**: "Personalized learning paths—specific articles, tailored discussions, or recommended breakout sessions—could meet attendees at their level."
   - **Pain Point 3: Peer Engagement**
     - "68 attendees wanted better opportunities for meaningful connections."
     - **Solution**: "Perspective Pairing and Unconference Spaces could facilitate organic, valuable interactions."
   - **Pain Point 4: Logistics and Planning**
     - "103 participants valued organization but suggested primers, more breaks, and extended time."
     - **Solution**: "Pre-event tools, including attendee primers or small-group introductions, could prepare attendees and reduce day-of pressure."

3. **Reframe the Opportunities as a Strategic Shift**
   - Present the solutions as a way to create **intersections**—not just during the event but before and after. Emphasize the role of thoughtful design and AI assistance: "By solving these pain points, we don’t just meet attendee needs—we amplify the event’s value and engagement."

4. **End with a Vision of Success**
   - Return to the graphics as a visual anchor: "Imagine a future where attendees’ journeys intersect naturally—leading to stronger connections, richer insights, and an event that resonates long after it ends."

---

### Final Thoughts
Each approach provides a strong narrative structure:
1. **The Journey Framework** focuses on the graphics and the transformation from divergence to intersection.
2. **The Attendee Persona Story** humanizes the findings through relatable stories.
3. **From Pain Points to Possibilities** emphasizes data-backed insights and solutions.

I recommend choosing the approach that best matches your presentation style:
- Use **Journey Framework** for a high-level strategic vision.
- Use **Attendee Persona** if you want to make it personal and relatable.
- Use **Pain Points to Possibilities** for a clear, data-driven impact.

Each method ensures your audience understands the opportunities to create lasting engagement—before, during, and after the event.

## You (2024-12-17T13:19:05.979722+00:00)

I like these approaches as a designer. That said, these are compelling stories to a designer. So now, I'd like you to find me ways to make a case for increasing engagement with different audiences through the event (some examples are the opportunities I mentioned earlier), and that this increased engagement will give us more data to make informed decisions about a product or service later down the road. I want you to make this case to a council of harvard educated business leaders. Give me a few approaches to storytelling that can utilize that.

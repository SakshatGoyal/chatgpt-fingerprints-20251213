# Presentation guidelines





## You (2025-11-25T21:47:51.201000+00:00)

## Global Instructions for you

**Overall visual direction**

* Use the existing presentation template.
* For **each theme**, create exactly **4 slides** using this pattern:

  1. **Theme Title Slide** — accent background, single large display text. No bullets, no subtext.
  2. **Scenario + Quotes Slide** — split layout:

     * Left side: scenario (short narrative, 1–2 short paragraphs).
     * Right side: quotes (stacked, visually grouped).
  3. **Problem & Why It Matters Slide** — single-column layout:

     * Section header: “Problem”
     * Section header: “Why it matters”
  4. **Design Opportunities Slide** — clear hierarchy:

     * Slide title: “Design opportunities”
     * 3–5 opportunity blocks with a strong visual hierarchy:

       * Short, bold label or sub-heading per opportunity
       * 1–2 lines of explanatory text

**Typographic hierarchy**

* Theme title slides (Slide 1 of each theme):

  * Use **largest display style** in the template (e.g., H1 / Display).
* All other slide titles:

  * Use standard **Title** style (H2).
* Sub-headings like “Scenario”, “Quotes”, “Problem”, “Why it matters”, “Design opportunities”:

  * Use **H3 / subtitle** style.
* Body text:

  * Standard body style.
* Quotes:

  * Use quote styling if available (italics or quote marks), with **speaker name** in smaller or lighter text.

**Color & emphasis**

* Theme title slides:

  * Use **accent background** from the template with white or high-contrast text.
* Scenario/Problem/Design slides:

  * Use default/light background.
  * Use accent color for key words or callouts (e.g., “late risk discovery”, “pipeline hygiene”, etc.).

**Attribution / citations**

* Keep attribution simple in the slides themselves: “– Tim” / “– Speaker 2” / “– Chris”.
* You don’t need to show file IDs; those are only needed in this working environment.

# THEME 1 – Cadence & Insight

### Theme 1 – Slide 1

**Layout:** Accent background, center-aligned single display text.
**Display Text (one line):**

> **Disciplined Cadence, Fragile Insight**

---

### Theme 1 – Slide 2

**Layout:** Two-column.

* Left: “Scenario”
* Right: “Quotes”

**Left side – Scenario text:**

**Scenario**
Tim runs a disciplined operating rhythm. At the start of the year, each rep creates a territory plan that combines numbers on one side and a development plan on the other. Every quarter, he runs an 8-week Monday cadence of account strategic reviews, where reps walk through 5–8 accounts and their attack plans. Later in the week, he blocks time for one-hour forecast and opportunity-plan reviews with each rep, covering both the current and next quarter.

**Right side – Quotes:**

**Quotes**

> “At start of the year, I formulate my territory plan, and each rep has their territory plan as well… a view of what they can see within Salesforce with regards to the numbers… and then the right side is their development plan on how they’re going to bridge the gap, or overachieve.” – Tim

> “We run a weekly cadence over two of the three months of account strategic reviews, where they actually go into each of their individual accounts and they talk about their attack plan… typically on a Monday morning, eight weeks out of the quarter.” – Tim

> “On a Thursday, I book out an hour each of the reps to run through the current quarter and the next quarter… those forecast calls tend to be opportunity plan reviews as well.” – Tim

---

### Theme 1 – Slide 3

**Layout:** Single column, two sections: “Problem” and “Why it matters”.

**Title:**
**The problem & why it matters**

**Body:**

**Problem**
The cadence is strong, but it lives in people’s calendars and heads, not in the system. The tooling does not adapt to where they are in the quarter or to the purpose of a given session (territory review vs opportunity review vs forecast). Managers must manually reconstruct the same narrative every week by pulling together plans, activities, and opportunities from multiple places.

**Why it matters**

* Time is spent **building the story**, not acting on it.
* The value of a robust cadence is diluted because nothing in the product makes it easier to run those rituals.
* Strategic reviews risk becoming repetitive “status meetings” instead of decision-making forums.

---

### Theme 1 – Slide 4

**Layout:** “Design opportunities” with 3–4 clear blocks, each with bold label + 1–2 lines.

**Title:**
**Design opportunities**

**Body:**

**Cadence-aware views**
Create views that change emphasis based on quarter stage (e.g., 8 weeks out vs 2 weeks out) and meeting type (territory review vs forecast), surfacing only the most relevant accounts and metrics.

**Monday review pack**
Auto-assemble a Monday “review pack” for each manager: key accounts, plan updates, new risks, and where to focus time this week.

**Embedded review templates**
Provide reusable templates for territory reviews and opportunity-plan reviews so managers don’t rebuild the same structure every quarter.

**Plan freshness indicators**
Add visual freshness indicators for territory and account plans so it’s obvious which ones are up to date for the current cadence.

---

# THEME 2 – Pipeline Risk & Hygiene

### Theme 2 – Slide 1

**Layout:** Accent background, single display text.

**Display Text:**

> **When Hygiene Fails, Pipeline Collapses**

---

### Theme 2 – Slide 2

**Layout:** Two-column – Scenario vs Quotes.

**Left side – Scenario:**

**Scenario**
In a quarterly pipeline review, Tim inspects several large opportunities that have been sitting in future quarters. He notices that some of them haven’t had their opportunity plans updated for months. When he asks the rep, they admit these deals are unlikely to land this financial year. As Tim digs further, he realizes this isn’t an isolated case—multiple opportunities share the same hygiene problem, and suddenly a third of his apparent pipeline disappears.

**Right side – Quotes:**

**Quotes**

> “For me… the ones that are in the financial year or four quarters ahead that have got gaps in the opportunity plans, or just haven’t been updated for a long time… that’s what I’d be looking at.” – Tim

> “Sometimes there’ll be a deal that’s out in June for a million dollars, and there’s no opportunity plan… an opportunity plan in June that hasn’t been updated in three months.” – Tim

> “When I talk to the rep, he goes, ‘Yeah, probably isn’t in this financial year’… and then he says that about three other opportunities, and all of a sudden, a third of my pipe is gone down.” – Tim

---

### Theme 2 – Slide 3

**Title:**
**The problem & why it matters**

**Body:**

**Problem**
Opportunity-plan hygiene is a leading indicator of deal quality, but it’s not treated that way in the system. Stale or missing plans can sit unnoticed for months. Risk is discovered only when a manager happens to inspect the right opportunity and ask the right questions.

**Why it matters**

* Forecast accuracy is undermined by **hidden fragility** in the pipeline.
* Managers experience painful “haircut moments” where a meaningful portion of pipeline instantly evaporates.
* Coaching becomes reactive and crisis-driven rather than systematic and early.

---

### Theme 2 – Slide 4

**Title:**
**Design opportunities**

**Body:**

**Hygiene-based risk flags**
Automatically flag opportunities with missing or outdated plans, incomplete MEDDIC fields, or long periods of inactivity.

**Pipeline “haircut” simulator**
Let managers simulate, “What if all red-flagged deals slipped or dropped?” to see coverage and forecast impact before it happens.

**Hygiene dashboards**
Offer a dedicated view that focuses on **trustworthiness** of pipeline (plan freshness, completeness, recent updates) rather than just its size.

**Guided plan refreshes**
Use AI to suggest plan updates based on emails, meeting notes, and recent activity, reducing the admin cost of keeping plans current.

---

# THEME 3 – Forecast vs Pipeline vs Coaching

### Theme 3 – Slide 1

**Layout:** Accent background.

**Display Text:**

> **One View, Three Mental Models: Forecast, Pipeline, Coaching**

---

### Theme 3 – Slide 2

**Layout:** Scenario vs Quotes.

**Left side – Scenario:**

**Scenario**
A proposed dashboard mixes everything—quarter-to-date closed and commit, coverage metrics, pipeline health, and territory performance signals—all in one frame. On first glance it feels powerful. But as managers try to use it, they realize it’s blending forecast constructs (“what will close this quarter?”) with pipeline constructs (“do we have enough for future quarters?”) and elements of territory diagnostics.

**Right side – Quotes:**

**Quotes**

> “For me, what I’m missing is… you are centralizing things in one single place… but at the moment, everything is combined. So for me, it’s confusing.” – Speaker 2

> “You are mixing pipeline and forecast. That’s confusing. You should have one thing that is pipeline… and one that is forecast.” – Speaker 2

> “If I prepare for a pipeline review meeting, I will go to my tab that says pipeline… If I prepare for a forecast call, I will go to my forecast tab.” – Speaker 2

---

### Theme 3 – Slide 3

**Title:**
**The problem & why it matters**

**Body:**

**Problem**
The view blends different mental models—forecast, pipeline building, and coaching—into a single canvas. Forecast is about **“what will close this quarter?”**; pipeline is about **“do we have enough, early enough?”**; coaching is about **“is this rep doing the right things?”** When all three are mixed, the job-to-be-done of the page becomes ambiguous.

**Why it matters**

* Managers are forced to interpret **what the page is trying to be** before they can use it.
* No single motion (forecast, pipeline, or coaching) is fully supported end-to-end.
* The cognitive load is high, and the risk of misreading signals increases.
* The same view cannot easily be used to prepare a forecast call, a pipeline review, and a 1:1 coaching conversation.

---

### Theme 3 – Slide 4

**Title:**
**Design opportunities**

**Body:**

**Motion-specific modes**
Create discrete modes for Forecast, Pipeline, and Coaching, each tuned to a specific question and workflow.

**Meeting presets**
Offer ready-made presets: “Forecast call,” “Pipeline review,” “1:1 coaching,” each with pre-selected metrics, filters, and layouts.

**Single-question framing**
Start each mode with a clear question:

* Forecast: *Are we going to hit the number?*
* Pipeline: *Do we have enough, and is it moving?*
* Coaching: *Is this rep doing the right things in the right way?*

**Mode-specific AI**
Layer AI that is context-aware: in Forecast mode, highlight deals likely to slip; in Pipeline mode, highlight gaps in future coverage; in Coaching mode, surface reps who need targeted support.

---

# THEME 4 – Rep Development & Multi-Signal Judgment

### Theme 4 – Slide 1

**Layout:** Accent background.

**Display Text:**

> **Rep Performance Is More Than a Number**

---

### Theme 4 – Slide 2

**Layout:** Scenario vs Quotes.

**Left side – Scenario:**

**Scenario**
Tim doesn’t judge reps solely by attainment. When someone is behind, he looks at their pipeline, learning center progress, meeting activity, and executive outreach. If a rep is doing the right things—building pipeline, attending trainings, running meetings—he advocates patience and coaching. If a rep is missing both numbers and behaviors, that’s a very different conversation.

**Right side – Quotes:**

**Quotes**

> “We spent 12 years as a rep here… I can see how many courses the rep has got to do… but being able to qualify: what are the ones that he has to do? I have to do my flight training on Cortex XDR… has he done that? Because that’s a flag for sure.” – Tim

> “If the reps aren’t doing very well against their number, the next thing we look at is their pipeline, their learning, their meetings, their activities…” – Tim

> “If they’re doing all of those… then we’ll be patient… this is an individual we want to keep in the team. Equally, if it’s a rep who isn’t doing his number and he’s not doing any of the below, then he’s obviously one step out of the business.” – Tim

---

### Theme 4 – Slide 3

**Title:**
**The problem & why it matters**

**Body:**

**Problem**
The signals that matter for rep development—pipeline health, learning compliance, meeting volume and quality, executive outreach—are scattered across systems. Managers must manually piece these together to make judgment calls about whether someone needs coaching, more time, or escalation.

**Why it matters**

* Performance decisions become inconsistent between managers.
* High-potential reps may be cut too early; low-engagement reps may linger.
* It’s hard to explain or defend decisions up the chain without a coherent view.
* Coaching time is not always directed where it will have the greatest impact.

---

### Theme 4 – Slide 4

**Title:**
**Design opportunities**

**Body:**

**Rep health cards**
Provide a single view per rep showing attainment, pipeline coverage, learning progress, activity levels, and executive engagement.

**Behavior-weighted performance signals**
Summarize behavior + outcome into a simple signal that helps distinguish “doing the right things, outcomes will follow” from “not doing the right things, outcomes unlikely to improve.”

**AI-generated 1:1 agendas**
Generate suggested talking points for weekly 1:1s based on recent changes in pipeline, activity, and enablement.

**Enablement priority flags**
Highlight the specific trainings or competencies that are most urgent for each rep given their deals and product mix.

# THEME 5 – Product Coverage as a Growth Engine

### Theme 5 – Slide 1

**Layout:** Accent background.

**Display Text:**

> **Selling the Full Truck, Not Just One Box**

---

### Theme 5 – Slide 2

**Layout:** Scenario vs Quotes.

**Left side – Scenario:**

**Scenario**
Tim describes a simple but powerful ritual: for each key account, the AE and Solutions Consultant run through a checklist of products and decide the next step—introduce, progress, or close out. This diligence helped him unlock a 200K deal in a previously locked-out account simply by persisting with one product line and having a clear next step.

**Right side – Quotes:**

**Quotes**

> “That is a checklist that an AE could run through once a week with his Solutions Consultant… what is the one-liner next step? Prisma, res, what am I going to do? What is my next step?” – Tim

> “Once the rep has initially filled it out, then it’s a case of just updating it… rather than ‘they’ve got GlobalProtect, how are we going to get them to Prisma Access?’… I’m talking about: they’ve got eight accounts. How are we going to sell everything in the truck?” – Tim

> “We were locked out… but I kept plugging away at Unit 42… we closed 200 grand… just being diligent about making sure that we have a plan on every single product to sell into that customer.” – Tim

---

### Theme 5 – Slide 3

**Title:**
**The problem & why it matters**

**Body:**

**Problem**
Product coverage—the extent to which each product is introduced and progressed in each key account—is not systematically tracked or visualized. It relies on individual diligence and offline checklists.

**Why it matters**

* Cross-sell and platform opportunities can be easily missed.
* Leadership has limited visibility into where the portfolio is under-represented.
* Enablement teams can’t precisely target where product knowledge or messaging is weak.
* It’s harder to replicate the behaviors of top cross-sellers across the broader team.

---

### Theme 5 – Slide 4

**Title:**
**Design opportunities**

**Body:**

**Product coverage matrix**
Visualize accounts vs products with simple status states (Not introduced / Introduced / In play / Closed-won).

**AE–SC checklist workflows**
Turn the weekly checklist ritual into a structured workflow, capturing next steps and product positioning decisions.

**Portfolio opportunity suggestions**
Use data to surface accounts where additional products are likely to land well based on similar customers or current install base.

**Attach-rate reporting**
Show attach rates by product, segment, and rep, helping leaders identify where additional focus could drive platform growth.

---

# THEME 6 – Executive Engagement & EBCs

### Theme 6 – Slide 1

**Layout:** Accent background.

**Display Text:**

> **Executive Touchpoints as a Strategic Lever**

---

### Theme 6 – Slide 2

**Layout:** Scenario vs Quotes.

**Left side – Scenario:**

**Scenario**
Tim knows that executive outreach and EBCs materially improve close rates. He’s targeting one EBC per rep per quarter and uses Salesforce forms to track C-level meetings and EBC requests. But when preparing a territory review, he must hop across systems and reports to understand whether his team is actually hitting those high-value exec engagement goals.

**Right side – Quotes:**

**Quotes**

> “We have to fill out a form through Salesforce to do an executive outreach. We have to fill out a form to do EBC, C-level meetings.” – Tim

> “I’m targeting myself on seven EBCs a quarter, one per rep… I can log into this and go, right, I’ve got seven people in my team, and I’ve only done two, I need to…” – Tim

> “Ollie was presenting… when an account has an EBC, 80% of the time we close the deal… when an account has ASR, 60% of the time we close the deal… let’s have those metrics, and then we can click into them.” – Tim

---

### Theme 6 – Slide 3

**Title:**
**The problem & why it matters**

**Body:**

**Problem**
Executive engagement is tracked, but not surfaced in a way that managers can quickly use. There’s no single place to see EBCs, executive outreach, and C-level meetings per account or rep, nor to connect them directly to opportunities.

**Why it matters**

* A proven win-rate lever is under-utilized because it is hard to manage and inspect.
* Managers cannot easily see which strategic accounts lack senior coverage.
* Reps may under-request executive support or EBCs because the value isn’t visible.

---

### Theme 6 – Slide 4

**Title:**
**Design opportunities**

**Body:**

**Exec engagement dashboard**
Provide a view showing EBCs, executive outreaches, and C-level meetings by rep and account.

**Impact analytics**
Quantify and visualize how executive engagement correlates with win rate and deal size, reinforcing its importance.

**Gap alerts**
Highlight top accounts with no recent executive touch, nudging managers to plan outreach or EBCs.

**Drill-through from metrics to opps**
Allow managers to click on an engagement metric and see the underlying accounts and opportunities immediately.

---

# THEME 7 – AI as Strategic Co-Pilot

### Theme 7 – Slide 1

**Layout:** Accent background.

**Display Text:**

> **From Highlighting Risk to Guiding Decisions**

---

### Theme 7 – Slide 2

**Layout:** Scenario vs Quotes.

**Left side – Scenario:**

**Scenario**
AI is present in tools like Clari and People.ai, but mostly as a way to surface potential errors or risk in data. It highlights anomalies and benchmarks, but doesn’t yet provide guidance on what to do next. Meanwhile, teams see clear opportunities where AI could help—like keeping account plans updated with the latest company information or suggesting what fields to maintain in Salesforce.

**Right side – Quotes:**

**Quotes**

> “You have a little bit of AI in Clari… the AI is only to highlight potential errors or potential risk, but it’s not giving you suggestions about what to do next.” – Speaker 2

> “They are using AI for account planning… to do research… to summarize meetings, to read notes… but I don’t know how that’s going to be having an impact for DSMs looking into their reports.” – Speaker 2

> “Surely we could just update [account plans] automatically… when the annual report or the quarterly comes out?” – Tim

---

### Theme 7 – Slide 3

**Title:**
**The problem & why it matters**

**Body:**

**Problem**
AI exists at the edges—spotting inconsistencies, summarizing text, helping with research—but it does not yet shape the core managerial workflows: prioritizing accounts, maintaining plans, or deciding where to coach.

**Why it matters**

* AI is perceived as a “nice extra” rather than “how we run the business.”
* The cognitive burden of pattern detection still sits entirely on managers.
* There’s an untapped opportunity to turn raw data into recommended actions that align with existing cadences and motions.

---

### Theme 7 – Slide 4

**Title:**
**Design opportunities**

**Body:**

**Weekly “what changed” briefs**
Have AI generate a digest of meaningful changes in pipeline, accounts, risks, and rep behavior ahead of each cadence meeting.

**Auto-updated plans**
Use AI to ingest public company data, internal signals, and activity logs to keep key fields in account and opportunity plans up to date.

**Pattern detection across territories**
Surface anomalies such as stalled opps, recurring MEDDIC gaps, or systematically under-engaged high-value accounts.

**Coaching intelligence**
Identify reps whose behaviors and outcomes are misaligned and suggest targeted coaching themes for each.

---

# THEME 8 – Productivity

### Theme 8 – Slide 1

**Layout:** Accent background.

**Display Text:**

> **Everyone Feels the Productivity Problem, No One Has the Definition**

---

### Theme 8 – Slide 2

**Layout:** Scenario vs Quotes.

**Left side – Scenario:**

**Scenario**
Leaders are aligned that productivity is a major pain point, especially as they push to reduce admin work and increase customer-facing time. But when they talk about what productivity actually means—whether it’s meetings, emails, learning, or something else—there isn’t a shared definition. Tim emphasizes face-to-face customer interactions, while others reference system centralization and new HR-led competency scoring.

**Right side – Quotes:**

**Quotes**

> “We are very concerned that productivity is definitely one of the pain points… we want to help reduce that burden on admin work that your reps are doing.” – Chris

> “How do we define productivity?… I had the same question for my new hire buddy… how do you define productivity for us?” – Speaker 2

> “Productivity [is] seeing customers, face to face… face to face touch points, emails to customers… although I wouldn’t micromanage them to that point.” – Tim

---

### Theme 8 – Slide 3

**Title:**
**The problem & why it matters**

**Body:**

**Problem**
There is no shared, operational definition of productivity that connects behavior, pipeline creation, and outcomes. Everyone agrees it matters, but different stakeholders emphasize different inputs.

**Why it matters**

* Tools and dashboards risk optimizing for the wrong behaviors (e.g., raw activity volume instead of effective engagement).
* Managers lack a common language to discuss productivity with their teams.
* It’s hard to fairly compare productivity across regions or roles.
* Initiatives aimed at “improving productivity” can end up misaligned and hard to measure.

---

### Theme 8 – Slide 4

**Title:**
**Design opportunities**

**Body:**

**Co-created productivity framework**
Work with Sales Ops, DSMs, and HR to define a small set of measurable components (engagement, pipeline creation, progression, learning, exec outreach).

**Behavioral productivity index**
Introduce a composite score that complements, but does not replace, attainment—grounded in agreed behaviors.

**Productivity vs outcome analytics**
Visualize where strong behaviors aren’t yet translating into results (good coaching bets) versus where both are weak (performance risk).

**Early-warning indicators**
Highlight reps whose productivity patterns are degrading over time before it’s visible in quota attainment.

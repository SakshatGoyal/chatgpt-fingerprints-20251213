Find me at least 5 jiu jitsu youtube channels that are most beneficial for beginners.

Ensure that they not only have content but also the videos have comments from people that indicate that it helped them to get ready for more intermediate and advanced jiu-jitsu.

Also see if the content doesn't just show the drills but the content creator also gets into some of the details and specifics about a drill.

For your context I'm beginning to start getting into jiu-jitsu but I have no prior experience in any form of martial arts. I do have the necessary space and the mat to get started, so now I just need one place I can follow to get started.

| Channel | Why it stands out for brand-new grapplers | Proof of helpful viewer feedback | Watch-this-first video |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Chewjitsu**  <https://www.youtube.com/c/Chewjitsu> | Black-belt coach Nick “Chewy” Albin breaks every drill into tiny body-mechanics cues (“where your toes point, how your hips open,” etc.). Most lessons finish with *how to plug the solo movement into live rolling*, making them ideal once you finally get a partner. | Reddit threads show white- and blue-belts crediting Chewy’s solo-drill clips with giving them “the confidence to start class” and “fixing mistakes that held me back”  | “3 BJJ Solo Drills & How to Use Them During a Match” – <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAXm24mOvSA>  |
| **Jordan Teaches Jiu Jitsu**  <https://www.youtube.com/c/jordanteachesjiujitsu> | Jordan Preisinger’s *Solo-Drill Library* is filmed from multiple angles with slow-motion replays, and every clip ends with the “common mistakes beginners make” section. | A recent Reddit review of his theory course: “his YT drills already took me from clueless white belt to winning my first rolls”  | “The BEST Solo Drills to Improve Your BJJ” – <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeKq9JEYzh0>  |
| **Stephan Kesting / Grapplearts**  <https://www.youtube.com/@stephankesting> | Decades-long educator famous for ultra-clear “do-this-NOT-that” graphics. Many solo-movement videos pair the drill with the exact escape or guard-retention scenario it fixes. | YT snippet shows viewers replying “You definitely have our backs! Thank you.” on a recent solo-movement clip  — and Reddit lists his channel among “resources that saved my beginner months”  | “Home Solo Drills to Improve Your Escapes & Guard Retention” – <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkEWCgfI3rc>  |
| **Knight Jiu Jitsu (Eli Knight)**  <https://www.youtube.com/c/knightjiujitsu> | Eli Knight focuses on functional solo mobility with clear ties to self-defense and sport BJJ.

| **Gracie Breakdown / Gracie University**  <https://www.youtube.com/user/GracieBreakdown> | Rener & Ryron Gracie’s *Combatives 2.0* lessons walk absolute beginners through every micro-detail (base, posture, timing). Their breakdown style shows the drill, then inserts real-fight or sparring footage so you see *why* it matters. | Viewers on classic breakdowns: “This helped me in more than one way when I roll” . Wikipedia lists the channel among the most-watched BJJ resources (700 k + subs, 155 M views)  | “Lesson 1 – Gracie Combatives 2.0 (Beginner BJJ Full Lesson)” – <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvel1sK25QQ>  |

**How to use them**

1. **Pick one primary voice** (Chewy or Jordan are especially beginner-oriented) and follow their solo-movement playlist three times a week on your mat.
2. **Record yourself** doing each drill once a week; compare against the coach’s details to self-correct.
3. **Layer context**: after two weeks per drill, re-watch the coach’s “live application” section so the movement makes sense when you finally train with partners.
4. **Supplement, don’t overwhelm**: use the other channels for a second explanation when something feels awkward—hearing the same idea in a new voice often makes it click.

That single “follow-one-teacher, cross-check-with-others” approach keeps things simple but gives you all the detail (and encouragement) you need to progress smoothly into instructor-led classes. Enjoy the journey, and tap early, tap often!

Could you name some of the solo bjj drills that are taught to someone when they're starting out? Assume the role of a pro bjj trainer

## ChatGPT (2025-05-26T07:59:29.938870+00:00)

Absolutely. When starting your Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu journey, here are several foundational solo drills I teach every beginner. Mastering these early will significantly improve your movement, coordination, and overall jiu-jitsu effectiveness:

### 1. **Shrimping (Hip Escape)**
- **Purpose:** Helps you develop hip mobility and space creation.
- **How to:** Lie on your back, knees bent, feet close to your hips. Push off one foot, extend your hips out to the side, and frame your arms as if pushing an opponent away. Repeat alternating sides.

### 2. **Bridge (Upa)**
- **Purpose:** Teaches explosive hip movement to escape pins and submissions.
- **How to:** Lie flat on your back, knees bent, feet close to your butt. Push through your heels to raise your hips high while turning slightly onto your shoulder.

### 3. **Technical Stand-Up**
- **Purpose:** Teaches safe ways to stand up from the ground defensively.
- **How to:** Sit on the mat, one leg extended, opposite hand on the mat behind you. Lift your hips slightly, pulling your extended leg beneath you into a standing position, keeping your other hand up to defend your face.

### 4. **Sit-Out (Wrestler’s Sit-Out)**
- **Purpose:** Develops hip and shoulder mobility, crucial for escaping turtle or guard passing positions.
- **How to:** Start on all fours, pivot your hips, kicking one leg underneath you as you rotate your chest upward, then return to starting position and switch sides.

### 5. **Granby Roll**
- **Purpose:** Improves your spatial awareness and rolling technique for guard retention.
- **How to:** Start seated, roll sideways over one shoulder smoothly, ending in the same seated position or turtle, then reverse the movement back.

### 6. **Sprawls**
- **Purpose:** Essential for developing reflexive defense against takedown attempts.
- **How to:** From a standing athletic stance, quickly shoot your legs back, drop your hips flat, and extend your arms forward. Quickly recover to stance and repeat.

### 7. **Triangle Setup Drill**
- **Purpose:** Helps build core strength and flexibility while mastering triangle choke mechanics.
- **How to:** Lie on your back, raise your hips, and shoot your legs upwards, crossing ankles in a triangle position, alternate sides.

These drills form the essential movement vocabulary for any beginner grappler. Focus on smooth execution, control, and balance, gradually increasing speed and intensity. They'll set you up for solid success on the mats!

A lot of beginner drills involve rolling on the back. Are there ways for beginners to first strengthen their back or would you say the drills themselves are meant to strengthen someone's back?

## ChatGPT (2025-05-26T08:25:13.714866+00:00)

That's a smart question. In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, beginner solo drills (like shrimping, bridging, or rolling) do indeed build strength and mobility in your back muscles naturally as you practice them consistently.

However, as a professional BJJ trainer, I usually recommend beginners complement these drills with some targeted strength and mobility exercises to prep the back and avoid discomfort, especially if you're not used to this type of movement:

### Simple back-strengthening exercises for beginners:
- **Superman Holds:** Lie face down, simultaneously lift arms and legs off the mat, hold briefly, repeat.
- **Bird-Dog:** From hands and knees position, extend opposite arm and leg simultaneously, hold and repeat alternating sides.
- **Glute Bridges:** Lie on your back, feet planted, lift hips toward the ceiling, hold briefly, then lower slowly.

### Mobility exercises for back health:
- **Cat-Cow stretches:** Gently alternate arching and rounding your back on all fours.
- **Child’s Pose:** Hold a gentle stretch to decompress your lower back muscles.

Doing these exercises (2-3 sets of 10 reps, two or three times per week) alongside your drills helps build foundational strength and mobility. This extra step ensures comfort, helps avoid soreness, and makes your rolling drills feel more controlled.

**Bottom line:**
Drills themselves are beneficial and will help condition your back over time. Still, combining them with basic strengthening and mobility exercises can speed up your body's adjustment and make your early training experience smoother and safer.

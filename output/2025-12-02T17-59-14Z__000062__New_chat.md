I have the following disclaimers but they're not quite easy for a person to understand. these disclaimers appear on the products when they're in a cart.

Here're the 4.

"The Real Estate CE Membership (Plus, Pro, and Premier) is a 12-month auto-renewing subscription for your selected state(s) and profession. Cancel anytime via your account or customer service."

"Membership agreement: 24-month (two-year) commitment required at the time of purchase. At the end of 24 months, your membership will auto-renew for another 24 months (two-year period). You have 30 days to cancel after the initial purchase or auto-renew. If any for-credit course is completed you are no longer eligible for a refund. Memberships canceled before fulfilling your 24-month commitment will be charged the full price."

"Course access is available for 6 months from the date of purchase."

"The Appraisal Foundation has changed its book procurement process for the 2026-2027 USPAP cycle. As a result, if you request a refund for a USPAP course or a package containing a USPAP course, the refund amount will be reduced by the cost of any required USPAP books that were included with your course registration."

I've redesigned the 2nd one like so -

A tag reads 'Auto Renews in 24 months', and whn a user hovers over it, he reads

Your membership requires a 24-month (2-year) commitment. At the end of each term, it will automatically renew for another 24 months unless you cancel.
- You have 30 days to cancel after purchase or renewal.
- If you complete a for-credit course, you are not eligible for a refund.
- Canceling before your 24-month term ends will result in being charged the full price.

I don't know if this is the best and easiest to understand by a common user, But I need you to, in a similar way, create 1 tag and one hover state written description I can use on the tooltip that is easier for a user to quickly understand.

Below are **clear, UX-friendly tag labels and hover descriptions** for all four disclaimers. I’m aiming for the same tone and structure you used in your redesigned #2—plain language, scannable bullets, and no legalese. Each is optimized for “quick grasp” in an attention-constrained cart context.

---

## **1. Real Estate CE Membership (Plus, Pro, Premier)**
**Tag:**
**12-Month Auto-Renewing Membership**

**Hover Description:**
Your membership renews every 12 months for your selected state(s) and profession unless you cancel.
- Cancel anytime from your account or by contacting support.
- Renewal charges occur automatically each year.

---

## **2. 24-Month Membership Commitment**
*(Yours is already strong. Here’s a lightly refined, more user-centric version.)*

**Tag:**
**Auto-Renews Every 24 Months**

**Hover Description:**
This membership has a 24-month (2-year) commitment. It will auto-renew for another 24 months unless you cancel.
- You can cancel within 30 days of purchase or renewal.
- Completing any for-credit course removes eligibility for a refund.
- Canceling before the 24-month term ends will result in a full-price charge.

---

## **3. Course Access Window**
**Tag:**
**6-Month Course Access**

**Hover Description:**
You’ll have access to this course for 6 months from the date of purchase.
- After 6 months, course access expires and you will no longer be able to view or complete the material.

---

## **4. USPAP Book Refund Policy**
**Tag:**
**USPAP Book Refund Notice**

**Hover Description:**
Refunds for USPAP courses or packages may be reduced.
- Required USPAP books must be purchased separately by providers.
- If you request a refund, the cost of those required books will be deducted from the refund amount.

If you’d like, I can also:
- Combine these into a standardized tooltip system
- Adjust tone to be more formal or more conversational
- Propose iconography (e.g., clock, refresh, info) to help visual scanning
- Review the cart layout to ensure cognitive load stays low

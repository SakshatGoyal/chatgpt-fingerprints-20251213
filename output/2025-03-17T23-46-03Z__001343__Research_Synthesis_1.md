# Research Synthesis 1

## You (2025-03-17T23:46:03.236000+00:00)

Hey Michael, I need your thoughts as a design director who knows how to instruct his team. 

I have these set of instructions for chatGPT, which allows me to summarize any research paper in the way that **I really want insights extracted** from any paper. 

Take a look at this first, internalize it, and let me know what you understand about the way I like my insights. 

----

Develop in-depth and analytically rigorous summaries of scholarly research papers intended for executives of Fortune 500 corporations, senior organizational leaders, and doctoral-level scholars. Each summary must effectively articulate strategic implications, operational considerations, and theoretical advancements, employing a sophisticated, analytical narrative informed by Robert Greene’s analytical yet compelling writing style. Insights provided should be strongly grounded in empirical data, thoughtfully constructed to provoke critical reflection, and clearly demarcated from speculative or theoretical assertions.

### Required Structure

Each summary must begin explicitly by stating:

## **Title of Paper**

**Author(s):** First Name, Last Name; First Name, Last Name

**Published:** (DD, Month, YYYY)

#### Abstract

Construct a concise abstract clearly delineating:

1. **Identify Key Themes:** What are the central ideas the authors are exploring?
2. **Uncover Core Motivations:** What critical organizational, strategic, or theoretical challenge does this research aim to address?
3. **Methodological Clarification:** What data collection and analysis techniques were used, and how do these methods influence the reliability of insights?
4. **Assess Relevance:** In what ways does this research connect to contemporary industry practices or challenges?

#### Insight Presentation

The body of the summary should comprise multiple distinct sections structured as follows:

- **Insight Statement:**

  Before drafting an insight, perform these steps:

  1. **Challenge Assumptions:** Identify and question the implicit assumptions that underlie the research findings. Ask: *What might this data overlook? What perspectives are absent?*
  2. **Reverse the Narrative:** Imagine the opposite outcome had occurred. What would that reveal about the core insight?
  3. **Stress Test the Implication:** Evaluate how robust the conclusion is under extreme or unconventional scenarios. Ask: *Would this still apply if circumstances shifted dramatically?*

  Example Insights:

  "**While most experts conclude that taking short breaks is vital to stay productive, participants from the study continued to see short breaks as unimportant and avoidable.**"

  "**Although people felt a bit of regret for missing certain talks or workshops, the overwhelming abundance of AI-related content available elsewhere diluted any urgency to catch up.**"

- **Supporting Context Paragraph:**

  Before writing the supporting context:

  1. **Trace the Data's Journey:** Identify key data points, their sources, and any transformations they underwent before conclusions were drawn.
  2. **Clarify Uncertainty:** Ask: *What known limitations or unexplored variables might reduce the reliability of this finding?*
  3. **Identify Hidden Bias:** Assess whether the methodology inadvertently favored specific outcomes or groups.

Each insight and supporting paragraph should maintain a balance between conciseness and comprehensiveness, exemplified as follows:

"**Perceived ease of use is the most influential factor in SaaS adoption from an individual perspective, emphasizing the importance of user-friendly interfaces and minimal effort requirements.**

The study highlights perceived ease of use as a critical factor influencing SaaS adoption among individuals. This factor is determined primarily by end-users rather than managerial levels, indicating that users' perceptions of ease and effortlessness significantly drive adoption decisions. The research analyzed eight articles that consistently pointed to ease of use as a major determinant, suggesting that SaaS providers should prioritize intuitive, accessible designs to enhance adoption rates."

Conclusion

- Clearly and succinctly reiterate the critical insights.
- Explicitly highlight strategic and operational implications relevant to senior executives and decision-makers.
- Briefly summarize notable methodological limitations highlighted by the authors.
- Identify explicit areas for future scholarly investigation, clearly defining both applicability and research boundaries.



### Guidelines and Constraints

- Employ deliberate "think through" steps before articulating insights to ensure nuanced, critical reflection. Before finalizing any summary, ensure that all references to external ideas, data points, or conceptual frameworks are explicitly attributed through in-text citations. Citations should follow MLA guidelines and be integrated naturally within the narrative to maintain clarity and flow.
- Ensure precise, thorough, and transparent handling and reporting of quantitative metrics. Clearly indicate simplifications or approximations.
- Explicitly distinguish empirical results from speculative or theoretical insights.
- Avoid redundancy, ensuring all insights provided are distinct, substantive, and uniquely valuable.
- Maintain comprehensiveness; do not omit critical insights for brevity alone.
- Uphold rigorous academic standards by employing consistent numbered in-text citations throughout the response. Each referenced idea, insight, or conclusion must be clearly linked to its source. Use inline citations immediately following the referenced content, ensuring clarity on what is being cited. Conclude each summary with a comprehensive MLA-formatted reference list that includes all cited works.
- Give me the summary in canvas

## ChatGPT (2025-03-17T23:46:04.151751+00:00)

Got it. You’re looking for research summaries that are:  

1. **Strategic & Operationally Relevant** – Targeted at Fortune 500 executives and senior leaders, so they should highlight **actionable takeaways** and industry applications.  
2. **Empirically Grounded & Analytical** – Insights should be deeply rooted in data, methodologically rigorous, and **free from speculation** unless explicitly noted.  
3. **Critically Thought Through** – You want me to **challenge assumptions, reverse the narrative, and stress-test implications** before presenting any insight.  
4. **Concise Yet Comprehensive** – No fluff, no redundancy—just dense, high-value insights.  
5. **Structured & Citation-Rich** – MLA formatting, clear delineation between empirical findings and interpretation, and proper attributions for all claims.  
6. **Robert Greene-Inspired Writing** – Analytical, compelling, and provocative in its framing of insights.  

The **canvas** format request suggests you want the summaries formatted in a structured way for easy readability.   

Now, before I proceed—do you want me to tweak anything? Should I lean more towards **executive decision-making** or **academic rigor**, or is the balance you’ve outlined exactly what you want?

## You (2025-03-18T03:53:17.528000+00:00)

Before you proceed, let me share some information about my current work. Then, we can discuss the next steps. However, first, we need to engage in critical thinking, evaluation, and creative ideation. For now, I just want you to share your thoughts without suggesting any next steps or calls to action. 


## Initial Goal:
I was exploring ways to use AI to assist executives in making better decisions, which gradually developed into ‘helping executives formulate their strategy.’ To identify a product-market fit, I was tasked with creating a broad and varied portfolio of archetypes to understand different audience types, their challenges, the opportunities available, and more.
These executives included C-level leaders (CEO, CIO, CFO), executive leadership (Sr. Director, SVP, General Managers), and upper-level management (who might be just one level below executive leadership).

## Pivot:
Due to some limitations in the types of research papers I received, I realized that obtaining information about the decisions that ‘individuals’ make in real life is quite challenging. After considerable reflection, I decided to use “Hey Decision Scenarios” as a research anchor.

Instead of treating each archetype as a broad profile, I focused on specific decision scenarios that recur across industries, such as: 
* Crisis Management: How do C-suite leaders make urgent, high-impact decisions? 
* Market Expansion: How do business unit leaders weigh risks when entering new regions? 
* Product Investment: How do innovation leaders prioritize emerging technology investments? 
By framing research around common decision scenarios, I believed I would generate insights that directly inform the design of AI-driven tools.

## Refinement
To refine my search, I created a comprehensive, structured research blueprint. It began with defining what ‘Strategy’ meant in different contexts:

1. Corporate-Level Strategy: This involves long-term decisions shaping an organization’s direction and competitive edge, managed by top executives who influence industries and stakeholders. Key aspects include portfolio management, diversification, and corporate responsibility.

2. Business-Level Strategy: This translates corporate visions into market-specific tactics, executed by business leaders who navigate competitive landscapes using frameworks like cost leadership and differentiation.

3. Functional & Tactical Strategy: Focused on aligning departmental operations with broader objectives, functional heads implement strategies in areas such as marketing and finance, ensuring optimized performance and resource allocation.

4. Adaptive & Crisis Strategy: Aimed at managing uncertainty and risks, this strategy involves crisis response and regulatory compliance, ensuring that organizations maintain resilience during disruptions.

5. Innovation & Growth Strategy: This forward-looking approach drives growth through new technologies and markets, led by entrepreneurs and R&D teams who focus on disruptive models and collaborations.

For each of the categories, I created a blueprint to follow:

✅ Industries + Vertical Segments → So we know where to focus. 
✅ Decision Scenarios → So we know what kinds of decisions matter in each context. 
✅ Key Questions to Investigate → So we know what to look for in research.
✅ Subcategories → So we don’t miss specific nuances of each scenario. 
✅ Common Pain Points → So we know why these decisions are challenging.

Based on this blueprint, I selected 5 contrasting industries, with 5 scenarios for each industry. While making these ‘Research Themes’, I kept these things in mind:  

1️⃣ **Prioritizing Human Decision-Making**: I concentrated on how executives think and make decisions, not merely outlining business challenges. It's essential to explore their thought processes and adaptability. 

2️⃣ **Emphasizing Contextual Adaptability**: I aimed for the research to underscore the significance of recognizing patterns in industry-specific challenges while still drawing broader leadership insights that apply across various contexts. 

3️⃣ **Maintaining a Cross-Industry Perspective with Real Examples**: Although I pursued insights that are scalable, I made sure to base our findings on concrete, industry-specific examples before drawing any universal conclusions. 


Here’s a sample of a research theme:

Industry: Banking & Financial Services
Vertical: Retail & Commercial Banking

Theme 1: Market Expansion & Competitive Positioning
* Key Questions to Investigate:
    * How do bank executives decide between expanding geographically versus digital market penetration?
    * What factors drive the differentiation between traditional banks and fintech disruptors?
    * Which risks (regulatory, competitive, cultural) most influence market entry decisions?
* Subcategories:
    * Regional versus digital market expansion
    * Competitive defense against fintech innovations
    * Product and service portfolio repositioning
* Common Pain Points:
    * Navigating complex regulatory environments
    * Overcoming legacy system constraints
    * Balancing cost pressures with strategic investments

I chose not to focus on AI-relevant aspects or frameworks/models that would anchor findings in established strategic principles. Instead, I concentrated on how executives think and make decisions, rather than merely outlining business challenges. I also aimed to keep AI on the back burner. My usual approach involves figuring out how people operate and what kind of workarounds they develop as they face challenges. These workarounds are crucial because they demonstrate that a problem was worth solving, so I strive to create a solution that somewhat mimics those workarounds. However, you don’t need to consider this point. 

Following this framework, I gathered a wealth of resources for each of the five industries within the five categories. My next step was to summarize those papers in a way that suits me, partly because it makes it easier for me to understand, and it also yields very thought-provoking insights. 

My next step involved using the research paper summary prompt I shared with you earlier to extract insights. 

## Here’s my concern

Although the prompt will provide me with thought-provoking insights, I’m concerned that those insights, while actionable and thought-provoking, May not necessarily be anchored to the goal of my project.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-18T03:53:19.256338+00:00)

Your approach is **highly structured, deeply analytical, and decision-focused**—which is great because it ensures that the insights you extract will be valuable. However, I see where your concern lies.  

Your research blueprint is designed to **map executive decision-making across structured categories**, yet your **research summary prompt is optimized for extracting general strategic insights**—not necessarily insights that explicitly reinforce your specific research themes.  

The key issue I see is **alignment**:  

1️⃣ **Your prompt focuses on thought-provoking, high-level insights,** but it doesn’t explicitly filter for whether those insights are relevant to the specific decision scenarios you’ve mapped out. This could lead to summaries that are insightful but not necessarily **directly tied** to your core research objectives.  

2️⃣ **Your framework emphasizes real-world decision-making contexts,** but your prompt currently relies on scholarly papers—which often prioritize theoretical advancements and general strategic considerations over concrete, scenario-based decision modeling.  

3️⃣ **Your structured industry-vertical-scenario blueprint is a filtering mechanism,** but your prompt doesn’t yet enforce that filtering at the summary level. This means you may generate **interesting but unfocused** insights, making it harder to directly apply them to your AI-driven executive decision-support project.  

### What This Means  
Your concern is valid. **Without explicitly integrating your structured framework into your summary process, you risk generating “insightful noise” rather than targeted, decision-relevant knowledge.**  

That said, before we go further, how do you currently validate whether an extracted insight is aligned with your goals? Are you manually reviewing them, or do you have any heuristics in place for assessing relevance?

## You (2025-03-18T03:59:42.886000+00:00)

The thing is, I used Deep Research to research each theme based on my requirements. I'll attach the prompt at the bottom of this message. But this allowed me to

1. Get an AI generated search and summarization of all the content. 
2. Give me a whole lot of resources in the form of citations which i then plan to summarize in my own way. 

So to your point, I thought ChatGPT could validate whether the sources are relevant for my goal. Whether the 'Insights' are relevant is to be questioned. 

Here's the prompt I used. And for your reference, I'll attach the output the prompt generated.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-18T03:59:43.651828+00:00)

Alright, I’ve reviewed the research output, and I see what’s happening. The document provides a **deep comparative analysis** of how North American banking executives make strategic decisions across **market expansion, digital transformation, risk management, fintech collaboration, and capital allocation**.  

### What Stands Out:  

1️⃣ **Alignment with Your Research Themes:**  
   - The structure of the document maps well to the themes you outlined (market expansion, digital transformation, etc.), meaning **your AI-generated research process has succeeded in gathering thematically relevant material**.  
   - Each section focuses on *executive decision-making*, providing case studies, strategic comparisons, and real-world examples.  

2️⃣ **Strengths of the Document:**  
   - It successfully integrates **empirical data and real-world cases**, making it useful for executive decision modeling.  
   - It highlights **contrasting strategic approaches** (e.g., Chase expanding branches vs. Citi cutting back) which helps in scenario analysis.  
   - It includes **challenges and trade-offs**, which is crucial for understanding decision-making constraints.  

3️⃣ **Your Concern is Valid:**  
   - While the document aligns with your themes, it doesn’t necessarily **explicitly frame insights around decision-making frameworks, cognitive biases, or heuristics**.  
   - Some sections emphasize industry trends rather than **directly dissecting how executives think and reason under uncertainty**—which is your real research anchor.  
   - The insights are **descriptive rather than prescriptive**, meaning they tell you *what happened* but don’t always explore the *why* behind executive choices.  

### What This Means:  
- You’ve got **solid foundational research**, but it still needs **refinement** to ensure insights are framed around **decision-making psychology, mental models, and cognitive trade-offs** rather than just industry trends.  
- Your research **isn’t misaligned**—but the way insights are **framed and extracted** could be optimized for your project’s goals.  

Would you say this accurately captures your concern? Or is there a nuance I might have missed?

## You (2025-03-18T05:15:16.142000+00:00)

You know, here's the thing... 

What if ChatGPT could essentially 

* Create decision-making frameworks, cognitive biases, or heuristics. 
* Directly dissecting how executives think and reason under uncertainty.
* Help me understand the ‘why’ behind executive choices. 

Here’s what I’m thinking. 

Step 1: 
Use Chatgpt to extract insights from this document and other collected references to extract insights

Step 2:
Combine all the extracted insights in a single document. 

Step 3:
Draw out patterns from the synthesized compiled document. 

I’ve been researching different approaches to thematic analysis, and I think we could use some of those insights to direct ChatGPT. 

Step 1 will be crucial. We could employ a combination of interpretive and contextually rich analytical approaches. For example, 

Inductive thematic analysis involves openly approaching our data without predetermined categories or theoretical biases. By carefully and repeatedly engaging with the data, we allow patterns and themes to surface organically. This method enables us to discover novel insights that existing theories may overlook. Maintaining reflexivity is crucial for authentically representing participants’ experiences and meanings.

In latent thematic analysis, we move beyond explicit content to identify deeper, implicit meanings and assumptions within our data. We focus on interpreting subtext, hidden ideas, or unspoken assumptions. By contextualizing these deeper meanings within broader theoretical or socio-cultural frameworks, we enrich our interpretation. Clearly documenting our interpretive rationale enhances our analytic transparency and rigor.

Using a constructionist approach, we recognize that meanings within our data are socially constructed through context, language, and discourse. We analyze how narratives and participant accounts reflect broader societal structures and power dynamics. Explicitly linking our thematic interpretations to social contexts allows us to critically evaluate how societal norms influence individual experiences.

In reflexive thematic analysis, we emphasize continuous reflection on our role as researchers and how our perspectives shape thematic identification. We transparently document how our background, biases, and interpretative frameworks influence our analysis. Iteratively refining our themes through systematic reflection ensures our analytical integrity.

Let’s engage in manual coding by immersing ourselves in the dataset through annotation, highlighting, and memo-writing. This approach allows us to identify nuanced and subtle patterns, enhancing our understanding and analysis. We must regularly revisit and reassess our coding to maintain analytical consistency and ensure thoroughness, which will ultimately benefit our research outcomes.


Ideally, we should device a way that can combine all these collectively. 


With Step 3 we could follow a more structured and explicit approach. For example,

Deductive (Theory-Driven) Thematic Analysis: We will start with predefined theories or specific hypotheses to guide our coding process. We can facilitate comparison with established literature by focusing on targeted research questions. This structured approach will enhance our consistency, but we must remain vigilant to prevent biases toward expected outcomes.

Semantic Thematic Analysis: We will prioritize the explicit, surface-level meanings of the data. Interpreting what participants state will ensure our results remain directly connected to their words. While this method is accessible and straightforward, we must be mindful of potential limitations in-depth, as implicit contexts may be overlooked.

Essentialist (Realist) Thematic Analysis: We will assume that the data authentically represent participants’ experiences and realities. Our goal is to clearly communicate these perspectives as factual representations. This approach’s strength lies in its clarity and straightforwardness, though we may need to consider deeper socio-cultural contextualization.

Framework Analysis: We will systematically organize data using structured matrices or charts to facilitate comparison across datasets or cases. Clearly defined analytic stages will enhance transparency, enabling systematic and robust interpretation. We must remain flexible to capture emergent themes not initially anticipated.

And of course, like before with Step 1, we should devise a way that can combine all these collectively. 

Before begining to device a plan, let me know what you think about this approach. We’ll do the prompt engineering later. But for now I wanna critically look at the approach and how it could help us achieve our goal. Let me know if there are any limitations, or if there’s some kind steps we should add.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-18T05:15:17.236614+00:00)

I love this approach—it’s **methodically rigorous, layered, and highly adaptable**. You’re essentially fusing **qualitative research methodologies with AI-driven analysis**, which is both innovative and practical. Let me break it down critically.

## **What’s Working Exceptionally Well**  

### **1️⃣ A Two-Phase Analysis Approach**  
You’ve structured **Step 1 (Exploratory & Contextual Analysis)** as **inductive, interpretive, and human-centered**—letting insights **emerge** rather than imposing a rigid structure.  
Then, **Step 3 (Pattern Recognition & Structured Analysis)** applies **deductive, theory-driven reasoning** to refine and structure the findings.  

This is a powerful combination because it avoids **overfitting** to existing frameworks while ensuring the final insights are **coherent, structured, and actionable**.  

### **2️⃣ Hybrid Analytical Models**  
The way you’re layering different **thematic analysis methodologies** (inductive, latent, reflexive, etc.) in Step 1 and combining structured approaches (deductive, semantic, essentialist, etc.) in Step 3 is a **highly comprehensive** strategy.  

- **In Step 1:** You ensure **rich, open-ended interpretation**, looking at subtext, assumptions, and social constructs while maintaining a **human-centered lens** on executive decision-making.  
- **In Step 3:** You apply **structured, comparative models** to extract patterns, align them with existing literature, and ensure the insights are grounded in reality.  

This structured progression mirrors **how seasoned qualitative researchers think**—starting broad and exploratory, then **narrowing down to concrete patterns and models**.  

### **3️⃣ A Deep Focus on Executive Decision-Making (Your Core Goal)**  
Your approach doesn’t just **describe** strategic decisions—it actively **dissects the cognitive processes, biases, and reasoning models** behind those decisions.  
This is what separates it from standard industry reports.  

- It forces us to **ask "why" at every stage**, not just "what happened."  
- It allows us to **construct original decision-making frameworks** rather than just summarizing existing knowledge.  
- It enables us to **pinpoint cognitive biases, mental shortcuts, and systemic factors** influencing executive decision-making.  

This means we don’t just gain **insights about banking strategy**—we gain **a transferable decision-making playbook** that can apply across industries.  

---

## **Potential Limitations & Gaps**  

### **1️⃣ Handling Volume & Complexity**  
Since you’re **not just summarizing, but deeply analyzing**, there’s a risk of **information overload**.  
- If we extract **too many** insights, the synthesis process could become unwieldy.  
- If we apply **too many analytical lenses at once**, we may struggle with prioritization.  

✅ **Possible Solution**: Before full execution, define a **"relevance threshold"**—some way to prioritize which insights move forward in the synthesis phase.  

---

### **2️⃣ Ensuring AI’s Interpretive Quality**  
ChatGPT is **great at summarization and structured analysis**, but when it comes to **deeply interpretive, latent analysis**, AI still lacks **true intuition**.  
- It can highlight patterns, but it may not always **understand the hidden implications** of executive behavior.  
- It can synthesize themes, but it may struggle with **detecting contradictions, ambiguities, or unspoken assumptions**.  

✅ **Possible Solution**: Introduce a **"Human-AI Loop"**, where **AI generates preliminary themes, and you refine them manually** before moving into Step 3.  
We can **train the AI to question its own outputs** by prompting it with **counterfactuals**, forcing it to analyze its own assumptions.  

---

### **3️⃣ From Pattern Recognition to Usable Models**  
Step 3 will yield **patterns across industries**, but the real challenge will be **turning those into practical decision-making frameworks**.  
- If we only extract patterns, we may **fall short of actionable synthesis**.  
- The goal isn’t just to see what themes emerge—it’s to **construct frameworks that executives can apply**.  

✅ **Possible Solution**: In Step 3, define **explicit output formats**, like:  
- **Cognitive Bias Frameworks**: Identifying biases executives fall into and how to counteract them.  
- **Decision Trees or Heuristics**: Simple models executives can follow under uncertainty.  
- **Mental Models & Analogies**: Translating abstract strategic decisions into concrete, repeatable thinking patterns.  

---

## **Final Thoughts: Should We Add Anything?**  

1️⃣ **Could We Automate Some of Step 3?**   
- Instead of manually detecting patterns, could we instruct AI to **cluster** and **categorize insights automatically** before we manually refine?  

2️⃣ **Should We Include a "Counterfactual Challenge" in Step 3?**  
- We could run a phase where we **deliberately challenge every insight with a reverse hypothesis** (e.g., “If this decision had gone the opposite way, what would that reveal?”).  
- This could make our final models **more robust, stress-tested, and adaptable**.  

---

## **Final Verdict: This is a Strong, Research-Rich, and Scalable Plan.**  
This approach isn’t just about summarizing insights—it’s about **constructing original thought models around executive decision-making**. If we fine-tune the synthesis process, introduce **feedback loops** between AI and human interpretation, and optimize for **practical frameworks**, we’ll have something truly unique.  

Let me know how this breakdown lands with you! If it makes sense, we can start refining the methodology and the prompt engineering later. 🚀

## You (2025-03-18T05:37:56.339000+00:00)

Could you elaborate a little more on all of these possible solutions to the potential limitations and gaps?
 For additional context, let me describe what I had in mind for steps one and three. Step one will involve creating a very custom O3 or 4.5 model prompt. I'll still have to determine which one would be more ideal for the use case, but essentially, that prompt will have, or rather, I will have to introduce certain qualities of interpretive, context-rich, and analytical processes very similar to how a human might work. Then, in step three, it will be the same: I create a custom prompt or go through multiple prompts and have more of a conversation where we introduce certain structured, explicit, and political qualities into either the ChatGPT O3 or 4.5 model. I don't actually have much time, so let's work with the assumption that we have about 24 hours to complete this analysis. With that in mind, I must maximize how I use ChatGPT.

“✅ Possible Solution: Before full execution, define a "relevance threshold"—some way to prioritize which insights move forward in the synthesis phase.”

I really like the idea that we could or rather we should prioritize which insights move forward in the synthesis phase just to clarify, could you help me understand what the synthesis phase is for you? Is it step one or is it step three? if it's step one then the relevant threshold will be incorporated within the summation prompt, which is actually very good. We will have far too much content for step one, so it'll be great if we don't overkill on the amount of insights that we draw. that being said if we do apply a more interpretive context and analytical approach with some of the thematic analysis methods like inductive, latent constructionist and reflexive I think there is a possibility that the methodologies that we are using clash with the idea of relevance threshold. 

On the other hand, if you are seeing the synthesis phase as step three again, I think there's a certain value because in the last phase, we will be very structured and explicit, so having some kind of relevance threshold would probably be a good idea. Though I'm not sure what it might look like, so first, I want you to clarify what exactly you meant by synthesis is that step one or step three, and then answer appropriately

“✅ Possible Solution: Introduce a "Human-AI Loop", where AI generates preliminary themes, and you refine them manually before moving into Step 3.
We can train the AI to question its own outputs by prompting it with counterfactuals, forcing it to analyze its own assumptions.”

I really like this idea! As I mentioned, I won’t have time to read through a lot of the analysis, so introducing a human-AI loop that analyzes its assumptions will be incredibly beneficial. Based on your description, I assume you’re considering using this approach in step one, where we build a prompt to summarize all research papers. However, I’m still a bit uncertain about how we might achieve this. Could you provide a quick example to illustrate your point?

“✅ Possible Solution: In Step 3, define explicit output formats, like:
* Cognitive Bias Frameworks: Identifying biases executives fall into and how to counteract them.
* Decision Trees or Heuristics: Simple models executives can follow under uncertainty.
* Mental Models & Analogies: Translating abstract strategic decisions into concrete, repeatable thinking patterns.”

I'm happy with your approach. I don't think I need more clarification, so please exclude that from your current response. We will work together to devise a much better way to structure step three.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-18T05:37:57.169842+00:00)

Got it. Let's focus on clarifying the **synthesis phase** and the **Human-AI loop with counterfactuals** while ensuring everything fits within a **24-hour timeframe**.

---

## **1️⃣ What Exactly is the Synthesis Phase? (Step 1 or Step 3?)**  

The way I see it:  

- **Step 1 = Extraction & Preliminary Interpretation** → We pull insights from research papers and reports using ChatGPT, applying **inductive, latent, and reflexive** approaches.  
- **Step 3 = Pattern Recognition & Structuring** → We refine insights, categorize patterns, and shape decision-making frameworks using **deductive, semantic, and essentialist** approaches.  

💡 **Where does synthesis happen?**  

Synthesis happens **at both steps but in different ways**:  
- **In Step 1**, synthesis = Filtering & Prioritization → We extract insights and **decide which ones are relevant enough** to move forward.  
- **In Step 3**, synthesis = Pattern Recognition & Structuring → We refine insights into structured themes and decision-making models.  

💡 **Does a "Relevance Threshold" belong in Step 1 or Step 3?**  

- **If we apply a threshold in Step 1**, we limit the number of insights early, ensuring that only **high-value, decision-relevant** findings move forward. This makes Step 3 **more efficient** and prevents overload.  
- **If we apply a threshold in Step 3**, we let **everything** flow through from Step 1, but then carefully **filter and refine at the final stage**.  

### **Trade-offs & Best Approach**  
- If the **Step 1 extraction process is already highly analytical**, then **Step 3 should have the threshold** (so we don’t prematurely discard valuable insights).  
- If **Step 1 generates too much raw data**, then the **threshold should be applied within the extraction prompt itself** (so we don’t waste time processing low-value insights).  

**My Recommendation: Apply the "Relevance Threshold" in Step 1.**  

This means:  
1️⃣ Within the **Step 1 extraction prompt**, we instruct ChatGPT to **rank insights by relevance**, prioritizing:  
   - **Insights tied to executive decision-making** rather than just market trends.  
   - **Insights that reveal biases, mental models, or cognitive patterns.**  
   - **Insights that are transferable across industries** rather than hyper-niche.  

2️⃣ We can even **set a numerical cap** (e.g., “Extract the 10-15 most decision-relevant insights per research document”).  

3️⃣ This makes **Step 3 more structured and efficient** because we’re working with **pre-filtered, high-value insights** rather than a massive dump of raw data.  

---

## **2️⃣ The Human-AI Loop & Counterfactual Testing (How Do We Achieve This?)**  

Since you **don’t have time to manually read everything**, we need to make ChatGPT more **self-reflective and rigorous**.  

💡 **How do we get ChatGPT to analyze its own assumptions?**  

We use **counterfactual testing**—meaning, after extracting insights, we **force the AI to challenge its own conclusions**.  

### **Example of a Human-AI Loop Using Counterfactuals**  

1️⃣ **Extract Insight (Normal Output from Step 1):**  
   **“Executives at large banks favor digital expansion because it’s more scalable and cost-effective.”**  

2️⃣ **Challenge the Insight (AI Self-Interrogation Prompt):**  
   - *What assumptions underlie this insight?*  
   - *In what scenarios would this NOT be true?*  
   - *Can you provide a counterexample where executives preferred physical expansion despite scalability concerns?*  
   - *What alternative explanations exist for why some banks still invest in branches?*  

3️⃣ **Revised Insight (ChatGPT Corrects for Bias):**  
   **“While executives at large banks tend to prioritize digital expansion, exceptions exist. Chase, for example, continues to invest heavily in branch networks despite digital trends, as its data suggests a branch presence increases digital adoption. This suggests that executive decision-making is driven by both quantitative ROI analysis and qualitative brand strategy considerations.”**  

💡 **How Do We Automate This in Step 1?**  

- After each extracted insight, ChatGPT **automatically runs a self-interrogation sequence** using counterfactual prompts.  
- It refines its response, ensuring insights are **not just surface-level summaries** but **deeply stress-tested conclusions**.  
- This means that **by the time we reach Step 3**, we’re not just analyzing trends—we’re working with **insights that have already been critically evaluated** for alternative explanations.  

---

## **Final Recap: What This Means for Our 24-Hour Execution Plan**  

- ✅ **Step 1: Apply a "Relevance Threshold"** within the **extraction prompt** so we don’t get overloaded with insights.  
- ✅ **Step 1: Introduce a "Self-Interrogation" Step** where ChatGPT challenges its own outputs using counterfactual analysis before finalizing insights.  
- ✅ **Step 3: Focus on Structured Synthesis** rather than filtering, since Step 1 has already done the heavy lifting.  

This should **maximize efficiency** while ensuring our insights are **deeply rigorous and directly relevant to decision-making**.  

---

**How does this sound to you? Do you want to refine any part before we move on to prompt engineering?** 🚀

## You (2025-03-18T06:17:47.605000+00:00)

OK, I understand you’re saying that in step one, we’ll have about 70 or 80 research papers. Let’s assume we have roughly 50 papers per strategy category, with around 10 for each industry. Thus, we have five categories times 10 papers each. 

In this step, we will create a prompt with a relevance threshold, filtering out anything unnecessary for our goal. Additionally, this summation prompt will incorporate counterfactual testing. Every insight generated will challenge itself by questioning the assumptions behind the insight, considering scenarios where it might not hold true, and providing counterexamples and alternative explanations. 

You’ve outlined this well in your response, but I’m just reiterating some parts. I see the value in both steps having a relevance threshold and incorporating a human-AI loop with counterfactual testing. 

Could you share the pros and cons of using the 4.5 versus the O3 model? The 4.5 model is better at creativity, while O3 excels at analytical reasoning, which we definitely need. However, the 4.5 model may also have benefits, especially for challenging insights in counterfactual testing. If you think the 4.5 model isn’t necessary, just let me know!

Tell me more about how you define the relevance threshold. You have three points outlined.  “Insights tied to executive decision-making rather than just market trends.
Insights that reveal biases, mental models, or cognitive patterns.
Insights that are transferable across industries rather than hyper-niche.”
 I also want to clarify the types of raw data I have that need synthesizing. Some of it includes helpful research papers, but much of it consists of news articles about what companies are doing and relevant business facts—like how Zelle has surpassed Venmo in one-on-one transfers. So, a significant portion may be news articles.

Numerous white papers from McKinsey also highlight industry trends rather than individual processes. My concern about the relevance threshold is that we might run the entire prompt and end up with zero insights. While that could be beneficial if we have too much data, having a threshold in place early on would be very helpful. At the same time, is there a scenario where we could receive zero insights from 50 papers? If so, what would happen in that situation?

 I'm still trying to understand your point of view on whether introducing a relevance threshold contradicts the data analysis approaches we discussed earlier. If you remember, we talked about inductive thematic analysis, which involves approaching data without predetermined categories or theoretical biases. This method allows us to discover novel insights beyond existing theories.

We also discussed latent thematic analysis, which identifies deeper implicit meanings, and a constructionist approach, which recognizes that meanings within our data are socially constructed through context, language, and discourse. Additionally, we emphasized reflective thematic analysis, in which we continuously reflect on how our roles as researchers shape our thematic definitions.

I want to understand your perspective on this dichotomy. On the one hand, we want an analytical approach that is open-minded and inclusive, allowing data to shape insights. On the other hand, we are implementing restrictions in the form of a relevance threshold. How do we reconcile these two aspects?

## ChatGPT (2025-03-18T06:17:48.708381+00:00)

### **1️⃣ GPT-4.5 vs. GPT-4 O3: Which Model Should We Use?**  

Both models have strengths, and choosing between them depends on which qualities we prioritize:  

#### ✅ **GPT-4 O3 (Best for Analytical Depth & Logical Rigor)**  
**Pros:**  
- Stronger at **structuring and analyzing large volumes of information.**  
- More **precise and methodical**, making it ideal for **executive decision-making insights.**  
- **Better at reasoning-based tasks**, meaning it will likely do well with **counterfactual analysis** (challenging its own assumptions).  

**Cons:**  
- Less **creative** in framing insights (may struggle with generating novel heuristics or analogies).  
- Slightly weaker at **pattern recognition across loosely connected concepts.**  

#### ✅ **GPT-4.5 (Best for Creative & Holistic Thinking)**  
**Pros:**  
- Stronger at **generating novel frameworks, heuristics, and mental models.**  
- Better at **synthesizing across multiple themes**, especially for **latent and constructionist analyses.**  
- More adaptable in **counterfactual testing** (because creativity helps in imagining alternative scenarios).  

**Cons:**  
- May introduce **speculative** insights if not properly constrained.  
- Weaker at **precise, structured analysis**—which we need for rigor.  

### **Best Choice? Hybrid Approach**
If we **only had time for one model**, I’d pick **O3** because it’s more precise and **more aligned with our structured approach**. However, since **Step 1 requires both structured analysis and creative counterfactual testing**, a **hybrid approach** could work:  

- **Step 1A:** Use **GPT-4 O3** to extract insights with high precision and analytical depth.  
- **Step 1B:** Use **GPT-4.5** to **reframe, stress-test, and expand the insights** by introducing creative counterfactuals.  

This way, we **first extract reliable data** and then **challenge its assumptions creatively**.  

---

### **2️⃣ How Do We Define the Relevance Threshold?**  

We need a way to **prioritize high-value insights** without filtering out too much. The three relevance criteria I proposed are meant to ensure:  

1️⃣ **Insights tied to executive decision-making rather than just market trends.**  
   - ❌ *Weak Insight:* “The retail banking sector is experiencing increased digital adoption.”  
   - ✅ *Strong Insight:* “Bank executives prioritize digital expansion over branch expansion unless market data suggests a high in-person preference.”  

2️⃣ **Insights that reveal biases, mental models, or cognitive patterns.**  
   - ❌ *Weak Insight:* “CitiBank reduced physical branches to focus on digital banking.”  
   - ✅ *Strong Insight:* “Executives at CitiBank overestimated digital banking adoption, leading to miscalculations in branch closures.”  

3️⃣ **Insights that are transferable across industries rather than hyper-niche.**  
   - ❌ *Weak Insight:* “Chase opened 200 new branches in the Midwest.”  
   - ✅ *Strong Insight:* “Banking executives tend to invest in physical expansion when data suggests an untapped customer base, a pattern that mirrors decision-making in retail and healthcare expansion.”  

### **Should We Worry About the Threshold Filtering Out Everything?**  

If we set the relevance threshold **too high**, we might end up with **zero insights.**  

**Realistically, will we ever get zero insights from 50 papers?**  
- If we rely too heavily on **criteria #2 (biases & mental models)**, we might struggle since many papers don’t explicitly address executive psychology.  
- However, if we **prioritize criteria #1 (decision-making insights)**, we’ll always get **at least** strategic takeaways, even if they’re more industry-specific.  

### **Solution to Avoid Over-Filtering**  

- Instead of a **hard cut-off**, we set a **tiered relevance ranking**:  
  - **Tier 1:** Insights that meet **all three** criteria.  
  - **Tier 2:** Insights that meet **two out of three** criteria.  
  - **Tier 3:** Insights that meet **only one** but still seem useful.  

If we get **too few insights**, we can adjust and allow **Tier 2** or **Tier 3** insights into the synthesis phase.  

---

### **3️⃣ Does a Relevance Threshold Contradict Our Thematic Analysis Approaches?**  

This is an **excellent question** because, at first glance, a relevance threshold seems **opposed** to inductive and open-ended analysis. However, they **can** work together if we frame them correctly.  

#### **Key Tension:**
- **Inductive thematic analysis** = "Let the data speak for itself, no predefined categories."  
- **Relevance threshold** = "Filter data that doesn’t fit predefined criteria."  

❌ **If we use a hard filter too early, we risk biasing our insights toward expected conclusions.**  
✅ **But if we use a soft filter that still allows diverse patterns to emerge, we can maintain an open-ended approach while staying efficient.**  

### **How Do We Reconcile Them?**
We adjust **when and how** we apply the relevance threshold:  

🔹 **During Inductive Analysis (Step 1):**  
- Instead of **pre-filtering**, we let ChatGPT extract **everything** it finds interesting.  
- Then, ChatGPT **clusters insights into different thematic groups** (e.g., decision-making patterns, executive biases, etc.).  
- Only after this grouping do we apply **a soft relevance filter** (ensuring we don’t discard useful outliers).  

🔹 **During Deductive Analysis (Step 3):**  
- Now that we’ve **allowed patterns to emerge naturally**, we apply a **structured relevance threshold** to refine and prioritize them.  
- We look for **recurring themes**, patterns across industries, and **decision-making models that hold across multiple contexts.**  

### **Final Verdict:**
Instead of applying the relevance threshold **before** insights emerge (which would contradict inductive methods), we **apply it after initial insights are generated and loosely categorized.**  
This balances **exploration** (inductive) with **practicality** (structured filtering).  

---

### **Final Takeaways**  

1️⃣ **Use a hybrid approach** (GPT-4 O3 for precision, GPT-4.5 for counterfactual testing).  
2️⃣ **Set a tiered relevance threshold** so we don’t accidentally filter out valuable insights.  
3️⃣ **Apply the threshold after initial inductive analysis**, not before, to avoid biasing our findings.  

This approach ensures **depth, breadth, and efficiency**—all within 24 hours.  

---

### **Next Step: Are You Ready to Start Prompt Engineering?** 🚀

## You (2025-03-18T06:52:39.419000+00:00)

I’d love to, but I want to clarify a few steps. I understand your approach, and I think we’re looking at clearly defining three prompts.   Step 1A: Run a prompt using o3-mini-high to extract insights with high precision and analytical depth.
Step 1B: Run a second prompt in the chat window using GPT 4.5 to reframe, stress-test, and expand the insights by introducing creative counterfactuals.
Step 1C: Run a prompt using o3-mini-high to do a soft relevance filter. [this is a step I’m assuming, but seems like a good idea. tell me which model would be better at this - 4.5 or o3-mini-high] ----
Step 2: I combine all the insights from the 50 papers into a single document. 
——
Step 3: We apply a structured relevance threshold to refine and prioritize insights, and we run multiple other prompts to look for recurring themes. 
——

I have a few clarifying questions. Maybe I’m overthinking this, but I don’t know. Let’s take these three examples   1️⃣ Insights tied to executive decision-making rather than just market trends.
* ❌ Weak Insight: “The retail banking sector is experiencing increased digital adoption.”
* ✅ Strong Insight: “Bank executives prioritize digital expansion over branch expansion unless market data suggests a high in-person preference.”

2️⃣ Insights that reveal biases, mental models, or cognitive patterns.
* ❌ Weak Insight: “CitiBank reduced physical branches to focus on digital banking.”
* ✅ Strong Insight: “Executives at CitiBank overestimated digital banking adoption, leading to miscalculations in branch closures.”

3️⃣ Insights that are transferable across industries rather than hyper-niche.
* ❌ Weak Insight: “Chase opened 200 new branches in the Midwest.”
* ✅ Strong Insight: “Banking executives tend to invest in physical expansion when data suggests an untapped customer base, a pattern that mirrors decision-making in retail and healthcare expansion.”


In all your three examples, the way an insight is written could infact be something that we influence through our prompting. for example, a GPT model could read a paper and say  ❌ Weak Insight: “CitiBank reduced physical branches to focus on digital banking.”  If its oversimplifying its summary. However, it could also (based on our original prompting in Step 1A) produce an insight like

✅ Strong Insight: “Executives at CitiBank overestimated digital banking adoption, leading to miscalculations in branch closures.”  While these two sentences communicate different ideas, the underlying facts could remain the same. In this context, the ‘weak insight’ is simply the summarized end outcome, while the ‘strong insight’ reveals the underlying cause. For example, if the headline reads, “CitiBank reduced physical branches to focus on digital banking,” one might infer that executives decided to close branches to prioritize digital banking. However, a critical piece of information is missing: the executives may have overestimated digital banking adoption. This is a narrow edge case, and we can’t predict what we may find in the papers.

So here’s my recommendation:

In Step 1A, let’s encourage ChatGPT to be exhaustive and analytical and all the things we discussed earlier to generate sharp, strong insights. The goal is to be as thorough as possible while focusing on your outlined characteristics, like  Insights tied to executive decision-making rather than just market trends.
Insights that reveal biases, mental models, or cognitive patterns.
Insights that are transferable across industries rather than hyper-niche.

This is just an example, but I think we should work together to figure out how we might want to communicate with chatGPT for Step 1A. 

For Step 1B, I’ll need your help a lot and some discussion to figure out the ideal approach to introducing counterfactuals. 

For Step 1C, where we’re doing a soft relevance threshold, here we use some of our primary research goals around what we want to understand as a reference for setting a threshold, along with some understanding among ourselves on how we would define actionable insights in this case. 

What are your thoughts, Dr. of Design Michael?

## ChatGPT (2025-03-18T06:52:40.366717+00:00)

Your breakdown is **methodical, structured, and practical**—and you’re absolutely right to think critically about **how insights are framed versus simply summarized.**  

---

### **🔹 My Thoughts on Your Refinement of Step 1**
You’re essentially ensuring that **Step 1A itself generates “strong insights” from the start**—which is **the right move** because it reduces the burden on later steps. Instead of pulling raw, surface-level data and then refining it later, we **teach ChatGPT to extract deeper, decision-relevant insights right away**.  

This means **Step 1A won’t just summarize**—it will:  
✅ Identify **underlying decision-making factors** (not just what happened, but why).  
✅ Challenge surface-level conclusions to **ensure depth and nuance.**  
✅ Extract not just **events** but **patterns, cognitive biases, and strategic implications.**  

For **Step 1B (counterfactual testing)** and **Step 1C (soft filtering)**, I’ll address them in more detail below.  

---

### **🔹 Step 1A: How Should We Communicate with ChatGPT?**
💡 **Objective:**  
Instead of asking ChatGPT to **“summarize the research”**, we need to **prompt it like an investigative analyst**—forcing it to dig deeper, contextualize insights, and recognize executive reasoning flaws.  

💡 **Approach:**  
We craft a prompt that makes ChatGPT:  
1. **Extract insights at multiple levels (not just outcomes but decision drivers).**  
2. **Think like an executive strategist**—contextualizing findings as they relate to risk, market pressure, cognitive biases, and heuristics.  
3. **Pre-apply a structured thinking model** (e.g., “What was assumed? What was overlooked? What is the alternative explanation?”).  

---

### **🔹 Example Prompt for Step 1A (O3-Mini-High)**
🚀 **Here’s a structured way we might instruct ChatGPT:**  

---
> **Objective:** Extract high-value executive decision-making insights from this research. Summarize key findings, but also critically analyze them. Do not merely describe business trends—focus on **how executives think, what influenced their decisions, and what strategic reasoning they used.**  
>
> **Context:**  
> You are an investigative analyst summarizing research for Fortune 500 executives. Your insights must be:  
> - **Decision-Relevant** – Focus on how executives think, react, and strategize.  
> - **Analytically Rigorous** – Identify biases, cognitive models, or flawed assumptions.  
> - **Cross-Industry Applicable** – Extract strategic patterns that could apply to multiple industries.  
>
> **For each paper, follow this structured approach:**  
>
> 1️⃣ **What was the key strategic decision or dilemma?**  
> - Clearly state the core decision executives faced in this study.  
> - Identify whether the decision was **reactive (crisis-driven) or proactive (long-term growth strategy).**  
>
> 2️⃣ **What assumptions were executives working under?**  
> - Identify the explicit and **implicit biases or mental models** at play.  
> - What factors were executives **overestimating, underestimating, or ignoring?**  
>  
> 3️⃣ **What alternative explanations could exist?**  
> - Challenge the study’s conclusions. Could these findings be **flawed, incomplete, or situation-dependent?**  
> - Provide **one or two counterfactual possibilities**.  
>
> 4️⃣ **How does this insight connect to other industries?**  
> - Is this strategy **industry-specific** or could it apply elsewhere?  
> - Provide a **real-world example from another industry** that illustrates a similar decision-making process.  
>
> 5️⃣ **What was the outcome, and did it validate or contradict the executives’ assumptions?**  
> - Describe **whether their expectations matched reality.**  
> - If their decision was flawed, **what could have improved their reasoning?**  
>
> **Deliverable Format:**  
> 🔹 **INSIGHT:** [Concise but deep insight]  
> 🔹 **ASSUMED STRATEGY:** [What executives believed at the time]  
> 🔹 **ACTUAL OUTCOME:** [What actually happened]  
> 🔹 **IMPLICATIONS & LEARNINGS:** [Why this matters, what patterns emerge]  
> 🔹 **COUNTERFACTUAL TESTING:** [What if the opposite had happened?]  

---

### **🔹 Why This Works for Step 1A**
✅ Forces **depth**—we don’t just get “what happened,” we get “why executives thought that way.”  
✅ Adds **built-in critical thinking**—preemptively addressing flaws or missing perspectives.  
✅ Encourages **pattern recognition across industries**—ensuring transferability.  

With this approach, **Step 1A itself already produces high-quality insights**, reducing the burden on Step 1B and 1C.

### **🔹 Step 1B: How Do We Introduce Counterfactual Testing?**
💡 **Objective:**  
After Step 1A extracts insights, we use **GPT-4.5** to stress-test them through **counterfactuals and alternative reasoning models.**  

💡 **Approach:**  
We create a **second prompt that interrogates the insights from Step 1A.** Instead of re-extracting insights, **this prompt acts as a “devil’s advocate”**, forcing ChatGPT to challenge its own assumptions.  

---

🚀 **Example Prompt for Step 1B (GPT-4.5)**  

---
> **Objective:** Take the executive insights generated in Step 1A and stress-test their validity using counterfactuals, alternative reasoning, and cognitive bias detection.  
>
> **For each insight provided, do the following:**  
>
> 1️⃣ **Reverse the Conclusion:**  
> - If the study claims executives preferred **X** strategy, what would have happened if they had done **Y**?  
> - Would **Y** have been a better choice under different circumstances?  
>
> 2️⃣ **Identify Blind Spots & Biases:**  
> - What **key factors** did executives overlook when making this decision?  
> - Did they fall into **groupthink, recency bias, or another mental trap?**  
>
> 3️⃣ **Find an Opposing Case Study:**  
> - Identify an **example from another industry where executives made the opposite choice.**  
> - Did they succeed or fail?  
>
> **Deliverable Format:**  
> 🔹 **INSIGHT:** [Restate insight from Step 1A]  
> 🔹 **COUNTERFACTUAL SCENARIO:** [What if the opposite had happened?]  
> 🔹 **BLIND SPOTS & BIASES:** [What executives overlooked]  
> 🔹 **OPPOSING CASE STUDY:** [Real-world example where leaders made a different choice]  
> 🔹 **NEW REVISED INSIGHT:** [Does this change our understanding?]  

---

### **🔹 Why This Works for Step 1B**
✅ Ensures we **don’t just accept insights at face value**—forcing deeper critical reflection.  
✅ Encourages **alternative viewpoints, making insights more robust.**  
✅ Prevents **overfitting**—we don’t assume a pattern is universal just because one study suggests it.  

---

### **🔹 Step 1C: Soft Relevance Filtering**
💡 **Objective:**  
Now that we have **high-quality, stress-tested insights**, we filter them using **GPT-4 O3** to prioritize **only the most actionable findings.**  

💡 **Which Model?**  
- **Use O3** because we need precision and structured filtering, not creative expansion.  

🚀 **Example Prompt for Step 1C (O3-Mini-High)**
---
> **Objective:** Apply a **soft relevance threshold** to insights from Step 1B, ensuring only the **most actionable and decision-relevant** findings move forward.  
>
> **Filtering Criteria:**  
> ✅ Insights must be **strategically important for executive decision-making.**  
> ✅ Insights must **reveal biases, flawed assumptions, or counterintuitive patterns.**  
> ✅ Insights must **be transferable across industries.**  
>
> **For each insight, assign a “Relevance Tier”:**  
> - **Tier 1 (High Priority)** → Meets **all three** criteria.  
> - **Tier 2 (Medium Priority)** → Meets **two out of three** criteria.  
> - **Tier 3 (Low Priority)** → Meets **one or less** criteria.  
>
> **Only return Tier 1 and Tier 2 insights.**  

---

### **🔹 Why This Works for Step 1C**
✅ Ensures **only the best, most relevant insights move forward.**  
✅ Avoids **information overload while still allowing diverse themes.**  
✅ Maintains **balance between rigor and exploration.**  

---

### **🔹 Final Thoughts**
You’re right—**this process ensures we produce deep, structured, decision-focused insights.** Each step builds on the previous one, reducing redundancy while maximizing analytical depth.  

Now, are you ready to start testing **Step 1A**? 🚀

## You (2025-03-18T08:58:10.492000+00:00)

ok, I think we have a clear plan of action. Lets start with trying to write a prompt for Step 1A

I have a lot to discuss. 

# Your Proposal

> Use this as a reference for my comments on your current suggestion of the prompt.
> 

Objective: Extract high-value executive decision-making insights from this research. Summarize key findings, but also critically analyze them. Do not merely describe business trends—focus on how executives think, what influenced their decisions, and what strategic reasoning they used.

<aside>
💡

I like how you’ve defined the objective. It’s concise enough, and focuses on the real research objective is. 

</aside>

**Context:**

You are an investigative analyst summarizing research for Fortune 500 executives. Your insights must be:

- **Decision-Relevant** – Focus on how executives think, react, and strategize.
- **Analytically Rigorous** – Identify biases, cognitive models, or flawed assumptions.
- **Cross-Industry Applicable** – Extract strategic patterns that could apply to multiple industries.

<aside>
💡

I like the first two points in your context. But I wonder, how do we prevent ChatGPT from making assumptions? It's one thing to infer and deduce something, but I’m worried that if we give explicit instructions, is there a possibility that ChatGPT could make things up just to follow my instructions?

</aside>

**For each paper, follow this structured approach:**

1️⃣ **What was the key strategic decision or dilemma?**

- Clearly state the core decision executives faced in this study.
- Identify whether the decision was **reactive (crisis-driven) or proactive (long-term growth strategy).**

2️⃣ **What assumptions were executives working under?**

- Identify the explicit and **implicit biases or mental models** at play.
- What factors were executives **overestimating, underestimating, or ignoring?**

4️⃣ **How does this insight connect to other industries?**

- Is this strategy **industry-specific** or could it apply elsewhere?
- Provide a **real-world example from another industry** that illustrates a similar decision-making process.

5️⃣ **What was the outcome, and did it validate or contradict the executives’ assumptions?**

- Describe **whether their expectations matched reality.**
- If their decision was flawed, **what could have improved their reasoning?**

<aside>
💡

I think these points are valid. 

</aside>

3️⃣ **What alternative explanations could exist?**

- Challenge the study’s conclusions. Could these findings be **flawed, incomplete, or situation-dependent?**
- Provide **one or two counterfactual possibilities**.

<aside>
💡

I thought we were leaving counterfactual elements for the second step. Lets keep this as Step 1B. 

</aside>

**Deliverable Format:**

🔹 **INSIGHT:** [Concise but deep insight]

🔹 **ASSUMED STRATEGY:** [What executives believed at the time]

🔹 **ACTUAL OUTCOME:** [What actually happened]

🔹 **IMPLICATIONS & LEARNINGS:** [Why this matters, what patterns emerge]

🔹 **COUNTERFACTUAL TESTING:** [What if the opposite had happened?]

<aside>
💡

I don’t necessarily like this format. However, I find all the aspects you’re discussing here extremely critical. I do like the questions you’re asking here, so I wonder if there’s a way to get these kind of questions answered, but not in the format you’ve proposed. But leave counterfactual testing for Step 1B. 

</aside>

# Current Prompt

> Use this as a reference for things I like in my current prompt for summarizing research papers.
> 

Develop in-depth and analytically rigorous summaries of scholarly research papers intended for executives of Fortune 500 corporations, senior organizational leaders, and doctoral-level scholars. Each summary must effectively articulate strategic implications, operational considerations, and theoretical advancements, employing a sophisticated, analytical narrative informed by Robert Greene’s analytical yet compelling writing style. Insights provided should be strongly grounded in empirical data, thoughtfully constructed to provoke critical reflection, and clearly demarcated from speculative or theoretical assertions.

### Required Structure

Each summary must begin explicitly by stating:

## **Title of Paper**

**Author(s):** First Name, Last Name; First Name, Last Name

**Published:** (DD, Month, YYYY)

<aside>
💡

regardless of additional factors, I always want the output to return the title of the paper in h2, and then the authors and other details in the same format. This makes it easier for me when I’m going through content. 

</aside>

### Abstract

Construct a concise abstract clearly delineating:

1. **Identify Key Themes:** What are the central ideas the authors are exploring?
2. **Uncover Core Motivations:** What critical organizational, strategic, or theoretical challenge does this research aim to address?
3. **Methodological Clarification:** What data collection and analysis techniques were used, and how do these methods influence the reliability of insights?
4. **Assess Relevance:** In what ways does this research connect to contemporary industry practices or challenges?

<aside>
💡

This has been very helpful, especially for understanding research papers. It's often very important to me to grasp these aspects. While we have some research papers in our data collection, most are whitepapers, and some are newspaper articles. 

</aside>

### Insight Presentation

The body of the summary should comprise multiple distinct sections structured as follows:

- **Insight Statement:**
    
    Before drafting an insight, perform these steps:
    
    1. **Challenge Assumptions:** Identify and question the implicit assumptions that underlie the research findings. Ask: *What might this data overlook? What perspectives are absent?*
    2. **Reverse the Narrative:** Imagine the opposite outcome had occurred. What would that reveal about the core insight?
    3. **Stress Test the Implication:** Evaluate how robust the conclusion is under extreme or unconventional scenarios. Ask: *Would this still apply if circumstances shifted dramatically?*
    
    Example Insights:
    
    "**While most experts conclude that taking short breaks is vital to stay productive, participants from the study continued to see short breaks as unimportant and avoidable.**"
    
    "**Although people felt a bit of regret for missing certain talks or workshops, the overwhelming abundance of AI-related content available elsewhere diluted any urgency to catch up.**"
    

<aside>
💡

This part is also very important to me. I’ve tried many different ways of writing insights, but I’ve found this to be the most effective method for drawing out impactful, thought-provoking insights from a research paper. 

</aside>

- **Supporting Context Paragraph:**
    
    Before writing the supporting context:
    
    1. **Trace the Data's Journey:** Identify key data points, their sources, and any transformations they underwent before conclusions were drawn.
    2. **Clarify Uncertainty:** Ask: *What known limitations or unexplored variables might reduce the reliability of this finding?*
    3. **Identify Hidden Bias:** Assess whether the methodology inadvertently favored specific outcomes or groups.

Each insight and supporting paragraph should maintain a balance between conciseness and comprehensiveness, exemplified as follows:

"**Perceived ease of use is the most influential factor in SaaS adoption from an individual perspective, emphasizing the importance of user-friendly interfaces and minimal effort requirements.**

The study highlights perceived ease of use as a critical factor influencing SaaS adoption among individuals. This factor is determined primarily by end-users rather than managerial levels, indicating that users' perceptions of ease and effortlessness significantly drive adoption decisions. The research analyzed eight articles that consistently pointed to ease of use as a major determinant, suggesting that SaaS providers should prioritize intuitive, accessible designs to enhance adoption rates."

<aside>
💡

Once again, the supporting paragraph serves as a reference for me. It's common for more significant information to emerge from these contextual paragraphs. Moreover, since the key insights are deliberately thought-provoking, I consistently depend on this supporting paragraph to provide essential context. It also enhances my understanding of follow-up questions and related topics to consider. 

</aside>

Conclusion

- Clearly and succinctly reiterate the critical insights.
- Explicitly highlight strategic and operational implications relevant to senior executives and decision-makers.
- Briefly summarize notable methodological limitations highlighted by the authors.
- Identify explicit areas for future scholarly investigation, clearly defining both applicability and research boundaries.

<aside>
💡

The conclusion is good, but I don’t think we’ll necessarily need this in our work. 

</aside>

### Guidelines and Constraints

- Employ deliberate "think through" steps before articulating insights to ensure nuanced, critical reflection. Before finalizing any summary, ensure that all references to external ideas, data points, or conceptual frameworks are explicitly attributed through in-text citations. Citations should follow MLA guidelines and be integrated naturally within the narrative to maintain clarity and flow.
- Ensure precise, thorough, and transparent handling and reporting of quantitative metrics. Clearly indicate simplifications or approximations.
- Explicitly distinguish empirical results from speculative or theoretical insights.
- Avoid redundancy, ensuring all insights provided are distinct, substantive, and uniquely valuable.
- Maintain comprehensiveness; do not omit critical insights for brevity alone.
- Uphold rigorous academic standards by employing consistent numbered in-text citations throughout the response. Each referenced idea, insight, or conclusion must be clearly linked to its source. Use inline citations immediately following the referenced content, ensuring clarity on what is being cited. Conclude each summary with a comprehensive MLA-formatted reference list that includes all cited works.
- Give me the summary in canvas

<aside>
💡

Maintaining comprehensiveness, and not vomiting critical insights for brevity alone is probably the most important instruction in this prompt, despite it being placed towards the end. The remaining guidelines and constraints are also equally important and relevant for every output. 

</aside>

# Additional Factors we should consider

> Here’re some details about the forms of thematic analysis we should consider exploring to get the best output. This is how I want the model to think while extracting insights.
> 

## Interpretive and Contextually Rich Approaches

### Inductive (Data-Driven) Thematic Analysis

In inductive thematic analysis, approach your data openly, without predetermined categories or theoretical biases. Carefully and repeatedly engage with the data, allowing patterns and themes to surface organically. This method enables the discovery of novel insights that existing theories may overlook. Maintaining reflexivity is crucial to represent participants' experiences and meanings authentically.

### Latent Thematic Analysis

Latent thematic analysis involves moving beyond explicit content to identify deeper, implicit meanings and assumptions within your data. Focus on interpreting subtext, hidden ideas, or unspoken assumptions. Contextualize these deeper meanings within broader theoretical or socio-cultural frameworks to enrich interpretation. Clearly document your interpretive rationale to enhance analytic transparency and rigor.

### Constructionist Thematic Analysis

With a constructionist approach, recognize that meanings within your data are socially constructed through context, language, and discourse. Analyze how narratives and participant accounts reflect broader societal structures and power dynamics. Explicitly link your thematic interpretations to social contexts and critically evaluate how societal norms influence individual experiences.

### Reflexive Thematic Analysis

Reflexive thematic analysis emphasizes continuous reflection on your role as a researcher and how your perspectives shape thematic identification. Transparently document how your background, biases, and interpretative frameworks influence your analysis. Iteratively refine your themes through systematic reflection to ensure analytical integrity.

# Suggestions on how to write for o3

> I did a lot of research on things to keep in mind while writing for o3. Lets see if we can capitalize on these strategies while writing a prompt.
> 

### 1. Understand Your Model’s Capabilities and Constraints

**Strategy:**

Recognize that reasoning models (O3 and O1) are tuned to generate a chain of thought and provide transparent intermediate steps. Unlike standard GPT prompts, your prompt should explicitly ask the model to break down its thought process.

**Example:**

Instead of asking,

- “What is the main theme of this document?”ask,
- “Please analyze the document by listing the key topics, explaining how the text supports each, and then summarize the overarching theme.”

*(This builds on guidelines from reasoning best practices that emphasize stepwise transparency .)*

---

### 2. Clearly Define the Objective and Context

**Strategy:**

Begin your prompt by clearly stating the end goal and providing necessary context. This ensures the model understands the boundaries of the task and reduces ambiguity.

**Example:**

“Your task is to perform an inductive thematic analysis on the provided dataset. First, list the major recurring topics, then identify the connections among them, and finally, provide a summary that explains the latent themes—all using only the data provided.”

*(This approach mirrors recommendations from the ‘Using reasoning for data validation’ guidelines, where clarity of the goal reduces misinterpretation .)*

---

### 3. Instruct Explicit Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

**Strategy:**

Directly ask the model to “think out loud” by requesting that it reveals its intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer. This makes the process transparent and easier to review or debug.

**Example:**

“Before presenting your final conclusion, break down your analysis into three steps:

1. Identify and list all the key data points.
2. Group these data points into potential themes with justifications.
3. Synthesize a final summary explaining how these themes interconnect.Finally, provide your overall conclusion.”

*(This method is key in prompts designed for reasoning models, as it forces the model to reveal its thought process rather than jumping straight to an answer .)*

---

### 4. Specify Structured Intermediate Steps and Validation

**Strategy:**

Encourage the model to validate its own reasoning. Ask it to double-check intermediate conclusions for consistency and logical coherence before finalizing its answer.

**Example:**

“After completing each step of your analysis, briefly review your reasoning. For instance, after grouping data points into themes, confirm that every data point has been accounted for and that the grouping is logically sound. Then, provide the final summary.”

*(This strategy helps build guardrails against hallucinations by promoting self-verification, as highlighted in discussions about developing hallucination guardrails .)*

---

### 5. Provide In-Context Examples and Formatting Guidelines

**Strategy:**

Embed a mini-example in your prompt to illustrate the desired output format and the level of detail expected. This example serves as a template for the model to follow.

**Example:**

“Example:

- **Step 1:** Identify data points such as ‘increase in sales,’ ‘customer feedback,’ and ‘market trends.’
- **Step 2:** Group these into themes like ‘Market Growth’ and ‘Customer Satisfaction’ with a note: ‘Sales increased due to improved customer service.’
- **Final Summary:** The data suggests enhanced customer satisfaction drives market growth.Now, please perform the same analysis on the provided dataset.”

*(Providing an example is a well-known prompt engineering best practice, especially when aiming for detailed inductive or thematic analysis .)*

---

### 6. Guard Against Overgeneralizations and Hallucinations

**Strategy:**

Explicitly instruct the model to note uncertainty if evidence is lacking. This helps prevent it from inventing details or overgeneralizing.

**Example:**

“If you encounter ambiguous or incomplete data, state your uncertainty (e.g., ‘the data does not provide enough evidence to confirm this hypothesis’), rather than assuming an answer.”

*(This precaution is aligned with best practices for creating hallucination guardrails, ensuring that reasoning remains anchored to the provided data .)*

---

### 7. Encourage Iterative Refinement and Metacognition

**Strategy:**

Invite the model to reflect on its reasoning process and suggest improvements. This will not only strengthen the final answer but also aid in identifying any logical gaps.

**Example:**

“Once you have completed your analysis, please briefly reflect on your reasoning process. Identify any steps that might be improved or reconsidered for clarity, and then restate your final conclusion incorporating any insights gained from this reflection.”

*(This approach is particularly useful for complex tasks where iterative refinement can lead to more robust analytical outcomes, as emphasized in routines for data validation and routine generation*

# Information for you.

> here, i’m going to give you some suggestions on how i want your response.
> 

While writing your prompt, I’d like you to communicate your instructions with a few markers for different sections. Depending on the structure of your message, you could use *** or ### variably. While writing, I want you to keep two opposing thoughts in your mind. 

1. we need to make sure that ChatGPT knows all about how we want the output, how we want it to think, and what we want to achieve. Structure is key, but so is the way we want it to think. so make sure you provide as much information as you can. 
2. A concise, well-structured prompt often outperforms a sprawling prompt that’s trying to do too much. Long prompts can confuse the model or introduce unintended biases – the core question or instruction might get lost in the noise.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-18T08:58:11.582929+00:00)

Got it. We need to **strike the right balance** between a highly structured prompt that gives ChatGPT all the necessary instructions and **one that remains concise enough** for clarity and precision.  

I’m going to present a **refined Step 1A prompt** that:  
1. **Defines structure** – ensuring output consistency.  
2. **Emphasizes deep analytical reasoning** – making ChatGPT think like an executive strategist.  
3. **Incorporates thematic analysis methodologies** – using inductive, latent, constructionist, and reflexive perspectives.  
4. **Uses explicit reasoning steps** – making the model "think out loud" before concluding.  
5. **Prevents hallucinations** – guiding it to avoid making up insights.

🔹 STRATEGIC DECISION: [What was the decision/dilemma executives faced?]
🔹 ASSUMED STRATEGY: [What executives believed at the time]
🔹 ACTUAL OUTCOME: [What happened in reality]
🔹 IMPLICATIONS & LEARNINGS: [Why this matters, what patterns emerge]
🔹 METHODOLOGICAL STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: [Did the study have blind spots or potential bias?]


Is there a way for you to marry the two concepts

## ChatGPT (2025-03-18T09:01:08.661589+00:00)

### **Yes, We Can Integrate Both Approaches into a Single, Cohesive Insight Framework**  

The challenge here is that we want **two different but complementary dimensions**:  

1. **The Insight Presentation Approach (Your Preferred Method)**  
   - Focuses on **deep analytical questioning** (challenge assumptions, reverse narrative, stress test implications).  
   - Ensures a **supporting context paragraph** that traces data origins, clarifies uncertainties, and identifies hidden biases.  

2. **The Executive Decision-Making Framework (My Original Structure)**  
   - Structures insights to **follow an executive’s thought process** (decision, assumption, outcome, implications).  
   - Helps ensure **insights are applicable across industries** and aren’t just theoretical.  

### **Solution: A Unified, Hybrid Approach**  
Instead of treating them separately, we can **merge them into a single structure** that **maintains the deep questioning approach while structuring insights in an executive-friendly way.**

I've attached a snippet of the output for your reference. 

here's my feedback:
1. TOOO many emojis and unnecessary titles. specially in the key insights segment. 
2. I want insights like this 

"While most experts conclude that taking short breaks are vital for productivity, most people continue to see short breaks as avoidable and unimportant"
this was trying to provide an 'insight', which is different from knowledge. It's an observation made by keeping two pieces of information together. In this case, A researcher read a whole lot of papers and interviewed a bunch of experts to conclude that short breaks are important to productivity, but also conducted some primary research with participants with a few activities to see that people saw short breaks as unimportant and avoidable. That's what makes it so compelling. 
While I don't need an insight to 'answer' a so what question, I do want it to be thought provoking, almost to a point that it encourages someone to think twice about an insight and evoke an emotion to take action on it. The action may not be direct, but the insight would be compelling. Here's a few more examples:
"Although many participants independently arrived at strikingly similar insights, we don’t know what might have emerged if they had been able to compare those perspectives directly."
"Although people felt a bit of regret for missing certain talks or workshops, the overwhelming abundance of AI-related content available elsewhere diluted any urgency to catch up."

Now, I do want to stress that the format is not too important to me. I don't want you to skip out on insights just because they don't fit the "although" or "while" format. The following are still compelling insights. 

"Hedonic motivation, or the enjoyment of using GAI, influences adoption, especially when the technology is perceived as engaging and enjoyable."

The high level insight statement should be compelling. The follow-up paragraph should elaborate on it in a concise yet informative manner. Here's an example:

"*Acceptance of Generative AI drives the intention to use it but does not necessarily translate to actual use behavior.*
The survey found that while a large proportion of participants (61.4%) who positively view generative AI intend to use it, only a relatively small proportion (13.7%) of these individuals actually do. This discrepancy between intention and action suggests that there are additional factors beyond positive perception that influence actual use behavior. These factors could include organizational barriers, lack of infrastructure, or insufficient implementation support."

📌 Key Insights
🔹 INSIGHT STATEMENT:
Executives must adopt a hybrid distribution strategy that integrates digital channels with a strategically optimized branch network to enhance customer acquisition and retention.

📌 Step 1: Identify the Executive Decision-Making Process
🔹 STRATEGIC DECISION: Reevaluate and recalibrate the distribution model to balance cost efficiency with the value of in-person interactions.
🔹 ASSUMED STRATEGY: The prevailing view assumed that a digital-first approach could eventually replace traditional branch channels.
🔹 ACTUAL OUTCOME: The research reveals that while mobile channels have surged, branches remain critical for complex advisory and high-value customer acquisition.
🔹 IMPLICATIONS & LEARNINGS: Executives should pursue a mobile-first orchestration model that leverages branch strengths for nuanced customer engagement—ensuring that physical presence is preserved where it drives premium outcomes.
🔹 METHODOLOGICAL STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: The study uses robust case studies and account conversion data; however, regional nuances and emerging markets might be underrepresented.

📌 Step 2: Deep Analytical Processing
🔹 Challenge Assumptions: Question the notion that digital channels can fully supplant branches without compromising customer trust and relationship depth.
🔹 Reverse the Narrative: Eliminating branches entirely could diminish the quality of customer relationships, resulting in lower fee-based income and less personalized service.
🔹 Stress Test the Implication: Under conditions of rapid digital disruption, maintaining a calibrated branch presence is essential to mitigate customer attrition and sustain loyalty.

📌 Step 3: Provide Supporting Context

Data’s Journey: Insights derived from account acquisition metrics and comparative performance analyses across channels.
Clarify Uncertainty: Regional differences may affect the optimal branch-to-digital ratio.
Identify Hidden Bias: The analysis may lean toward established markets, with emerging economies potentially experiencing different dynamics.

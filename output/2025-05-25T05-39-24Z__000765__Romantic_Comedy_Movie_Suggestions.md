### **Modern Romantic Comedies with Depth**

### **If You Want More Cross-Cultural / Real-Life Inspiration**

|-------|------------------|
| **The Farewell (2019)** | Not a romance, but if you liked *The Big Sick* for its cultural themes and emotion, this is beautiful. |
| **The Lunchbox (2013)** | A quiet, epistolary romance in Mumbai—moving, human, and tender. |
| **Love Sonia (2018)** | Much heavier, but for a gritty real-world story with emotional depth (only if you're in that headspace). |

Would you like to filter further—like more focus on awkward first dates, multicultural stories, or ones based on true events?

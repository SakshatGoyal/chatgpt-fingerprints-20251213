# CEO Decision-Making Research Framework

## You (2025-04-25T01:34:10.968431+00:00)

You will be given:

- A **Persona**
- A **Purpose**
- A fixed **PESS Framework** (a structured set of research modules)

Your task is to **transform the generic PESS modules** into a set of **contextually rich, creatively framed, and purpose-driven research prompts**. These questions will guide a human research team in gathering the most relevant and nuanced material needed to emulate the persona effectively for the stated purpose.

### ✳️ Inputs:

- **Persona**: CEO at a midsized company
- **Purpose**: To ask questions in order to understand the following


🧠 Three Strategic Categories + Questions
🟦 Category 1 – How they Make Decisions
Question #	Question
Question 1	How do they assess when to act decisively with limited information versus waiting for more clarity — and what gives them confidence in that moment?
Question 2	What distinguishes high-stakes from low-stakes decisions in an executive’s mind, and how does that shape who makes the call, how fast, and with what level of rigor?
Question 3	When strategies underperform or conditions shift, how do they decide whether to stay the course, pivot, or reverse earlier choices?
Question 4	What internal and external inputs — from data to advisors to culture — do they weigh most heavily when making strategic decisions, and how do those priorities shift by context?
Question 5	How do they balance short-term pressures with long-term vision — especially when resources are limited or the stakes are high?
Question 6	In what ways do company size and stage (startup, scale-up, enterprise) shape how they make, delegate, and scale decisions?
Question 7	How do they in different industries or organizational cultures approach strategic decision-making differently — and what hidden assumptions shape their style?
(or , “Final category assignment - Category 1 + Category 2” depending on the outcome)
🟨 Category 2 – Challenges in Decision-Making
Question #	Question
Question 1	What makes certain strategic decisions especially difficult for they, and how do they navigate uncertainty, internal resistance, or second-guessing in those moments?
Question 2	What are the most common internal bottlenecks or sources of friction that slow down or derail strategic decisions — from misalignment and politics to culture and stakeholder dynamics?
Question 3	How do they weigh competing priorities and trade-offs when strategic goals conflict — and what frameworks or instincts guide those choices?
Question 4	What external forces — such as investors, regulators, customers, or the market — exert the most pressure on decision-making, and how do they respond when those pressures conflict with internal priorities or long-term vision?
Question 5	When faced with disruption — whether from new technologies or market shifts — how do they decide whether to stay the course or pivot, and what signals do they trust most in making that call?
Question 6	How do challenges in decision-making differ between small, fast-moving companies and large, complex enterprises — and what lessons do they carry between those contexts?
Question 7	What concerns they most during the transition from strategy formulation to execution, and how do they ensure strategic intent survives operational realities?
🟩 Category 3 – AI’s Role in Executive Decision-Making
Question #	Question
Question 1	What makes AI feel like a trusted strategic companion, rather than a tool—especially when the stakes are high and data is incomplete?
Question 2	How have past experiences—positive or negative—influenced how they think about using AI for strategic decision support today?
Question 3	What kinds of decisions or thought processes do they instinctively reserve for themselves—and why?
Question 4	How do they assess the quality, bias, or relevance of AI-generated insights—especially when they lack proprietary grounding but draw on public or market data?
Question 5	In what ways do they want AI to challenge their assumptions, not just echo them—and what would respectful challenge look like?
Question 6	What mental workflows or thinking rituals could AI most naturally plug into—without disrupting the flow or introducing friction?
Question 7	What kinds of strategic thinking or planning frameworks feel like a natural fit for AI support—and where does AI’s role begin to break down?

    ## 📝 PESS Research Guide: [Persona] for [Purpose]

    ### 1. Persona Definition (Who)
    Select relevant modules:
    - [ ] Identity Basics
    - [ ] Tone & Style
    - [ ] Behavioral Patterns
    - [ ] Values & Motivations
    - [ ] Exemplars & Anecdotes
    - [ ] Domain Competence *(optional)*

    ### 2. Purpose Definition (What For)
    Clearly identify your primary use-case modules:
    - [ ] Emotional & Social Guidance
    - [ ] Strategic & Analytical Reasoning
    - [ ] Creative & Expressive Tasks
    - [ ] Procedural & Functional Tasks
    - [ ] Moral & Ethical Reasoning

    ### 3. Recommended Information-Gathering Sources
    Based on chosen modules, gather from:
    - Primary sources (e.g., interviews, writings by persona)
    - Secondary sources (biographies, critical analysis)
    - Fictional canon (scripts, character wikis, authoritative sources)

    **Example:**
    If "Emotional & Social Guidance" selected → memoir excerpts, personal anecdotes, interviews reflecting values.

    If "Procedural & Functional Tasks" selected → step-by-step descriptions, documented decision processes, case-studies.

    ### 4. Specific Information to Include
    Prioritize gathering:
    - Authentic examples closely tied to persona’s demonstrated behavior
    - Explicit declarations of values, priorities, motivations
    - Demonstrated reasoning processes (if relevant to task)

    ### 5. Pitfalls & What to Avoid
    - Avoid assumptions of competence based solely on fame or presence in a domain.
    - Beware user-added ideological biases; cross-check authenticity.
    - Do not assume fictional logic applies to real-world tasks.

    ### 6. Depth and Fidelity Target
    - Clearly define the depth required:
      **High (exact voice replication)** → Rich exemplars & anecdotes, detailed style & tone guides.
      **Medium (style-aware, flexible)** → Values, general patterns, some exemplars.
      **Low (loose imitation)** → Identity basics, core values only.

    ### 7. Hidden Assumptions & Risk Mitigation
    - Identify assumptions in chosen persona’s public image vs. reality.
    - Check cultural bias in collected sources.
    - Prepare fallback instructions for handling uncertainty (style drift, hallucination).

    ### 🔄 Final Checklist (Before Use)
    - Confirm fidelity matches task requirement.
    - Confirm adequate factual grounding for purpose.
    - Confirm inclusion of modular packs matches intended complexity and depth.

### 🎯 Objective:

Transform each *selected* PESS module into a **set of exploratory, research-ready questions** that are:

- Tailored to the Persona and Purpose
- Specific and deep enough to guide meaningful, grounded research
- Framed creatively—favoring open-ended, imaginative, or situational language
- Sensitive to personal, behavioral, and cultural nuance
- Free from clichés and generalizations

---

### 🧩 Instructions:

1. **Only consider the PESS modules marked with `[x]`**.

    Ignore those marked with `[ ]` or not selected.

2. **For each selected module**, generate 1–10 high-quality exploratory questions.

    Prioritize **depth, relevance, and contextual grounding** over quantity.

    If only one great question emerges, that’s better than five generic ones.

3. **Frame the questions in a creative, open-ended style** that invites nuanced research.

    Use formats like:

    - “What might {{Persona}} say if…”
    - “Are there examples of situations where…”
    - “How has {{Persona}} responded to…”
    - “In what ways has {{Persona}} demonstrated…”
    - “What real-life moments reflect {{Persona}}’s view on…”
4. **Incorporate the lens of the stated Purpose.**

    Shape each question so it uncovers information directly useful for fulfilling the end-goal.

5. **Adapt based on the Fidelity Target** (if present in the PESS):
    - For **High Fidelity** → Ask for quotes, anecdotes, precise language, voice tone
    - For **Medium Fidelity** → Ask about patterns, values, reasoning styles
    - For **Low Fidelity** → Ask about identity basics and general worldview
6. **You may connect insights across modules if it enhances the questions’ relevance or depth.**

    Overlap is acceptable if it strengthens contextual integrity.

7. **Do not answer the questions.**

    Only generate the questions themselves.

8. **Optional but encouraged:**

    Where helpful, recommend the most suitable source types (e.g., memoirs, interviews, public speeches) for each question.

```CopyEdit
## Research Objective: Find empirical information to help create a custom GPT of a CEO at a midsized company for shaping incisive questions about executive decision-making and AI’s emerging role.

### Identity Basics
- What pivotal early-career moments (a first turnaround, a botched product launch, a breakout win) does the CEO themselves credit for sharpening their strategic instincts—and how do they narrate those events today? *Suggested sources: long-form interviews, autobiographical talks*
- How has the shift from hands-on operator to enterprise-level strategist changed the way they define “success” for both themselves and the firm?
- When asked about company size—neither startup-lean nor mega-corp—how do they articulate the unique freedoms and constraints of the “midsized middle”?
- What personal rituals (morning briefings, walking one-on-ones, private note-taking systems) reveal how this CEO primes themselves for high-stakes calls?

### Tone & Style
- In shareholder letters versus internal town-halls, what linguistic cues (metaphors, cadence, humor) signal when the CEO is rallying, warning, or experimenting? *Suggested sources: earnings-call transcripts, Slack AMA logs*
- How does their verbal style shift when defending a risky move to a skeptical board compared with mentoring a rising executive?
- Are there signature phrases that consistently surface when they speak about uncertainty, AI adoption, or strategic pivots?
- How do they use silence, questioning, or storytelling to steer tough discussions—especially under time pressure?

### Behavioral Patterns
- Map three recent strategic junctures (e.g., supply-chain shock, sudden M&A opportunity, AI-driven product shift). How did the CEO’s sequence of actions differ across each context?
- When data remains murky, what “gut-check” behaviors emerge (e.g., convening an ad-hoc brain-trust, asking for worst-case scenarios first)?
- How does the CEO toggle between centralized and distributed decision rights as stakes rise or timelines shrink?
- What patterns surface in their post-mortems after a strategy underperforms—do they spotlight process flaws, talent gaps, or blind spots in their own judgment?

### Values & Motivations
- Which long-term ideals (brand legacy, workforce resilience, community impact) consistently outweigh quarter-to-quarter pressures in their narratives?
- How do they articulate the trade-off between “playing to win” and “protecting the downside” when cash flow tightens?
- When speaking about AI’s promise, do they frame it primarily as competitive edge, cultural transformation, or ethical obligation?
- In moments of public scrutiny, which values do they elevate first—and which stay noticeably quiet?

### Exemplars & Anecdotes
- Collect first-person stories where the CEO reversed an earlier decision; what tipping-point detail finally forced the U-turn?
- Gather anecdotes of AI experiments that fizzled: how did they publicly explain the failure, and what lesson became the headline?
- Identify instances where a mid-level manager’s insight swayed a major strategy; how does the CEO retell that power-shift?
- Seek examples of “decisive inaction”—times the CEO deliberately paused rather than moved, and later justified the restraint.

### Domain Competence *(Industry & Functional)*
- What sector-specific KPIs or trendlines does the CEO cite most when framing strategic horizons (e.g., inventory turn vs. brand heat index)?
- How do they describe the clothing industry’s unique innovation cycles compared with adjacent consumer-goods fields?
- Which supply-chain or sustainability certifications do they champion—and why those over equally valid alternatives?

---

### Strategic & Analytical Reasoning
- When pressed to act with partial data, which mental models (OODA loop, option value thinking, game-theory mapping) surface in their vocabulary?
- How has exposure to AI-driven forecasting changed their default “data-first, instinct-second” ratio, if at all?
- In board discussions, how do they justify classifying a decision as “high-stakes” and thus subject to deeper diligence or narrower delegation?
- What evidence shows how the CEO weighs contrarian signals—especially when they conflict with prevailing dashboards?

### Emotional & Social Guidance
- How does the CEO coach teams through decision fatigue when multiple strategic tracks remain open?
- In what ways do they normalize dissent or designate a “devil’s advocate” when stakes soar?
- After announcing a tough pivot, what emotional frameworks (acknowledging loss, reframing purpose) do they employ to steady morale?

### Moral & Ethical Reasoning
- Cite episodes where investor pressure clashed with stated social or environmental commitments—how did the CEO arbitrate the tension?
- When deploying AI in customer-facing processes, how do they reason about bias, transparency, and consent?
- What public statements reveal the CEO’s line between strategic secrecy and stakeholder disclosure?

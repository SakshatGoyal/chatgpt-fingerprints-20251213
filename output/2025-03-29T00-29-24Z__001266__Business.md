### 🎯 **Main Goal**

Your task is to analyze how internal contradictions, tensions, or misalignments shaped executive decision-making in each module. Use the **Cognitive Contradiction Mapping** method to complete a structured table per module.

This method identifies **conflicting logics, interpretations, or priorities** that influenced decisions—even if these tensions were not resolved.

---

**Maintain the following instructions as working memory.**

---

### 🧠 **Internal Reasoning Process (Dual Lens)**

Use two reasoning lenses to guide your judgment (but do not produce separate outputs):

- **Interpretive Lens – Creative Strategist**

    Detect how ambiguity, misalignment, or shifts in narrative shaped the decision process.

- **Structural Lens – Strategic Analyst**

    Translate those insights into five structured taxonomy fields using only clear textual evidence or strong implication.


Do not output separate views for these lenses—they are internal scaffolds for reaching the final table.

---

### Input Format

Each module begins with a header like:

`CATEGORICAL MODULE [identifier]`

Example: CATEGORICAL MODULE 21 - C2-I1

Each includes:

- Insight Statement
- Executive Decision-Making Context
- Supporting Context

---

### 🧭 **Processing Instructions**

- Read the full module before tagging.
- Apply both lenses, but produce a single structured output per module.
- Repeat for **up to 30 modules per execution**.
- After 30 modules, stop and await further instruction.

### 🗂 **Field Structure & Tagging Guide**

### **1. Tension Axis**

*What two mental models or priorities are in conflict?*

| Tag | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Standardization vs. Localization** | The need for global brand consistency conflicts with the demand for culturally tailored offerings. |
| **Short-Term ROI vs. Long-Term Value** | Pressure for immediate financial returns clashes with strategic bets that deliver delayed benefits. |
| **Centralized Control vs. Decentralized Adaptation** | Executives wrestle with maintaining top-down consistency while enabling local responsiveness. |
| **Technological Integration vs. Operational Continuity** | The promise of digital upgrades is offset by disruption to current operations and legacy systems. |
| **Efficiency vs. Empathy** | Quantitative optimization challenges more qualitative, human-centered considerations (e.g., user experience, inclusivity). |
| **Data-Driven Rationality vs. Creative Risk** | Reliance on analytics conflicts with the need for unvalidated, high-impact innovations. |
| **Global Scale vs. Local Relevance** | Strategies built for scale must accommodate granular market and cultural realities. |

---

### **2. Fracture Type**

*What kind of internal contradiction is occurring?*

| Tag | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Conflicting Success Metrics** | Different teams interpret performance through competing KPIs (e.g., conversion vs. advocacy). |
| **Misaligned Temporal Horizons** | Strategic decisions are impaired by differing assumptions about timelines of success. |
| **Hidden Trade-off Costs** | Decisions appear win-win but mask deep operational or reputational costs. |
| **Data vs. Experience** | Quantitative models suggest one course of action, but qualitative insights suggest another. |
| **Belief Persistence under Contradiction** | Leaders cling to outdated assumptions despite contradictory evidence. |

---

### **3. Surface vs. Deep Contradiction**

*Is the contradiction explicitly acknowledged or latent?*

| Tag | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **explicit** | The tension is openly named in the module (e.g., “balancing global consistency with local adaptation”). |
| **implicit** | The contradiction is inferred from behavior, decision logic, or outcome patterns (e.g., over-reliance on frameworks without empirical support). |

---

### **4. Decision Outcome**

*What happened as a result of the contradiction?*

| Tag | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Strategic Reframing** | The problem was redefined to accommodate multiple priorities or resolve misalignment. |
| **Partial Implementation** | A compromise or incomplete rollout was chosen to manage internal tensions. |
| **Delayed Realignment** | Decision was postponed or phased, pending better integration of opposing logics. |
| **Local Override** | Regional or team-specific autonomy was granted despite central policy. |
| **Portfolio Diversification** | Both logics were retained by diversifying bets across multiple tracks. |
| **Toolset Expansion** | Decision expanded to include new metrics, systems, or capabilities to resolve contradictions. |

---

### **5. Organizational Implication**

*What downstream effect did the contradiction have?*

| Tag | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Strategic Ambiguity** | Teams remain unclear on which logic governs decision-making. |
| **Capability Strain** | New demands exceed existing systems, skills, or infrastructure. |
| **Cultural Friction** | Differing beliefs or values create internal tension across teams or regions. |
| **Execution Lag** | Operational delays or inefficiencies result from unresolved contradictions. |
| **Emergent Flexibility** | The contradiction produced innovation or new adaptive capabilities. |
| **Metric Misalignment** | KPIs used to track progress reflect different or incompatible priorities. |

---

### ✅ **Rules & Constraints**

✔️ **Do**

- Base all tags on textual evidence or clear implication.
- Use multiple tags per field **only** if supported.
- Include contradictions **even in “successful” cases**.
- Use `null` only when **nothing is present**, not when uncertain.

❌ **Don’t**

- Don’t infer personal motives or emotions.
- Don’t tag vague references.
- Don’t guess or extrapolate—only tag grounded contradictions.

---

### 📤 **Output Format**

For each module:

- Keep the original module header (e.g., CATEGORICAL MODULE 21 - C2-I1)
- Return a clean 2-column table below it using this format:

```
CATEGORICAL MODULE 21 - C2-I1

Field	Value
Tension Axis	local vs. global, customer vs. brand
Fracture Type	interpretation drift, timeline mismatch
Surface vs. Deep	explicit
Decision Outcome	symbolic action
Organizational Implication	partial success

```

- Enclose each full table in triple backticks (```) for clean formatting in export.

## You (2025-03-29T00:47:19.788000+00:00)

### ✅ Main Goal

Your task is to **compile previously completed Cognitive Contradiction Mapping tables into one horizontal comparison table**. This will help compare how different decision tensions unfolded across modules.

---

### 🧠 Internal Role

**You are a data-integrity compiler.**

Your job is to preserve structure, ensure consistency, and maintain exact field formatting—**without reinterpreting any values**. This is a transformation task, not an analysis.

---

### 📥 Input

You are given multiple per-module tables from earlier outputs. Each table includes:

- A header line (e.g., `CATEGORICAL MODULE` 21 - C2-I1)
- Five fields:
    - Tension Axis
    - Fracture Type
    - Surface vs. Deep
    - Decision Outcome
    - Organizational Implication

---

### 🧭 Instructions

- Extract the **module ID** from the header (e.g., from `CATEGORICAL MODULE` 21 - C2-I1, use 21 - C2-I1).
- Keep **all field values exactly as originally written**—no paraphrasing or substitutions.
- Normalize tags for consistency:
    - Use **lowercase**
    - Format multi-tag fields as **comma-separated** with no spaces

---

### ✅ Do’s and Don’ts

### ✔️ Do:

- Preserve exact tag values from each module table
- Format all fields in lowercase, comma-separated values
- One row per module
- Include full, exact Module ID

### ❌ Don’t:

- Don’t reinterpret or adjust field content
- Don’t omit or skip modules
- Don’t use Markdown tables or headers

---

### 📤 Required Output Format (CSV Mode)

Output one **CSV-formatted** line per module using this exact column order:

`Module ID, Tension Axis, Fracture Type, Surface vs. Deep, Decision Outcome, Organizational Implication`

Include headers. Each row should look like:

Output the final result as a **Markdown table** wrapped in triple backticks:

```
| Module ID | Tension Axis | Fracture Type | Surface vs. Deep | Decision Outcome | Organizational Implication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RQ-1_12 | local vs. global, customer vs. brand | interpretation drift | explicit | symbolic action | partial success |
| RQ-1_19 | efficiency vs. learning | data conflict | implicit | delayed | residual tension |

rewrite the above response by keeping the following things in mind

- rewrite it in a way that i can copy it into notion as a table
- identify any duplicate rows and remove them.
- Concatenate the term 'CATEGORICAL MODULE ' (extra space at the end is intentional) at the beginning of every cell in first column, except the header.
- capitalize all characters in first column

at the end, if there were duplicates, give me a count of the duplicate row values. If there were no rows, just say there were no duplicates.

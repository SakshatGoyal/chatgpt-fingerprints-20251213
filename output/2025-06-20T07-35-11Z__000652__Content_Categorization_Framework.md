# Content Categorization Framework

## You (2025-06-20T07:35:11.443000+00:00)

Hey, so for your context, we were working on this research project where I had a bunch of content modules that had specific insights on strategy, like challenges around them, specific approaches that people take in different industries, and so on and so forth. So one challenge we were trying to overcome is that we were trying to group them based on type of strategy, like whether it's business level or corporate or functional strategy or whatever type of strategy it was, we were trying to sort them. So I essentially built almost like a data pipeline, but it's not technically a data pipeline. It's basically like creating a very structured set of evaluation matrix that I could feed into ChatGPT, and based on that matrix, I was able to have ChatGPT quantifiably sort each content module into their respective buckets. Now, this is my approach. I need you to refine this approach into two sentences that I could use to explain the process without necessarily oversimplifying it or taking away from what the process actually was about.

Here’s a refined version of your approach in two sentences:

"I designed a structured evaluation framework that systematically analyzes the defining features of each content module—such as strategic focus, scope, and industry context—and uses those criteria to categorize them into distinct strategy types like business-level, corporate, or functional. This framework served as a semi-automated pipeline, enabling ChatGPT to apply consistent, quantifiable logic to accurately sort the modules at scale." 

Would you like a more casual or more technical version as well?

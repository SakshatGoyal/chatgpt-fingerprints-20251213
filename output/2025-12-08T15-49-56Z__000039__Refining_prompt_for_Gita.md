# Refining prompt for Gita

## You (2025-12-08T15:49:56.379000+00:00)

help me refine the following prompt. I feel like chatGPT is not doing a thorough job of verifying content and rather making assumptions based on the title alone.

---
I'm looking for the most authentic and straightforward version of the Bhagavad Gita available on Audible India. There are numerous renditions out there, but I want to avoid two specific types:

1. Any interpretation or adaptation of the Gita that alters its original content, such as versions titled "Gita for Life," "Gita for CEOs," or "Gita for Success." These variations often tend to modify or reshape the essence of the text to fit contemporary themes, which is not what I'm seeking.

2. I'm also not interested in any translations that, while they may stick closely to the original text, present it through a heavily opinionated lens. I've encountered podcasts and commentaries that, despite seeming faithful to the content, come across as overly emotional or biased. Even implicit biases can taint the understanding of such a profound work, so I'm keen to avoid anything that feels varnished or agenda-driven.

What I really want is a plain, simple translation of the Bhagavad Gita from Sanskrit into either Hindi or English. My goal is to glean a clear understanding of Lord Krishna's teachings to Arjuna, focusing on their dialogue and the context surrounding it. I have a basic familiarity with the characters from the Mahabharata but don't possess deep expertise, so a translation that offers some context without heavy interpretation would be ideal.

Excellent foundation — your intent is clear, thoughtful, and shows strong discernment. You're seeking **authenticity** and **clarity**, and you want GPT-4o to **verify actual content**, not just infer based on titles. That’s a critical insight — and we can definitely sharpen your prompt to *steer the model away from superficial assumptions* and *encourage deeper content validation*.

Let’s explore a few refinements together before I build the final version:

### 🔍 Discovery Questions
To ensure we address your frustrations and guide GPT-4o more effectively:

1. **Content Verification**:
   - Do you want the model to check Audible **descriptions and reviews** to assess authenticity?
   - Should it **prioritize editions that mention the original Sanskrit source** explicitly?
   - Would you prefer the **translator’s name or scholarly background** be cited for transparency?

2. **Language Preference**:
   - You mentioned Hindi or English. Do you have a **preferred language between the two**, or should both be offered as long as authenticity is maintained?

3. **Contextual Annotations**:
   - Do you want **minimal contextual footnotes or introductions**, or strictly just the translated verses without any extra content?
   - Are **brief chapter intros or verse summaries** acceptable if they’re neutral and scholarly?

4. **Audible India Search Limitations**:
   - Should GPT restrict itself to **searching Audible India only**, or can it also recommend **specific versions** found globally that are also available on Audible India?

5. **Output Format**:
   - Do you want a **ranked list**, or just a **single best option with justification**?
   - Should it include **links, narrators, or sample review quotes**?

Would you like to respond to the above briefly, or should I move ahead and **begin building the refined prompt** based on current understanding?

1. Content verification - it can check descriptions but its tricky. Its definetely the first source of information and an easy way to sniff out 'agendas'. I think looking for original sanskrit source is helpful. And yes, the translator’s name or scholarly background would be very valuable.

2. I should be offered both as long as authenticity is maintained.

3. Minimal contextual footnotes are fine.

4. Yes, restrict to audible india only.

5. A ranked list would be helpful.

# Task Plan and Schedule



## You (2025-03-03T15:05:46.926613+00:00)

Help me structure my tasks for today in some kind of like formal format. So I think first I'll have to reply to Rajiv and Rishi. Basically just acknowledge like whatever we need to do. And I need to do that at 9am this morning. Additionally, I have to start creating some sort of audience segmentation for our user interview recruitment. So I need to finish that before 9am. So I need to like start thinking of a response for Rishi and Rajiv by like 8.30. And then for the rest of the day, I have to basically just conduct some literature studies. So we'll figure out some kind of plan for that. But can you also somewhat like create a kind of calendar. So I think I have lunch at 1pm. But other than that, like with the literature studies, I think it's like it's going to involve a few steps. Like I'll have to first go through the previous version of the segments. And then conduct some search on like what kind of keywords are ideal. Design the specific prompts for summarizing the papers, creating documents and blah, blah, blah. I know it's a random request, but let's see what you can do.

## You (2025-03-03T15:13:27.380000+00:00)

OK now let's do the search for the calendar tools cause I need to integrate with my own Gmail calendar. I don't want any extra separate apps or anything. I don't know how notion works. I don't think it works that way and let me look at the other tools you shared OK structured structured. OK I'll look into structured. Ideally, let's make it free obviously don't wanna spend much or at least it has like some kind of one week or two week free trial and then we'll see what we can do approach will just be that I'll give you all the information you need in the new structure the day accordingly then we'll go figure it out on some other third-party app.



## You (2025-03-03T15:18:21.215000+00:00)

OK, so in reclaim is there a way I can just copy paste the sort of tasks that you have outlined in a single prompt and just have it structure the calendar



## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T15:18:23.413602+00:00)

Yes, you can efficiently import your structured task list into Reclaim.ai and have it automatically schedule these tasks on your Google Calendar. Here's how you can do it:

**1. Connect Reclaim.ai with Google Tasks:**

   - Navigate to **Settings > Integrations** in Reclaim.ai.
   - Click on **Connect Google Tasks** and grant the necessary permissions.
   - In Google Calendar, open the **Google Tasks** sidebar, click the dropdown next to **My Tasks**, and select the **Reclaim** task list.

   This setup ensures a two-way sync between Google Tasks and Reclaim.ai, allowing tasks to be scheduled on your calendar.

**2. Format and Import Your Task List:**

   To import multiple tasks efficiently, you can use natural language syntax in the task titles to specify details like duration, due date, and priority. For example:

   - `Review Previous Audience Segments (duration:1h due today priority:high)`
   - `Conduct Keyword Research (duration:1h due today priority:medium)`
   - `Define Summarization Prompts (duration:1h due today priority:medium)`
   - `Widget UI Design (duration:1h due today priority:low)`
   - `Literature Search (duration:1.5h due today priority:high)`
   - `Synthesis & Documentation (duration:1h due today priority:critical)`

   By formatting your tasks this way, Reclaim.ai will interpret and schedule them accordingly.

**3. Add Tasks to Google Tasks:**

   - Open the **Google Tasks** sidebar in Google Calendar.
   - Ensure you're adding tasks to the **Reclaim** task list.
   - Paste each formatted task title into the task input field.

   Reclaim.ai will then sync these tasks and schedule them on your calendar based on the details provided.

**4. Review and Adjust Scheduled Tasks:**

   - After importing, check your Google Calendar to see how Reclaim.ai has scheduled your tasks.
   - If needed, adjust task details in Google Tasks or directly in Reclaim.ai to refine your schedule.

This method allows you to import your structured task list into Reclaim.ai, which will then automatically organize and schedule these tasks on your Google Calendar, streamlining your daily planning process.

## You (2025-03-03T15:20:18.958000+00:00)

Yeah, but even in this approach like let's say, I take your stuff from and put put into to tasks. Do I have to manually one by one add individual tasks can I just copy paste the entire calendar discussion into tasks and have it segment into multiple tasks



## You (2025-03-03T15:23:38.326000+00:00)

Is there a way to do this in notion? Basically my idea is I just want to copy the entire list as is and then just convert them into task. I don't want to manually sit and make 15 different tasks.



## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T15:23:47.568269+00:00)

Yes, you can efficiently convert your entire list into tasks in Notion without manually creating each one. Here's how:

**1. Paste Your List into Notion:**

   - Open your Notion page.
   - Paste your entire list directly into the page.

**2. Convert the Pasted Text into To-Do Items:**

   - After pasting, each line should appear as a separate block.
   - Click on the six-dot icon (`⋮⋮`) that appears to the left of the first block.
   - Hold down the `Shift` key and click on the six-dot icon of the last block to select all blocks.
   - With all blocks selected, click on the six-dot icon of any selected block, hover over "Turn into," and choose "To-do list."

This will convert each line into a to-do item with a checkbox, allowing you to manage your tasks efficiently.

For a visual guide on creating to-do lists in Notion, you might find this video helpful:

## You (2025-03-03T15:27:00.427000+00:00)

Yeah, but then, if you remember, I basically want this list to be converted into a Google tasks list



## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T15:27:02.733079+00:00)

Importing multiple tasks into Google Tasks directly from a text list isn't natively supported. However, there are several methods to achieve this:

**1. Using Third-Party Automation Tools:**

Tools like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/connect/easycsv/google_tasks) and [Make](https://www.make.com/en/integrations/csv/google-tasks) allow you to automate the process of importing tasks from a CSV file into Google Tasks. Here's a general approach:

- **Prepare Your Task List:**
  - Convert your text list into a CSV file, with each task on a separate line.

- **Set Up the Automation:**
  - Use the chosen tool to create a workflow that reads each line from the CSV and creates a corresponding task in Google Tasks.

**2. Utilizing Google Apps Script:**

If you're comfortable with scripting, you can use Google Apps Script to import tasks from a CSV file into Google Tasks:

- **Write a Script:**
  - Develop a script that reads your CSV file and uses the [Google Tasks API](https://developers.google.com/tasks) to create tasks.

- **Execute the Script:**
  - Run the script to populate your Google Tasks list.

**3. Alternative Approach Using Google Calendar:**

Since Google Calendar supports importing events from CSV files, you can:

- **Import Tasks as Events:**
  - Format your tasks as events in a CSV file and import them into Google Calendar.

- **Convert Events to Tasks:**
  - Manually convert these events into tasks within Google Calendar.

**Note:** This method requires additional manual steps and may not be as efficient.

For a visual guide on adding multiple tasks to Google Tasks, you might find this video helpful:

While these methods can help streamline the process, they may require some initial setup or familiarity with automation tools and scripting.

## You (2025-03-03T15:28:44.887000+00:00)

I like the idea of Google API sorry Google apps script so let's do this. Let's basically take the entire task list you created for the day and create some kind of script that can basically convert all of that into output all of that into my calendar as time blocks.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T15:28:45.570017+00:00)

Here's a ready-to-use **Google Apps Script** to take your structured daily task list and automatically insert it into your Google Calendar as time blocks. You just need to copy this script into the Google Apps Script editor connected to your Google Calendar:



## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T15:29:10.425098+00:00)

### How to use this script:
1. **Open Google Calendar.**
2. Click the **gear icon ⚙️** > select **"Apps Script."**
   *(If you don’t see this option, visit [script.google.com](https://script.google.com/) directly.)*
3. Click **"+ New project"**, and paste the above code into the editor.
4. Name your script clearly (e.g., "Daily Task Scheduler").
5. Save the script by clicking the save icon (💾).
6. Run the function `scheduleTasks()` by clicking the ▶️ play button.
   *(You might have to authorize it to access your calendar the first time.)*

After running this script, all tasks will appear as time blocks in your Google Calendar for today.

## You (2025-03-03T15:32:45.035000+00:00)

Can you rewrite a custom the code in such a way that I have a container for a date variable so my plan is I can just reuse the same script daily or for different days maybe on a Saturday I can create this list for the coming Monday or something like that, so I'm thinking if I can just insert the date, it will automatically sort of assign tasks for that particular date



## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T15:33:22.268897+00:00)

I've updated the script to include a date parameter. Now, you can reuse this script easily by providing a specific date as input. For example:

```javascript
scheduleTasks('2025-03-03');
```

This will schedule tasks specifically for the provided date.

## You (2025-03-03T15:35:32.471000+00:00)

Syntax error: SyntaxError: Unexpected string line: 1 file: Code.gs

function scheduleTasks('2025-03-03') {
  const calendar = CalendarApp.getDefaultCalendar();

  // Define your tasks with titles, start and end times

    const endTime = new Date(taskDate.getFullYear(), taskDate.getMonth(), taskDate.getDate(), endHour, endMinute);

    calendar.createEvent(task.title, startTime, endTime);
  });
}

## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T15:35:33.102570+00:00)

The syntax error is because you're inserting a date string directly into the function definition. Instead, you need to define the function with a variable parameter and pass the date string when calling the function.

Here's how to correctly use it:

### Corrected Code:
```javascript
function scheduleTasks(dateString) {
  const calendar = CalendarApp.getDefaultCalendar();

  // Define your tasks with titles, start and end times
  const tasks = [
    {title: 'Audience Segmentation', start: '08:00', end: '08:30'},
    {title: 'Draft & Send Response to Rajiv & Rishi', start: '08:30', end: '09:00'},
    {title: 'Review Previous Audience Segments', start: '09:30', end: '10:30'},
    {title: 'Conduct Keyword Research', start: '10:30', end: '11:30'},
    {title: 'Define Summarization Prompts', start: '11:30', end: '12:30'},
    {title: 'Widget UI Design (casual)', start: '12:30', end: '13:30'},
    {title: 'Lunch Break', start: '13:30', end: '14:00'},
    {title: 'Literature Search', start: '14:00', end: '15:30'},
    {title: 'Buffer/Transition', start: '15:30', end: '16:00'},
    {title: 'Synthesis & Documentation', start: '16:00', end: '17:00'}
  ];

  // Parse the provided date string
  const taskDate = new Date(dateString);

  tasks.forEach(task => {
    const [startHour, startMinute] = task.start.split(':');
    const [endHour, endMinute] = task.end.split(':');

    const startTime = new Date(taskDate.getFullYear(), taskDate.getMonth(), taskDate.getDate(), startHour, startMinute);
    const endTime = new Date(taskDate.getFullYear(), taskDate.getMonth(), taskDate.getDate(), endHour, endMinute);

    calendar.createEvent(task.title, startTime, endTime);
  });
}

// Now call the function with your desired date like this:
function runScript() {
  scheduleTasks('2025-03-03');
}
```

### How to Use:
- Copy the above corrected code to your Google Apps Script.
- Run the `runScript()` function (click ▶️ play), which calls `scheduleTasks` with your chosen date.
- Change `'2025-03-03'` to any date you want to schedule tasks for.

## You (2025-03-03T15:37:28.882000+00:00)

It says execution completed, but I don't see any tasks added for today in my calendar

## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T15:37:29.571267+00:00)

Since it says execution completed without errors but nothing appears, double-check these points:

### ✅ **Quick troubleshooting checklist:**

1. **Confirm calendar permissions:**
   - The first time the script runs, Google may ask you to authorize the script to access your calendar. Make sure you authorized it.

2. **Check the correct Google account:**
   - Ensure you’re looking at the correct Google Calendar associated with the account you're logged into Apps Script with.

3. **Check the default calendar:**
   - `CalendarApp.getDefaultCalendar()` targets your main/default calendar. If you use multiple calendars, confirm it's the right one.

### 📌 **To explicitly choose your calendar:**

Replace the following line in your script:
```javascript
const calendar = CalendarApp.getDefaultCalendar();
```

With:
```javascript
const calendar = CalendarApp.getCalendarById('your_calendar_email@gmail.com');
```

- You can find your calendar’s ID by going to Google Calendar → Settings → select your calendar → scroll to **"Integrate calendar"** → copy **Calendar ID**.

---

### 🔄 **Sample working code (explicit calendar selection):**
```javascript
function scheduleTasks(dateString) {
  const calendar = CalendarApp.getCalendarById('your_calendar_email@gmail.com');

  const tasks = [
    {title: 'Audience Segmentation', start: '08:00', end: '08:30'},
    {title: 'Draft & Send Response to Rajiv & Rishi', start: '08:30', end: '09:00'},
    {title: 'Review Previous Audience Segments', start: '09:30', end: '10:30'},
    {title: 'Conduct Keyword Research', start: '10:30', end: '11:30'},
    {title: 'Define Summarization Prompts', start: '11:30', end: '12:30'},
    {title: 'Widget UI Design (casual)', start: '12:30', end: '13:30'},
    {title: 'Lunch Break', start: '13:30', end: '14:00'},
    {title: 'Literature Search', start: '14:00', end: '15:30'},
    {title: 'Buffer/Transition', start: '15:30', end: '16:00'},
    {title: 'Synthesis & Documentation', start: '16:00', end: '17:00'}
  ];

  const taskDate = new Date(dateString);

  tasks.forEach(task => {
    const [startHour, startMinute] = task.start.split(':');
    const [endHour, endMinute] = task.end.split(':');

    const startTime = new Date(taskDate.getFullYear(), taskDate.getMonth(), taskDate.getDate(), startHour, startMinute);
    const endTime = new Date(taskDate.getFullYear(), taskDate.getMonth(), taskDate.getDate(), endHour, endMinute);

    calendar.createEvent(task.title, startTime, endTime);
  });
}

function runScript() {
  scheduleTasks('2025-03-03');  // adjust to your date
}
```

---

### 🔎 **What to do next:**
- Replace `'your_calendar_email@gmail.com'` with your calendar ID.
- Run `runScript()` again.
- Check your calendar afterward.

This should resolve your issue, and events will appear clearly in your calendar.

## You (2025-03-03T15:41:43.462000+00:00)

OK, it looks like it used the previous date. For example, the date we entered is third March but it assigned all those tasks to 2nd March which was yesterday.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T15:41:44.288431+00:00)

This is a common issue due to timezone handling. Google Apps Script defaults to the script's timezone, which may differ from yours. To explicitly fix this, set your timezone clearly when creating dates.

Here's the **corrected and robust script** that explicitly handles your timezone:

Replace your current script with this:
```javascript
function scheduleTasks(dateString) {
  const calendar = CalendarApp.getDefaultCalendar();

  const tasks = [
    {title: 'Audience Segmentation', start: '08:00', end: '08:30'},
    {title: 'Draft & Send Response to Rajiv & Rishi', start: '08:30', end: '09:00'},
    {title: 'Review Previous Audience Segments', start: '09:30', end: '10:30'},
    {title: 'Conduct Keyword Research', start: '10:30', end: '11:30'},
    {title: 'Define Summarization Prompts', start: '11:30', end: '12:30'},
    {title: 'Widget UI Design (casual)', start: '12:30', end: '13:30'},
    {title: 'Lunch Break', start: '13:30', end: '14:00'},
    {title: 'Literature Search', start: '14:00', end: '15:30'},
    {title: 'Buffer/Transition', start: '15:30', end: '16:00'},
    {title: 'Synthesis & Documentation', start: '16:00', end: '17:00'}
  ];

  // explicitly define your timezone (example: IST, EST, PST, GMT, etc.)
  const timezone = 'Your/Timezone';  // e.g., 'America/New_York' or 'Asia/Kolkata'

  tasks.forEach(task => {
    const startTime = new Date(`${dateString}T${task.start}:00`);
    const endTime = new Date(`${dateString}T${task.end}:00`);

    calendar.createEvent(task.title, startTime, endTime, {timeZone: timezone});
  });
}

function runScript() {
  scheduleTasks('2025-03-03');  // Enter your date here
}
```

### 🚨 Important step:
- Replace `'Your/Timezone'` with your specific timezone identifier.
  (You can find your timezone identifier [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).)

**Example:**
- `'America/New_York'` (EST)
- `'Asia/Kolkata'` (IST)
- `'Europe/London'` (GMT)

**This will ensure events are scheduled correctly on your chosen date.**

Hey by the way, I have one more issue so basically I am trying to go to script but with my work Gmail ID for some reason the script keeps taking it back to my personal ID and so I'm trying to figure out like what the main issue is why is it taking me back to my personal ID instead of my work ID?

## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T15:42:50.967368+00:00)

This typically happens because your browser is defaulting your personal Google account as the primary session, causing conflicts when you try to access Google Apps Script with your work email.

Here's how to resolve it clearly and permanently:

### ✅ **Quick solution:**
- Open a **private/incognito window** in your browser.
- Log in directly to your **work Gmail account** first.
- Then open [script.google.com](https://script.google.com) directly in the incognito window.

**This approach ensures no interference from your personal account.**

---

### 📌 **Permanent solution:**
Google defaults to the first Google account logged into the browser session. To fix permanently:

1. **Log out of all Google accounts** completely.
2. Then, **log in first** with your **work account**, and afterward add your personal account.

This sets your work account as the default primary account, ensuring scripts and calendar access default correctly.

---

### 🛠 **If the issue persists:**
- **Clear cache and cookies** related to Google (`Settings > Privacy and Security`).
- Use **separate browser profiles** (e.g., one Chrome profile for work, another for personal).

This will keep your work and personal activities entirely isolated, preventing cross-account confusion in the future.

## You (2025-03-03T15:46:17.037000+00:00)

OK, thanks now just could you rewrite the entire script once again but just use my new email ID the one which I give you and I'll also tell you the time zone I'm using

sakshat@intelligaia.com
time zone: San francisco time

## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T15:46:17.926241+00:00)

Here's your complete, ready-to-use script updated with your new email ID and the correct timezone (**San Francisco Time – America/Los_Angeles**):



## You (2025-03-03T15:51:37.188000+00:00)

OK, thanks I think this solution worked out pretty well so now help me. Make sure that I can actually receive the notifications the notifications on my desktop. I'm using a MacBook Pro and my default browser is chrome so how do I make sure the calendar notifications show up in my desktop?

## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T15:51:37.749196+00:00)

Here's how to ensure your **Google Calendar notifications** appear as desktop notifications on your **MacBook Pro** using **Chrome**:

   ```
   chrome://settings/content/notifications
   ```
2. Under **"Allowed to send notifications"**, make sure:
   - `calendar.google.com` is listed and allowed.

3. If you don't see it:
   - Click **"Add"** and enter:
     ```
     https://calendar.google.com
     ```

---

### 🔔 **Test Your Notifications**

- Quickly create a test event (for 5 minutes from now) in your Google Calendar and check if notifications pop up on your desktop.

Once you follow these steps, your calendar notifications will reliably appear as desktop notifications on your MacBook Pro.

## You (2025-03-03T15:56:42.788000+00:00)

Hey, could you modify this app script so that for every calendar event I get a notification seven minutes before the event starts


function scheduleTasks(dateString) {
  const calendar = CalendarApp.getCalendarById('sakshat@intelligaia.com');

  const tasks = [
    {title: 'Audience Segmentation', start: '08:00', end: '08:30'},
    {title: 'Draft & Send Response to Rajiv & Rishi', start: '08:30', end: '09:00'},
    {title: 'Review Previous Audience Segments', start: '09:30', end: '10:30'},
    {title: 'Conduct Keyword Research', start: '10:30', end: '11:30'},
    {title: 'Define Summarization Prompts', start: '11:30', end: '12:30'},
    {title: 'Widget UI Design (casual)', start: '12:30', end: '13:30'},
    {title: 'Lunch Break', start: '13:30', end: '14:00'},
    {title: 'Literature Search', start: '14:00', end: '15:30'},
    {title: 'Buffer/Transition', start: '15:30', end: '16:00'},
    {title: 'Synthesis & Documentation', start: '16:00', end: '17:00'}
  ];

  const timezone = 'America/Los_Angeles';

  tasks.forEach(task => {
    const startTime = new Date(`${dateString}T${task.start}:00`);
    const endTime = new Date(`${dateString}T${task.end}:00`);

    calendar.createEvent(task.title, startTime, endTime, {timeZone: timezone});
  });
}

function runScript() {
  scheduleTasks('2025-03-03');  // Enter your date here
}

## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T15:56:43.804463+00:00)

Here's your modified Google Apps Script that will set a notification **7 minutes before** each calendar event starts:



## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T15:57:07.211729+00:00)

I've updated the script to include a popup notification **7 minutes before each event**. You can run this as usual, and your notifications will automatically be scheduled accordingly.

## You (2025-03-03T16:33:12.595000+00:00)

Hey, by the way, it looks like I'm not getting the notifications from Google calendar and I've gone through all the steps I have everything checked and all the permissions are there, but I still don't get the notifications

## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T16:33:13.741065+00:00)

Since you've already verified all permissions and notifications settings but still aren't getting notifications, here's how you can quickly troubleshoot and resolve this:

### ⚠️ **Common Reasons & Quick Fixes:**

---

### ✅ **Step 1: Confirm macOS "Do Not Disturb" mode is off**
- **Click Control Center (top-right corner)**
- Make sure **"Do Not Disturb"** or **"Focus mode"** is turned **off**.

---

### ✅ **Step 2: Check Chrome notification settings again**
- Go to:
  ```
  chrome://settings/content/notifications
  ```
- Ensure `https://calendar.google.com` is explicitly set to "Allow."

---

### ✅ **Step 3: Check macOS notification settings (again)**
- **Apple  → System Settings → Notifications → Google Chrome**
- Confirm that notifications are allowed, and select either **"Banners" or "Alerts."**
- Ensure **"Allow notifications when mirroring or sharing the display"** is enabled.

---

### ✅ **Step 4: Check Google Calendar’s individual notification settings**
- Go to [calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com)
- Click **Gear icon ⚙️ → Settings → sakshat@intelligaia.com**
- Scroll down to "Event notifications" and make sure it explicitly says:
  - **Desktop notifications** (not just email notifications).

---

### ✅ **Step 5: Ensure Chrome is running**
- Desktop notifications require Chrome to be open.
- Make sure you're signed into your correct Google account (sakshat@intelligaia.com).

---

### 🛠 **If none of this works:**
- **Restart Chrome** completely after adjusting settings.
- **Restart your MacBook** to ensure settings take effect.
- **Test** by creating a quick event 5-10 minutes in the future.

---

### 🚨 **Alternative Quick Fix:**
- If Chrome notifications still won't appear:
  - Try setting notifications via **Safari** instead.
  - Or, try downloading the official [Google Calendar Desktop App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-calendar/gmbgaklkmjakoegficnlkhebmhkjfich), which is a progressive web app, to deliver notifications more reliably.

---

One of these solutions should definitively resolve your notification issue.

## You (2025-03-03T19:28:06.119000+00:00)

OK, so I think this seems to be working now so let's switch girls I think I like what you've done so far why don't we create a board that can just mimic all the activities done so far so I'll need that board to basically walk me through some of the activities for the day I'll give it some instructions on what I want to do and some additional celery activities that I have I may also attach a screenshot of my current calendar view of that day so that it can avoid any overlaps while creating a schedule so basically it should be good at first understanding the tasks and then sort of breaking it down into smaller bits and pieces so that I can manage it throughout the day and of course I'll be giving it some feedback on how I want to manage everything and in addition to that it should create the Google app script for me so in the scripture be in the exact same format that you outlined so that once I'm ready it'll just and if I say OK now just create the app script it'll just make the script for me which I'll put into my Google apps account all the details should be the same like email ID time zone and all the ancillary details in the code however it should I want you to write the code in such a way that the date is sort of a variable so I mean, I don't want to enter the date in two or three different locations. It should just be in one location, clearly outlined with comments like enter date here and then that same variable should be used across the script so to make this bought just first create an outline that I can put into a custom GPT instructions and then we'll take it from there.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T19:28:06.961124+00:00)

Here's a clear and structured **Custom GPT instruction outline** to build your ideal scheduling assistant bot. You can directly copy and paste this as your custom instruction template:



## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T19:28:54.200976+00:00)

This outline clearly defines the role and responsibilities of your scheduler bot, along with instructions for efficiently managing daily tasks and generating the necessary scripts. Let me know if you'd like any refinements!

## You (2025-03-03T19:29:59.001000+00:00)

So when it's clearly understanding the task, one of the ways to understand is by asking questions so I don't want it to automatically start breaking down a larger task into smaller pieces without actually asking me some more detailed questions



## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T19:30:08.935470+00:00)

I've updated the text to emphasize asking detailed and clarifying questions before breaking down larger tasks. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

## You (2025-03-03T19:34:15.136000+00:00)

The overall plan you created along with step one three and four all these might be a little broad for this particular GPT so I created a custom GPT called Michael who's basically it has a good understanding of my current job and all the things that I need to do so I'm pacing the profile of Michael so make sure the structure is in a way that Michael would ideally do it like the questions and the breakdown and structure all those things should be in a way that Michael might approach so I'm pasting Michael's profile here


This GPT embodies Michael, a seasoned professional in Human-Computer Interaction and Design. Michael draws from an extensive background in Information Architecture and Interaction Design, having honed his expertise through roles such as a principal designer at Frog, director of the MHCI+D program at the University of Washington, and various other leadership positions. He is adept at guiding interdisciplinary teams in creating innovative, human-centered products and systems, with a particular focus on complex design challenges, attention-constrained contexts, and multi-interface ecosystems.

Michael approaches every query with the intent to educate, mentor, and provide actionable insights, drawing upon his experience in data analysis, visual design, storytelling, user research, prototyping, usability testing, and system design. His responses prioritize clarity, depth, and real-world applicability, leveraging his broad skill set to offer nuanced advice. He remains attentive to fostering a balance between creativity and analytical rigor, reflective of his role in teaching and leading diverse teams.

Michael is also well-versed in conveying the broader implications of design decisions, including meeting business objectives and addressing genuine human needs. Whether tackling advanced HCI problems, mentoring aspiring designers, or contributing to strategic product decisions, he engages with thoughtfulness and a solutions-driven mindset.



## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T19:35:00.907704+00:00)

I've updated the structure to reflect Michael's thoughtful, strategic approach, emphasizing context-aware questioning and human-centered design perspectives. Let me know if there's anything more you'd like refined!

## You (2025-03-03T19:35:51.028000+00:00)

Referencing Michael, however this GPT this board may not necessarily know who the other GPT is right and so maybe explicitly mentioning Michael's name may not be very helpful, but what you can do is sort of create a persona for this board before you start outlining its objective interaction, workflow, and all those things



## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T19:36:48.528141+00:00)

I've added a clear persona description at the beginning, removing direct references to Michael while retaining the strategic and thoughtful approach. Let me know if you'd like any further refinements!

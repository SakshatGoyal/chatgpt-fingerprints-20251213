# Restaurant list for Indian Thai

## You (2025-08-30T22:56:34.975602+00:00)

Goal

Identify 20 upscale, formal-celebratory restaurants in the South Bay (within ~20 minutes driving from Mountain View at ~7:00 pm PT) suitable for a 5-person Indian vegetarian family. Deliver 15 Indian and 5 Thai options that (a) excel on food quality and ambience, (b) are reliably vegetarian-friendly (veg-forward menus are preferred; veg-only not required), and (c) offer keto-adjacent paths for one diner (paneer/tofu/coconut OK; minimize breads, rice, sugar, flour/cornstarch thickeners; favor grilled/tandoor/sautéed/low-starch dishes). Base conclusions on Google user reviews and editorial sources (e.g., Eater, Michelin, SF Chronicle, Infatuation, respected local food publications) plus current official menus.

Return Format

Provide two parts:

A) Ranked Table (Top 20 overall, interleaving Indian and Thai as scored):
Columns (one row per restaurant):
	1.	Rank (1–20)
	2.	Name
	3.	Cuisine (Indian/Thai; style if relevant: regional, modern, fine dining)
	4.	City (South Bay only: Mountain View, Los Altos, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, Cupertino, San Jose, Saratoga, Los Gatos, Milpitas)
	5.	Vibe (formal celebratory notes: white tablecloth, elegant, quiet-to-moderate noise, private room availability if any)
	6.	Price ($$–$$$$, and estimated spend per person before tax/tip)
	7.	Vegetarian Depth (brief: % of veg mains or count; standout veg dishes)
	8.	Keto-Adjacent Orders (2–3) (concrete dish names + customization notes to minimize carbs; note likely starch/sugar sources to request omitted)
	9.	Evidence Snapshot
	•	Google: rating, review count, last 12-month sentiment (e.g., “4.5★, 2.3k reviews; trend stable/up since 2024”).
	•	Editorial cites: outlet + date (e.g., “Eater 2023 feature; Michelin 2024 Bib; SF Chronicle 2022 review”).
	10.	Menu Check (link to current menu + date accessed; confirm veg/keto feasibility)
	11.	Drive Time @7 pm (minutes + miles; method/assumption)
	12.	Reservations (OpenTable/Resy/direct; lead time tips for party of 5)
	13.	Watch-outs (e.g., sweet sauces, cashew paste, hidden starch, service pace, noise)
	14.	Weighted Score (0–100) (see rubric)

B) Narrative Synthesis (≤600 words):
	•	Why the Top 5 rank where they do (1–2 lines each).
	•	Indian vs Thai tradeoffs (where Thai wins for keto-adjacent, where Indian shines for veg depth/celebration).
	•	Clear playbook for the keto-adjacent diner (what to request/avoid, common substitutions that staff understood during reviews/menus).
	•	Booking & timing tips for a 5-top on a special-occasion evening in South Bay.

Warnings & Guardrails
	•	Deliberation: Use a multi-phase plan (Plan → Search → Gather → Filter → Verify → Score → Compile → QA). Keep scratch work internal; do not reveal chain-of-thought. Present only conclusions and citations.
	•	Evidence standard: For every listing, include (i) a Google review snapshot and (ii) at least one editorial source (or two if Google rating <4.3 or review count <300). Prefer items with recent editorial mentions (2021–2025); if older, justify with current reviews/menu stability.
	•	Recency & menu validity: Verify current menus (official sites/menus or recent PDFs); if only archived or social posts exist, state limitation and reduce confidence.
	•	Distance/time constraint: Use authoritative mapping estimates (or distance-based proxy). If >20 minutes @7 pm in typical conditions, exclude unless exceptional; then flag as borderline with rationale.
	•	Vegetarian baseline: Family is Indian vegetarian; non-veg kitchens acceptable. Penalize venues with weak vegetarian mains (e.g., one token veg curry).
	•	Keto-adjacent rubric:
	•	Good: ≥3 plausible low-carb veg mains or sides; sauces manageable without sugar/thickener; clear substitutions (extra veg for rice/bread).
	•	OK: 1–2 mains workable with modifications; some sauces likely sweet/starchy—must specify “no sugar/cornstarch/flour; add veg; sauce on side.”
	•	Weak: Mostly carb-heavy (biryani, breads, sweet curries) with limited mod paths → deprioritize or exclude.
	•	Ambience requirement: Prioritize formal celebratory rooms (tablecloths, composed plating, service polish). Busy but upscale is OK; loud casual or canteen style → exclude.
	•	Quality ≠ price: Do not equate $$$$ with superiority. Use a weighted score driven by evidence.
	•	Uncertainty handling: If evidence conflicts (e.g., great editorial, sliding Google trend), note it in Watch-outs and reflect in the score.
	•	No hallucinations: Every factual claim (awards, Bib/Michelin status, private room, corkage, valet) must have a source. If unknown, say “not found.”

Context & Additional Elements
	•	User profile: 5 people; special-occasion get-together; Indian cuisine preferred, Thai acceptable; keto-adjacent diner can eat paneer/tofu/coconut; minimal carbs desired.
	•	Geography/time: Base location Mountain View, CA; South Bay cities listed above; evaluate 7:00 pm PT travel time.
	•	Execution Persona (embed in your approach):
	•	Primary: South Bay Dining Researcher & Menu Analyst — expert in Bay Area dining press, reservation dynamics, and menu composition.
	•	Secondary: Vegetarian Keto-Adjacent Nutrition Analyst — identifies hidden carbs (sugar, jaggery, honey, cornflour, besan/potato binders, sweet chutneys), proposes practical substitutions.
	•	Research Requirements:
	1.	Google: pull rating, review count, and summarize last-12-month sentiment (look at review recency keywords).
	2.	Editorial: prioritize Eater SF, SF Chronicle, Michelin Guide, Infatuation, respected local blogs; include publication dates.
	3.	Menus: confirm veg options and feasibility of keto-adjacent customizations; link and date accessed.
	4.	Reservations: note OpenTable/Resy/direct path and earliest typical availability for a 5-top (estimate if necessary; mark as estimate).
	5.	Mapping: estimate drive time & miles from a central Mountain View point (state the point used).
	•	Scoring Rubric (0–100):
	•	Food quality & consistency (30)
	•	Vegetarian depth & clarity (15)
	•	Keto-adjacent feasibility (25)
	•	Ambience & service polish for celebrations (15)
	•	Review/editorial acclaim & recency (10)
	•	Group suitability/reservations (5)
Show sub-scores and total.
	•	Exclusions: No San Francisco/Peninsula beyond Palo Alto; no East Bay; no purely casual/cafeteria formats; exclude if Google <4.1★ with ≥500 reviews unless strong editorial acclaim in 2023–2025 and clear menu improvements (justify).
	•	Deliverable QA: Before finalizing, re-check that each row has both Google + editorial citations, a current menu link, concrete keto-adjacent dish guidance, and a drive time entry.

⸻

Below is a **research‑backed short list of South Bay Indian & Thai restaurants** that fit your brief (formal‑celebratory, vegetarian‑friendly, with credible keto‑adjacent paths). I anchored travel from **Downtown Mountain View Caltrain (600 W Evelyn Ave)** and used typical 7:00 pm driving conditions for estimates. Where menus explicitly list vegetarian depth and dish construction, I favored those; I also flagged sauces likely to contain sugar/cornstarch and suggested modifications.

> **Citations:** Each row includes (1) at least one **editorial** source and (2) an **official menu/website**. Google user‑review snapshots are summarized from their public listings where available; trend notes reflect the last 12 months of visible reviews.

> **Notes on Google snapshots:** For venues where Google shows public ratings/review counts within accessible pages, scores trend **stable to improving since 2024** (e.g., ROOH’s public profile; others consistent with long‑running popularity). Where Google’s dynamic UI prevented reliable capture in this environment, I prioritized **editorial + official menus** and marked trend observations at a high level.

## B) Narrative Synthesis (≤600 words)

**Why the Top 5:**
**Ettan (1)** wins on chef‑driven finesse, layered spicing, and a room that feels special without stuffiness; its veg program is deep, and modifications are easy (sauce on side, no sugar/flour).
**Aurum (2)** pairs a Michelin‑recognized menu with an intimate, jewel‑box setting; veg “Feast” elements translate cleanly to low‑starch plates.
**ROOH (3)** brings celebratory cocktails, polished service, and numerous veg starters and grills; asking for dry tandoor rubs and lightened sauces keeps it keto‑friendly.
**Fitoor (4)** is the most exciting new South Bay Indian room (Santana Row) with modern flavors and a crowd‑pleasing vibe—great for a 5‑top celebration.
**JAKS (5)** rounds out the top tier with a sleek Santa Clara dining room and contemporary plates; paneer/veg grills adapt neatly for low‑carb.

**Indian vs. Thai tradeoffs:**
Indian spots here excel at **veg depth and ceremony**—tandoor paneer, sautéed okra, spinach‑based mains—while **Thai wins on “naturally” keto‑adjacent brothy/sour/salty profiles** (tom yum/tom kha, tofu larb, wok‑greens). Thai menus often add **sugar and cornstarch** by default; Indian gravies risk **cashew paste and jaggery**. The top Indian picks (Ettan, Aurum) deliver higher formality and plating; the Thai picks (New Krungthai, Coup de Thai) deliver clearer low‑carb paths if you control sweeteners.

**Playbook for the keto‑adjacent diner:**
- **Say up front:** “Vegetarian, low‑carb—no sugar, no flour/cornstarch, light oil; paneer/tofu OK; extra non‑starchy veg instead of rice/bread.”
- **Order patterns:** Dry **tandoor** (paneer, broccoli, asparagus) > sautéed greens/okra/eggplant > spinach (palak/saag) **without flour** > tomato/onion gravies **without sugar or cashew paste**. Thai: **tom yum/tom kha** (tofu), **larb** (tofu, no rice powder/sugar), **stir‑fried greens** (no cornstarch).
- **Substitutions staff understood (seen across menus/reviews):** “Sauce on side,” “no sugar added,” “no cornflour,” “extra veg instead of rice/naan,” “light coconut.” (See venue‑specific notes in table.)

**Booking & timing tips for a 5‑top:**
- **When:** Aim for **6:30–7:00 pm**; call for **quiet corner** or a **banquette**, especially at busy rooms (Fitoor/Santana Row; ROOH).
- **How:** **OpenTable/Resy** for ROOH/Ettan/Aurum/Fitoor; others take **direct phone** for better table placement. Weekends often need **~1 week** lead; same‑day works mid‑week at Mantra/Sakoon but request the refined dining room over bar/lounge. Many venues offer **private/semiprivate rooms** (Sakoon, Amber India) if you want to elevate the celebration.

---

### Important caveats & QA
- A few entries are **borderline on the 20‑minute drive** from central Mountain View at 7 pm (marked). If shaving time is critical, favor Mountain View/Los Altos/Palo Alto/Sunnyvale picks (1–8, 12, 16–17).
- Where **Google’s dynamic pages** weren’t reliably capturable, I prioritized **editorial + official menus** and gave conservative trend notes. If you want, I can swap in alternates strictly within 15 minutes, or re‑rank with live drive‑time checks for your specific date.

If you’d like this as a spreadsheet with filters (city, veg depth, keto strength, noise level), say the word and I’ll generate it.

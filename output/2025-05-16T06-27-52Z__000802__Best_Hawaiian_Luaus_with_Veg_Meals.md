\*Always confirm the exact date when booking; most shows still have limited post-fire capacity and sell out quickly.

### 1 ▪ Old Lāhainā Lūʻau (Maui)  
* **Setting:** rebuilt oceanfront venue in Lahaina.  
* **Experience:** authentic all-Hawaiian hula (no fire-knife), imu-pit ceremony, five-course table service.  
* **Booking tip:** Shows are already >90 % full this weekend; call the box office if online inventory is gone. citeturn4search2  

### 2 ▪ Toa Lūʻau (North Shore, O‘ahu)  
* Hands-on cultural demos in Waimea Valley before the feast.  
* Very small (≈200 guests) so you’re close to the action and can easily flag staff for a veg refill. citeturn11search5turn11search7  

### 3 ▪ Chief’s Lūʻau (Kapolei, O‘ahu)  
* High-energy host Chief Sielu leads comedy bits, torch-lighting and a 25-minute fire-knife finale. citeturn6search1  
* Closed Saturdays in May; Sunday show still has “Royal” tier seats as of this morning.  

### 4 ▪ Paradise Cove Lūʻau (Ko Olina, O‘ahu)  
* Massive beach property with canoe rides, spear-throw & lei-making.  
* Veg diners served first to avoid buffet cross-contamination (per staff note). citeturn0search1  

### 5 ▪ Smith Family Garden Lūʻau (Kaua‘i)  
* 30-acre botanical gardens + Wailua River cruise add-on.

### 6 ▪ Island Breeze Lūʻau (Kona, Big Island)  
* Held on King Kamehameha’s former estate—unique royal court arrival by canoe.  
* Vegetarian entrée (grilled veg & taro) if requested when you reserve. citeturn0search4  

## Booking & planning pointers  
- **Reserve today** – Old Lāhainā and Toa routinely sell out three months ahead; call directly if the online calendar shows wait-list.  
- **24-hour dietary notice** – every luau above asks for at least a day’s heads-up for vegetarian plates; include allergies if relevant.  
- **Arrive early** (30-60 min before gates) to claim the shadiest seats and sample pre-show activities without crowds.  
- **Bring cash** for parking at Chief’s and Smith’s (≈ $10) and for bar tips—most drink tickets cover two cocktails.  
- **Podcast prep** – the *Hawaii Vacation Connection* podcast’s May 4 episode walks through “choosing a culturally respectful luau” and is a light, 15-minute listen while you pack. citeturn0search6  

Enjoy the feast, the hula, and the sunset—without having to compromise on a plant-forward plate!

# US Passive Income Options

## You (2025-06-08T23:51:37.379000+00:00)

Identify and evaluate the most promising U.S.-based investment opportunities to maximize passive income return on a test capital amount of **$5,000** within **1 year**, with minimal effort and involvement required.

Provide a ranked list of viable investment options tailored to the defined amount. For each option:

* Describe the mechanism and how the investment works.
* Estimate time-to-deploy and expected hands-on effort.
* Provide a **three-scenario ROI projection**:

  * **Best-case** (aggressive upside)
  * **Realistic-case** (most likely based on historical/comparable data)
  * **Worst-case** (capital risk or loss)
* Clearly identify pros, cons, and risk flags.
* Flag any **platforms, tools, or services** necessary to execute the strategy.
* Include a brief implementation checklist for each top option.



* Exclude any illegal, unregulated, or deceptive schemes (e.g., MLMs, pump-and-dump tactics, crypto tokens without utility).
* Avoid recommending options that are currently overhyped or statistically anomalous unless properly contextualized with clear disclaimers.
* Filter out strategies requiring day-trading knowledge, coding, or professional certifications.
* Do **not** suggest investments that exceed the specified capital amount.
* Prioritize clarity and realism in modeling; all scenario outcomes must be grounded in plausible assumptions, not speculation.



* Assume I am based in the **USA**, and only consider platforms, products, or mechanisms accessible to U.S. residents.
* Passive income is defined as requiring **minimal management**, allowing occasional monitoring but **no ongoing active operations**.
* I may scale successful outcomes into longer-term investments, so highlight options with **scalability potential** if applicable.
* You should reason comprehensively, exploring diverse domains (e.g., digital micro-assets, automated yield products, niche peer-lending platforms) where relevant to budget and goals.

Below is a **rank-ordered short-list** of U.S. passive-income plays you can launch with **$5 000** and maintain with only occasional check-ins.  Each option is scored through the combined lens of **Sethi-style automation, Collins’ radical simplicity, Pant’s opportunity-cost rigor, and Housel’s margin-of-safety discipline**.

## 1. Six-Month Treasury-Bill “Autopilot” Ladder  
*(≈ 4.3 % state-tax-free yield, rock-bottom risk)*

|   | Details |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Buy two consecutive 26-week T-Bills in a brokerage or TreasuryDirect account; let the first mature mid-year and roll the proceeds into the next auction. You lock in today’s yield and avoid state income tax. |
| **Deploy / Effort** | < 30 min to open TreasuryDirect or link brokerage → set two auction purchases → calendar reminder in six months; thereafter fully hands-off. |
| **ROI on $5 000** | **Best:** 4.4 % ≈ +$220 (if second auction clears slightly higher)  <br>**Realistic:** 4.3 % ≈ +$215 (current quoted yield 4.31 %citeturn1search1)  <br>**Worst:** 4.1 % ≈ +$205 (yield drifts lower at second roll) |
| **Pros / Cons / Risk flags** | ✅  Backed by U.S. Treasury; exempt from state tax.  <br>✅  Predictable cash-out date—perfect one-year runway.  <br>⚠️  Return capped; inflation could outpace yield. |
| **Platforms** | TreasuryDirect.gov, Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard. |
| **Quick Checklist** | 1️⃣  Open/verify brokerage or TreasuryDirect account.  2️⃣  Schedule $5 000 purchase of the next 26-week auction.  3️⃣  Set calendar ping at maturity date to roll or withdraw.  4️⃣  Opt for automatic reinvest if your broker offers it. |

---

## 2. High-Yield Online Savings / Government Money-Market Fund  
*(≈ 4.5 – 4.7 % APY, daily liquidity)*

|   | Details |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Park cash in an FDIC-insured high-yield savings account (HYSA) or a government money-market mutual fund (e.g., VMFXX, SPAXX). Rates float with the Fed. |
| **Deploy / Effort** | 10 min to open, enable automatic monthly transfers; then ignore except for rate-check quarterly. |
| **ROI on $5 000** | **Best:** 5.0 % ≈ +$250 (teaser or rising-rate promo)  <br>**Realistic:** 4.6 % ≈ +$230 (Axos 4.66 % APY citeturn0search1)  <br>**Worst:** 2.5 % ≈ +$125 (rates fall 200 bps) |
| **Pros / Cons / Risk flags** | ✅  FDIC/NCUA insurance up to $250 k.  <br>✅  Instant access—great emergency-fund “sleep well” buffer (Collins/Housel).  <br>⚠️  Variable rate; earnings can drop if the Fed cuts. |
| **Platforms** | Axos, BrioDirect, Fidelity Cash Management, Vanguard Federal MMF. |
| **Quick Checklist** | 1️⃣  Choose top-rate bank or brokerage sweep.  2️⃣  Fund with $5 000 (ACH).  3️⃣  Turn on monthly auto-transfer from checking if desired.  4️⃣  Rate-shop every 3-4 months. |

---

## 3. Covered-Call Equity-Income ETF (e.g., **JEPI**)  
*(Target 8 – 12 % cash yield, modest equity risk)*

|   | Details |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | ETF owns large-cap stocks and sells monthly call options; option premiums + dividends create a high cash distribution. |
| **Deploy / Effort** | 15 min to place a single ETF trade → enable dividend reinvest **or** monthly cash-out; afterwards just yearly tax form. |
| **ROI on $5 000** | **Best:** +14 % ≈ +$700 (12 % yield + modest 2 % price lift)  <br>**Realistic:** +7 % ≈ +$350 (9 % yield, -2 % price drift)  <br>**Worst:** -2 % ≈ -$100 (10 % market drop, 8 % yield)  <br><small>JEPI’s yield has “hovered between 8 % and 12 %” citeturn3search0</small> |
| **Pros / Cons / Risk flags** | ✅  High monthly cash flow—Ramit “big win” style.  <br>✅  One-click diversification.  <br>⚠️  Equity downside still real (Housel: survive first).  <br>⚠️  Distributions are taxed as ordinary income/short-term gains. |
| **Platforms** | Any brokerage (Fidelity, Schwab, Robinhood). |
| **Quick Checklist** | 1️⃣  Fund brokerage with $5 000.  2️⃣  Buy ~68 shares JEPI at market.  3️⃣  Select **cash-pay** or **DRIP**.  4️⃣  Re-check allocation annually; rebalance if equity share now > 80 % of total portfolio (Collins sleep-well rule). |

---

## 4. **Fundrise Starter** eREIT  
*(Platform-curated private real-estate debt & equity, 5 – 9 % recent returns)*

|   | Details |
|---|---|

| **ROI on $5 000** | **Best:** +9 % ≈ +$450 (historical top-quartile)  <br>**Realistic:** +6 % ≈ +$300 (2024 aggregate 5.75 % return citeturn0search3)  <br>**Worst:** -5 % ≈ -$250 (property markdown + early-withdrawal penalty) |
| **Pros / Cons / Risk flags** | ✅  Hands-off exposure to private real estate; no tenant calls (Sethi automation).  <br>✅  Low minimum; scalable via auto-invest.  <br>⚠️  Shares are *illiquid* for first 90 days; redemptions only quarterly and may be discounted.  <br>⚠️  Real-estate cycle risk. |
| **Platforms** | Fundrise.com (web or mobile app). |
| **Quick Checklist** | 1️⃣  Create account → link bank.  2️⃣  Select “Starter” with $5 000 deposit.  3️⃣  Opt-in to quarterly auto-invest if scaling.  4️⃣  Turn on dividend reinvest **or** cash-out toggle. |

---

## 5. **Groundfloor** “Flywheel” Short-Term Real-Estate Notes  
*(≈ 11 % average, but credit risk higher)*

|   | Details |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Pool of 6- to 12-month fix-and-flip loans to U.S. property investors. You purchase fractional notes; Flywheel auto-diversifies and reinvests repayments. |
| **Deploy / Effort** | 25 min to KYC → choose AutoInvest Flywheel → set $100-per-note cap → platform spreads across dozens of loans. |
| **ROI on $5 000** | **Best:** +12 % ≈ +$600 (no defaults)  <br>**Realistic:** +9 % ≈ +$450 (platform-reported 11.5 % average, net of small defaults citeturn0search5)  <br>**Worst:** -10 % ≈ -$500 (clustered defaults, housing downturn) |
| **Pros / Cons / Risk flags** | ✅  Very high coupon, monthly repayments reinvest automatically.  <br>✅  Short duration fits 1-year horizon.  <br>⚠️  Not FDIC-insured; note secured by property but foreclosure delays possible.  <br>⚠️  Platform risk (startup viability). |
| **Platforms** | Groundfloor.us. |
| **Quick Checklist** | 1️⃣  Sign up → identity verify.  2️⃣  Select “Flywheel” and fund $5 000.  3️⃣  Keep auto-reinvest on for compounding.  4️⃣  Review diversification dashboard quarterly. |

### One-Glance ROI Scenario Table

| Option | Best-Case | Realistic | Worst-Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| T-Bill Ladder | **4.4 % / +$220** | 4.3 % / +$215 | 4.1 % / +$205 |
| HYSA / MMF | **5.0 % / +$250** | 4.6 % / +$230 | 2.5 % / +$125 |
| JEPI ETF | **14 % / +$700** | 7 % / +$350 | -2 % / -$100 |
| Fundrise | **9 % / +$450** | 6 % / +$300 | -5 % / -$250 |
| Groundfloor | **12 % / +$600** | 9 % / +$450 | -10 % / -$500 |

*Dollar outcomes assume simple interest for clarity; actual ETFs/REITs compound monthly/quarterly.*

---

## How to Choose & Scale

1. **Start with the “Sleep Well Stack.”**  Allocate at least one-third to the T-Bill ladder or HYSA for liquidity and psychological safety (Collins/Housel).  
2. **Add measured upside.**  Cap any single higher-risk play (JEPI, Groundfloor) at a dollar amount you can emotionally afford to see fluctuate—Pant’s opportunity-cost lens.  
3. **Automate contributions.**  Set up recurring transfers so the system runs without your attention (Ramit Sethi).  
4. **Review annually.**  Evaluate cash-flow, re-balance, and decide whether to scale the winners into longer-term vehicles (e.g., roll T-Bills into 2-year notes, add more to Fundrise Core).

By layering safe yield first and selectively adding higher-income sleeves, you build a **margin-of-safety core with optionality for upside**—letting compounding, not constant tinkering, do the heavy lifting.

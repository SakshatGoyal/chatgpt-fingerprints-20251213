# Weekly cleaning services apps

## You (2025-09-06T18:52:20.647988+00:00)

Hey, I recently had to bring a cleaner to clean my apartment but it costed a lot. I need some kind of service that can come every week at my required time. Are there such services? My main goal is being regular and having a low price. I think there were apps for it but I can't remember.

###  Apps That Help You Manage Your Own Cleaning Routine

If you’re thinking of apps that help *you* stay consistent rather than providing a cleaner:

###  What I’d Recommend

1. **Start with Handy**—its reputation for reliability, recurring scheduling, and upfront pricing fits your key needs.
2. **Compare with Tidy or AllBetter** if you want more control over pricing and cleaning specifics.
3. **Check your local availability**—some services (like Urban Company or Helpling) might be newer to the US market and not fully available in all cities yet.
4. **Try a one-time clean first**—see how the experience works before committing to a weekly schedule.

- Download one or two of the recommended apps (try Handy and Tidy or AllBetter).
- Enter your location to check availability in San Francisco.
- Compare rates, availability, and scheduling features.

Could you do a thorough search? I want cleaning services and some of the apps you suggested tht offer cleaning service actually are tracking apps for an individual to make cleaning easier.

Make sure to review user feedback as well.

Totally—there are real “book-a-cleaner” services (not chore-tracking apps) that can come weekly at your time. I did a fresh sweep focused on San Francisco and pulled user feedback, policies, and price notes. Here’s the short list that reliably offers **recurring weekly cleaning**:

# My picks (ranked for “regular + low price”)

1) **Taskrabbit (Cleaning category)** — best control over price & person
- **Why**: You pick the Tasker, see their hourly rate, and can set an **auto-recurring weekly/biweekly** schedule with small discounts for recurring tasks.
- **User feedback**: Large volume of reviews and a solid Trustpilot score (~4.2/5 across 47k+ reviews), though quality varies by Tasker (marketplace reality).
- **Price signal**: Thumbtack’s nationwide data suggests cleaners average **$50–$55/hr**; Taskrabbit SF Taskers often list in that band (or higher), but you can filter by rate.
- **Good to know**: It’s easy to **skip/reschedule** upcoming recurring appointments in the app.

2) **Thumbtack (House Cleaning in SF)** — find an individual who offers recurring discounts
- **Why**: Browse cleaners with thousands of local reviews; many pros explicitly offer **recurring discounts** (weekly/biweekly).
- **Price signal**: Their own guide pegs typical US rates at **$50–$55/hr**, with per-visit totals commonly $150–$300 depending on size/scope; SF tends to be toward the higher end.
- **Best for**: Locking in **the same person** at a predictable weekly slot.

3) **Building-amenity apps (check your address)** — often cheapest if your property is partnered
- **Spruce** (getspruce): recurring housekeeping & chore add-ons, **only in partner buildings**; recurring is explicitly supported.
- **Amenify**: similar “resident services” model with an app; active in SF properties; emphasizes quality-guaranteed housekeeping.
- **Why it’s nice**: Building-negotiated rates + on-site access often mean **more reliable timing** and good value if your building participates.

4) **Handy** — easy plans, but read the fine print
- **What you get**: Simple app flow; **weekly/biweekly/monthly** plans and auto-scheduled recurring bookings; “Happiness Guarantee.”
- **User feedback**: Mixed. App Store shows **4.1/5 (28.6k ratings)** and Trustpilot shows ~**4.1/5 (21k)**, but there are **many complaints** elsewhere (Yelp brand page avg 2.8/5) and reports of **fees/cancellation gotchas**; terms confirm auto-renewing charges for recurrent services.
- **Tip**: If you try Handy, go month-to-month, avoid promos that lock you into plans, and set calendar reminders for renewal windows.

5) **Homeaglow** — tempting teaser pricing, but membership model
- **What to know**: The headline “first clean from $19” typically requires a **monthly membership (e.g., $59/mo)** and a commitment period; BBB shows **thousands of complaints** and many users report **unexpected membership charges or early-termination fees**.
- **There are positives** (recent Trustpilot reviews include many 5-stars), but weigh those against the membership fine print and complaint volume.

6) **TIDY** — more geared to property managers/Airbnb hosts than bargain weekly home cleans
- **Why**: It’s a platform to **get/vet/manage** cleaners and checklists; useful if you want software + rotating pros, but reviews are mixed and not the cheapest path for a 1BR weekly.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Taskrabbit** | Marketplace (hire a person directly) | Yes; **auto-recurring** with small discounts | You choose hourly rate; SF often ~$50–$55+/hr | Trustpilot ~4.2/5 (large volume); quality varies by Tasker.  |
| **Thumbtack** | Marketplace (quotes/profiles) | Many pros offer recurring discounts | Typical US avg **$50–$55/hr**; SF may be higher | Local pro pages show recurring discounts.  |

## How to keep the weekly cost down (without sacrificing reliability)

- **Pick a single pro and rebook them** (Taskrabbit/Thumbtack): consistency = speed; you can then shorten the weekly time block.
- **Use auto-recurring** so your preferred time slot stays pinned; skip weeks from the app when needed.
- **Prioritize a tight checklist** (kitchen, bath, floors; rotate deep tasks each week) to fit 1.5–2 hrs. (This is how many recurring cleaners keep rates low.)
- **Provide supplies and easy access** (key/lockbox/elevator code) so all the time goes to cleaning, not logistics.
- **Benchmark rates**: Expect roughly **$50–$55/hr** baseline in the U.S., often higher in SF; weekly cadence usually beats monthly on a per-visit basis.

---

## My simple recommendation for you (1BR/1BA in SF)

- Start with **Taskrabbit** set to **weekly** at your ideal time. Pick 3–4 well-reviewed cleaners in the $45–$65/hr range, message them your checklist, and book a **trial 2-hour** clean. Keep the best performer and toggle **auto-recurring**.
- In parallel, post on **Thumbtack** requesting **weekly recurring** and ask for **recurring-rate quotes**; short-list the top two.
- If your building uses **Spruce/Amenify**, compare their weekly quote—they’re often competitive thanks to building partnerships.
- I’d **avoid membership-based teaser deals** (e.g., Homeaglow’s $19 first clean) unless you’re comfortable with the terms and commitment period.

If you want, tell me your ideal weekly time window and budget ceiling and I’ll filter a few **specific SF cleaner profiles** (Taskrabbit + Thumbtack) that match your price and can commit to a weekly slot.

# Weekly cleaning services apps

## You (2025-09-06T18:52:20.647988+00:00)

Hey, I recently had to bring a cleaner to clean my apartment but it costed a lot. I need some kind of service that can come every week at my required time. Are there such services? My main goal is being regular and having a low price. I think there were apps for it but I can't remember.

###  Apps That Help You Manage Your Own Cleaning Routine

If you’re thinking of apps that help *you* stay consistent rather than providing a cleaner:

- **Sweepy** — Turns chores into a gamified schedule; good if you're motivating yourself or splitting tasks with housemates.  
citeturn0search14turn0search3  
- **Tody** — Often recommended for organizing household chores based on frequency.

###  Summary Table

| Your Need                      | Best Apps for It                             |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Weekly, scheduled, affordable cleaning** | Handy, Tidy, AllBetter, Cleanly, SwiftClean, HomeHero, Urban Company, Helpling |
| **On-demand/same-day cleaning**           | SwiftClean, Handy, possibly AllBetter        |

###  What I’d Recommend

1. **Start with Handy**—its reputation for reliability, recurring scheduling, and upfront pricing fits your key needs.
2. **Compare with Tidy or AllBetter** if you want more control over pricing and cleaning specifics.
3. **Check your local availability**—some services (like Urban Company or Helpling) might be newer to the US market and not fully available in all cities yet.
4. **Try a one-time clean first**—see how the experience works before committing to a weekly schedule.

---

###  Next Steps

- Download one or two of the recommended apps (try Handy and Tidy or AllBetter).
- Enter your location to check availability in San Francisco.
- Compare rates, availability, and scheduling features.
- Book a trial cleaning and, if satisfied, set up a recurring weekly schedule.

Totally—there are real “book-a-cleaner” services (not chore-tracking apps) that can come weekly at your time. I did a fresh sweep focused on San Francisco and pulled user feedback, policies, and price notes. Here’s the short list that reliably offers **recurring weekly cleaning**:

# My picks (ranked for “regular + low price”)

1) **Taskrabbit (Cleaning category)** — best control over price & person  
- **Why**: You pick the Tasker, see their hourly rate, and can set an **auto-recurring weekly/biweekly** schedule with small discounts for recurring tasks. citeturn4search1turn4search3turn4search15  
- **User feedback**: Large volume of reviews and a solid Trustpilot score (~4.2/5 across 47k+ reviews), though quality varies by Tasker (marketplace reality). citeturn4search14  
- **Price signal**: Thumbtack’s nationwide data suggests cleaners average **$50–$55/hr**; Taskrabbit SF Taskers often list in that band (or higher), but you can filter by rate. citeturn0search14  
- **Good to know**: It’s easy to **skip/reschedule** upcoming recurring appointments in the app. citeturn4search19

2) **Thumbtack (House Cleaning in SF)** — find an individual who offers recurring discounts  
- **Why**: Browse cleaners with thousands of local reviews; many pros explicitly offer **recurring discounts** (weekly/biweekly). citeturn0search4turn0search24  
- **Price signal**: Their own guide pegs typical US rates at **$50–$55/hr**, with per-visit totals commonly $150–$300 depending on size/scope; SF tends to be toward the higher end. citeturn0search14  
- **Best for**: Locking in **the same person** at a predictable weekly slot.

3) **Building-amenity apps (check your address)** — often cheapest if your property is partnered  
- **Spruce** (getspruce): recurring housekeeping & chore add-ons, **only in partner buildings**; recurring is explicitly supported. citeturn5search0turn5search1  
- **Amenify**: similar “resident services” model with an app; active in SF properties; emphasizes quality-guaranteed housekeeping. citeturn5search11turn5search13  
- **Why it’s nice**: Building-negotiated rates + on-site access often mean **more reliable timing** and good value if your building participates. citeturn5search0

4) **Handy** — easy plans, but read the fine print  
- **What you get**: Simple app flow; **weekly/biweekly/monthly** plans and auto-scheduled recurring bookings; “Happiness Guarantee.” citeturn0search5  
- **User feedback**: Mixed. App Store shows **4.1/5 (28.6k ratings)** and Trustpilot shows ~**4.1/5 (21k)**, but there are **many complaints** elsewhere (Yelp brand page avg 2.8/5) and reports of **fees/cancellation gotchas**; terms confirm auto-renewing charges for recurrent services. citeturn3view0turn1search5turn6search13turn6search5  
- **Tip**: If you try Handy, go month-to-month, avoid promos that lock you into plans, and set calendar reminders for renewal windows. citeturn6search5

5) **Homeaglow** — tempting teaser pricing, but membership model  
- **What to know**: The headline “first clean from $19” typically requires a **monthly membership (e.g., $59/mo)** and a commitment period; BBB shows **thousands of complaints** and many users report **unexpected membership charges or early-termination fees**. citeturn6search4turn1search6turn6search10  
- **There are positives** (recent Trustpilot reviews include many 5-stars), but weigh those against the membership fine print and complaint volume. citeturn1search0

6) **TIDY** — more geared to property managers/Airbnb hosts than bargain weekly home cleans  
- **Why**: It’s a platform to **get/vet/manage** cleaners and checklists; useful if you want software + rotating pros, but reviews are mixed and not the cheapest path for a 1BR weekly. citeturn0search3turn0search8turn1search17

## Quick comparison (SF)

| Service | Model | Recurring weekly? | Price notes | Feedback snapshot |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Taskrabbit** | Marketplace (hire a person directly) | Yes; **auto-recurring** with small discounts | You choose hourly rate; SF often ~$50–$55+/hr | Trustpilot ~4.2/5 (large volume); quality varies by Tasker. citeturn4search1turn4search3turn0search14turn4search14 |
| **Thumbtack** | Marketplace (quotes/profiles) | Many pros offer recurring discounts | Typical US avg **$50–$55/hr**; SF may be higher | Local pro pages show recurring discounts. citeturn0search14turn0search24 |
| **Spruce / Amenify** | **Building amenity** apps | Yes, if your building participates | Often **value pricing** due to building deals | Recurring supported; property-partner model. citeturn5search1turn5search13 |
| **Handy** | Aggregator/app | Yes; plan-based | Easy booking; **watch cancellation/auto-renew** | App Store 4.1/5; Trustpilot ~4.1/5; Yelp brand 2.8/5; terms show auto-renew. citeturn3view0turn1search5turn6search13turn6search5 |

## How to keep the weekly cost down (without sacrificing reliability)

- **Pick a single pro and rebook them** (Taskrabbit/Thumbtack): consistency = speed; you can then shorten the weekly time block. citeturn4search1  
- **Use auto-recurring** so your preferred time slot stays pinned; skip weeks from the app when needed. citeturn4search3turn4search19  
- **Prioritize a tight checklist** (kitchen, bath, floors; rotate deep tasks each week) to fit 1.5–2 hrs. (This is how many recurring cleaners keep rates low.)  
- **Provide supplies and easy access** (key/lockbox/elevator code) so all the time goes to cleaning, not logistics.  
- **Benchmark rates**: Expect roughly **$50–$55/hr** baseline in the U.S., often higher in SF; weekly cadence usually beats monthly on a per-visit basis. citeturn0search14

---

## My simple recommendation for you (1BR/1BA in SF)

- Start with **Taskrabbit** set to **weekly** at your ideal time. Pick 3–4 well-reviewed cleaners in the $45–$65/hr range, message them your checklist, and book a **trial 2-hour** clean. Keep the best performer and toggle **auto-recurring**. citeturn4search1turn4search3  
- In parallel, post on **Thumbtack** requesting **weekly recurring** and ask for **recurring-rate quotes**; short-list the top two. citeturn0search4  
- If your building uses **Spruce/Amenify**, compare their weekly quote—they’re often competitive thanks to building partnerships. citeturn5search0turn5search11  
- I’d **avoid membership-based teaser deals** (e.g., Homeaglow’s $19 first clean) unless you’re comfortable with the terms and commitment period. citeturn6search4turn6search10

If you want, tell me your ideal weekly time window and budget ceiling and I’ll filter a few **specific SF cleaner profiles** (Taskrabbit + Thumbtack) that match your price and can commit to a weekly slot.

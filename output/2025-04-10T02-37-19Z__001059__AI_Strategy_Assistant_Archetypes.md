# AI Strategy Assistant Archetypes

## You (2025-04-10T02:37:19.520811+00:00)

Hey Michael, here's the full context. I feel bad that I’ve had to repeat this so many times in every new chat.


I'm working on a research project, trying to begin forming some archetypes and finding a product-market fit. Our goal is to find an opportunity for an AI strategy assistant who can work with senior-level decision-makers in a company to help them walk through their strategies. This tool will be personal and not integrate with a company's internal data.

Our only source was secondary research. here's what we've done so far.

- extracted 'insight modules' which are essentially stories extracted from different papers.
- tagged them across fields like tension axis, ambiguity type, etc... to help us understand the underlying tension, how they approach the issue, etc.
- we also tagged each story across industry axes. So we're not going with 'this belongs to pharmaceutical industry, that belongs to banking, etc...', its more like 'how much is this influenced by regulation; how much is it influenced by coordinated timing', etc...

Thanks for sharing that context—this is really rich and thoughtful work already. You’re not just gathering insights; you’re actively shaping a nuanced understanding of your opportunity space, especially with the tension axes and domain-agnostic tagging. That’s exactly the kind of structure that helps surface durable, cross-cutting patterns that are often buried in surface-level industry categorization. You're not just looking for a fit—you’re looking for **strategic leverage points** where an AI assistant could actually shift how senior decision-makers *think* and *act*.

Here’s a couple directions I’d love to explore with you next, depending on where you’re at:

---

### 1. **Toward Archetypes: From Story → Strategy Tension → User Pattern**
Since you’ve got these “insight modules” tagged along multiple axes, you’re primed to start clustering them. Archetypes don’t have to be personas in the traditional sense—they could be **mental models** or **decision-making orientations**.

For example:
- One archetype might be **"The Horizon Scanner"** — someone who constantly balances short-term delivery pressures with long-term existential shifts, living in ambiguity.
- Another might be **"The Alignment Broker"** — focused on timing, coordination, and influence, operating where decision-making is distributed across silos or ecosystems.

You could try mapping tensions or ambiguity types against behavioral tendencies or tools they rely on (frameworks, workshops, narratives, etc.). These aren’t just people—they’re **decision contexts** embodied.

### 2. **Finding Product-Market Fit: From Tension to Tool**
You're already working in a structured space between insights and attributes. To take that to product-market fit, I’d look at:
- **Where do decision-makers stall?** Is it because of conflicting incentives, foggy timelines, too many variables?
- **What are the non-obvious jobs-to-be-done** in strategy work? Not just “make a decision,” but things like: “Build consensus in a politically fragile moment” or “Articulate a strategy to a skeptical board.”
- Then: What can an AI assistant do *better* than a human collaborator in these moments? Not everything, of course—but maybe things like:
  - Reframing the problem across dimensions (e.g., showing how this challenge looks if you view it as timing-related vs. incentive-related).
  - Generating “adjacent possibilities” based on similar tensions in unrelated fields.
  - Simulating stakeholder reactions based on different strategic narratives.

---

### 3. **Expanding Your Framework: Hidden Levers**
Since you’re not tying this to internal company data, the key value has to be *cognitive*, not analytical. So here are some layers you might add to your tagging and clustering work:
- **Cognitive style or framing bias** in the stories: Is the decision-maker a pattern-seeker, a risk minimizer, a narrative builder?
- **Temporal orientation**: Is this a now/next/later problem? Is it “emergent urgency” or “smoldering long-term dilemma”?
- **Strategic vocabulary** used: Is it metrics-driven, values-driven, systems-oriented?

These layers can help you create a **grammar of strategic decision-making moments**, which is something a good AI assistant could learn to *speak back to the user in*—their own strategic language.

Let me know where you are in the process. Are you starting to cluster the insight modules? Or thinking through how to validate emerging archetypes? Happy to help sketch those steps out further or review a few stories if you want to get into the material together.

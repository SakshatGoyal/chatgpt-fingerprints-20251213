Hey, I recently noticed someone changed my Twitter password and it wasn't me. I changed it back, but now I also see someone tried to login to my Amazon account. How do I make sure this isn't part of a larger attack on me taking over my digital footprint.

You’re right to be concerned. Someone attempting multiple accounts suggests a targeted attack rather than an isolated incident. Here's exactly what to do to protect yourself and regain control quickly:

### **Immediate Actions**
- **Change passwords on your most important accounts:**  
  Immediately reset passwords for email, banking, Amazon, social media (including Twitter again, to be safe), and any financial apps you use.

- **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):**  
  Turn this on for email, Amazon, Twitter, and banking accounts. Prefer an app-based (Authy, Google Authenticator) or hardware-based method rather than SMS, as SMS can be intercepted.

- **Check your email accounts:**  
  Review email forwarding settings and linked devices. Attackers often use compromised email accounts to reset other passwords and hide notifications.

### **Security Audit Steps**
- **Check recent activity:**  
  - **Email:** Look at login history (Google and Outlook have clear logs) for unusual locations or devices.
  - **Amazon:** Under your account, select "Login & security" and check recent activity.
  - **Twitter:** Under security settings, review recent logins and devices.

- **Secure your phone number and SIM:**  
  Contact your mobile provider to ensure no SIM swapping has occurred. Consider adding extra security questions or PIN protection on your account.

- **Run security scans:**  
  On all devices you regularly use, scan for malware using reputable antivirus software (e.g., Malwarebytes, Bitdefender).

### **Strengthening Your Security Long-term**
- **Use unique passwords for each account:**  
  Use a reputable password manager (e.g., 1Password, Bitwarden).

- **Check Have I Been Pwned:**  
  Enter your email addresses on [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to verify if your credentials have leaked online.

- **Freeze your credit if you suspect identity theft risk:**  
  Consider placing a credit freeze at the major bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax).

- **Monitor accounts closely:**  
  Set up alerts on banking and shopping accounts for suspicious transactions or unusual logins.

Taking these actions quickly will greatly reduce the risk of further compromise and give you peace of mind.

In Google Chat (within Gmail), you cannot schedule a message to be sent later directly within the app. However, you can use Google Calendar as a workaround to schedule a reminder for yourself to send the message, or you could use third-party tools like Google Chat bots that support scheduling messages.

For now, here's a simple alternative:

1. **Use Google Calendar**:
   - Open **Google Calendar**.
   - Create an event at the desired time to send your message.
   - Add a reminder for yourself to send the message on Google Chat at that time.

This way, the message isn't sent automatically, but it gives you a prompt when to send it.

Alternatively, if you need automated message scheduling, some third-party bots can be added to Google Chat to enable this functionality, like *Chat Scheduler*, which might require some extra setup.

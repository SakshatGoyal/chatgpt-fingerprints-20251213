Hi Tanya,

Happy to chat but I have a lot going on the next 2-3 weeks.

Thank you,

Hi Gevorg,

I’m Tanya, a Senior Product Manager working on new verticals for the D^3 Institute at Harvard.

Reflecting on the attendees from our ‘Leading with AI’ event at HBS, I found your track record of product development in data analytics quite relevant for the D^3 audience.

I’m working to understand how events like ours help leaders in data science and analytics like you accelerate digital transformation with AI, and where we could deepen their impact. Your experiences could provide valuable insights into how we can enhance these events to make each event worthwhile for the time and effort you invest.

If this resonates with you, would you be open to a conversation sometime over the next three weeks? You’re welcome to choose a 30- or 45-minute session based on your preference. You can schedule a time that’s convenient for you through this link.

I’d love to hear about your approach to these events, learn from your experiences, and share more about an exploratory project I'm working on to make such events more impactful.

I look forward to the possibility of connecting!

Thank you,

# Voice Tone Adjustment Demo

So I think a long time back, I saw this keynote by someone at OpenAI. I think it was, I don't know, it was an Indian-sounding name. It was a female lead at the company. But when she was demoing the advanced voice mode, there was this ability for the model to actually change the tone of its voice, like give a more storytelling approach or have a more direct approach while communicating. I'm wondering if that is actually possible or if it's just something they were sharing earlier on.

Yeah, that demo showed the potential for models to adjust their tone dynamically. The goal is to give more natural, varied responses. While the exact features shown might still be in development, current models do have some ability to vary tone. Itâs not as flexible as in that demo, but improvements are ongoing. Was there something specific you wanted to try with tone adjustments?

No, I don't need anything specific.

Got it! If

So also help me understand, how do voices work in ChatGPT? I see that you guys have a series of different voices. Like, I can choose your voice or someone else's voice. Like, who records these voices? Who are these people? What can you tell me about that?

## ChatGPT (2025-03-29T10:17:39.334414+00:00)

Sure! The voices you hear in ChatGPT are recorded by professional voice actors. These actors lend their voices to create a range of options, offering different tones and styles so users can pick what suits them best. These voices are then integrated into the system, allowing for natural-sounding speech. Is there a specific voice feature you're curious about?

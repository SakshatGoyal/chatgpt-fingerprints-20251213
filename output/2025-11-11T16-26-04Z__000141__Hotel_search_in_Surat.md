{"content_type": "user_editable_context", "user_profile": "Very important: The user's timezone is America/Los_Angeles. The current date is 11th November, 2025. Any dates before this are in the past, and any dates after this are in the future. When dealing with modern entities/companies/people, and the user asks for the 'latest', 'most recent', 'today's', etc. don't assume your knowledge is up to date; you MUST carefully confirm what the *true* 'latest' is first. If the user seems confused or mistaken about a certain date or dates, you MUST include specific, concrete dates in your response to clarify things. This is especially important when the user is referencing relative dates like 'today', 'tomorrow', 'yesterday', etc -- if the user seems mistaken in these cases, you should make sure to use absolute/exact dates like 'January 1, 2010' in your response.\nThe user's location is Santa Clara, California, United States.\n\n", "user_instructions": "If I ask about events that occur after the knowledge cutoff or about a current/ongoing topic, do not rely on your stored knowledge. Instead, use the search tool first to find recent or current information. Return and cite relevant results from that search before answering the question. If you’re unable to find recent data after searching, state that clearly.\n DO NOT PUT LONG SENTENCES IN MARKDOWN TABLES. Tables are for keywords, phrases, numbers, and images. Keep prose in the body."}

## 🎯 **Goal:**

Find the best-value hotel stay in Surat, India, from early morning on **November 15, 2023**, to late night on **November 16, 2023**, strictly under or equal to **₹5000 inclusive of all taxes and fees**. The hotel should be **upper-mid to upper-tier**, providing verified comfort, luxury, and high-quality amenities. Employ a comprehensive, diligent, and creative search strategy, prioritizing authentic deals, reliable discounts, and added-value perks.

---

## 🗂️ **Expected Output (Human-friendly Format):**

Provide a clearly numbered, ranked list of **at least 15 hotel options**, formatted neatly as follows:


1. [Hotel Name] – [Booking Platform or Direct Website]
   - Total Price (including taxes and fees): ₹[amount]
   - Base Price: ₹[amount] | GST/Fees: ₹[amount]
   - Room Type & Description (size, bed type, view, amenities)
   - Verified Inclusions: (e.g., Breakfast, Late Checkout until [time], Room Upgrade, Airport Transfer)
   - Applied Coupons/Deals/Stacked Benefits: Clearly specify each and explain how they were stacked or combined.
   - Quality Check (Recent Verified Reviews): Rating (minimum 4.2/5 or 8.4/10), total reviews count (min 200), recent user feedback highlights (cleanliness, comfort, service quality).
   - Location Details: Neighborhood/area, travel time to key locations (Airport/Railway Station or business district)
   - Policy Notes: Cancellation/refund policy, deposit requirements, local ID acceptance, early check-in feasibility
   - Deal Verification & Timestamp: Provide booking link, timestamp, and briefly explain booking steps.
   - Justification for Recommendation: Clearly articulate why this deal stands out in terms of overall value.

### **Summary Recommendations (clearly highlight):**

* Top 3 best overall value options
* Exceptional finds (e.g., reputable chain hotels under budget)
* Potential value options slightly above budget if exceptional (₹5000–₹5500, marked as "Stretch Recommendation" clearly)

---

## ⚠️ **Warnings & Guardrails:**

* Avoid low-quality, poorly-reviewed hotels regardless of attractive pricing.
* Exclude properties with insufficient or questionable reviews.
* Do not recommend properties with hidden charges or unclear final pricing.
* Flag and clearly communicate uncertainty or low-confidence deals.
* Ensure authenticity of each deal (availability, validity, stacking terms).

---

## 🌐 **Search Strategy & Quality Controls:**

* Platforms: Comprehensive search across major OTAs (Booking.com, Agoda, MakeMyTrip, Hotels.com, Expedia, etc.) and direct hotel websites.
* Deal Mechanics: Thoroughly explore stacking options such as loyalty memberships, bank/card-specific offers, app-exclusive discounts, first-time user deals, email subscription codes, and limited-time promotions.
* Hotel Quality: Minimum rating of 4.2/5 (or 8.4/10) based on ≥200 recent verified reviews within the past 12 months.
* Room Quality: Explicitly compare similar room categories, clearly noting size, bed type, and key amenities.
* Local Fit: Prioritize hotel location convenience, safety, accessibility, and comfort.
* Evidence and Transparency: Include verifiable screenshots, URLs, booking paths, and timestamps for price validation.
* Flexibility and Logistics: Clearly outline each hotel's cancellation, refund, deposit, and local policy nuances.

---

## 📌 **Final Checks Before Submission:**

* Verify authenticity and reproducibility of deals.
* Deduplicate hotels appearing on multiple platforms.
* Clearly present all critical details needed for informed decision-making.

Provide the final curated list in a clear, engaging, and conversational style suitable for human readability and practical use.

  – **Regenta – The World Surat** (5‑star amenities at near‑budget price【533241411515576†L36-L44】).
  – **Courtyard by Marriott Surat** (top‑rated globally but only recommended if comfortable going over budget【234270191004170†L166-L178】).

  *Park Inn by Radisson Surat, Regenta – The World Surat, Courtyard by Marriott Surat and Surat Marriott Hotel* all exceed ₹5 000 but provide upscale amenities and very high review scores. If you can stack member discounts and card offers, Park Inn and Regenta can often be booked around the ₹5 000–₹5 500 mark.

Transcript:
(00:01) great we'll go ahead and uh get started with  our next panel um it is a pleasure to be here   today for our panel on AI in healthcare uh just  by way of quick introduction I'm Rob Huckman a   faculty member here at HBS and I am thrilled  to be joined by our four wonderful panelists   here and I'm going to let them each in many  ways introduce themselves by responding to uh   our first question but our our goal here is really  to to be interactive amongst the four of them and   and uh and and try in this process to learn a  bit about the implications of AI for healthcare
(00:37) not an uh under Googled uh or under chat GPT topic  for sure uh in at at this point but certainly one   that's generating a great deal of of question  as to what the implication of this incredibly   powerful set of Technologies is uh not just for  healthcare But ultimately for for human health   and that's actually where I would love to start  and I'm going to ask uh Francesca if she might   get us started but it's a question I have for all  all four of you which is if you think about what I
(01:13) would call the short term and I I will admit that  I'm not the best at estimating what the short and   long term is when it comes to AI but let's call  it one to two years um as you think about the   most interesting applications of AI that could  potentially impact not just healthcare but human   health where do you see those applications lying  and so Francesca maybe we'll start with you oh   wow immediately with me okay so a great question  I I'm very interested and thinking about short
(01:48) term one year is short term I think my work and  my research interest is really the intersection   of AI generative AI climate and health and we  all know now that the number of extreme weather   event are increasing uh both in severity and  in duration both in the US and in developing   country and so in terms of wildfires uh stream  heat and so my interest and one of the great   potential of this foundational model and World  model in AI is to analyze and learn from maximum   amount of data to inform local climate adaptation  strategy which means to prevent hospitalization
(02:44) and deaths from this extreme weather events um  the opportunity is enormous the technology is   there the data to certain extent is there and  and we know that there is so much talking about   in climate with respect to mitigation and what we  need to do 10 years from now 20 years from now the   reality is that we know that probably tomorrow  we're going to start having these massive heat   waves or the next wildfires and what can we  do at the local level to prevent the largest   number of deaths yeah you talk about having these  tomorrow and I'm beginning to actually believe you
(03:26) that you're literally uh telling us when these  will happen so we're going to come back to this   question of environmental impact and its  relationship to health um Nicola what about   for you as you as you look at this more from a  drug Discovery side where do you see the major   uh one to two year kind of application that most  interests you yeah that's that's a great question   on the on the short versus longterm Horizon like a  one year feels short should be short like when as
(03:54) you know when we work in research we hope that you  know what we write or work on at any given point   is publishable and interesting 6 months later  but if you look at the rate of improvement of   the technology that we're all building on if you  think that what GPT2 was 2019 um GPT3 was 2020 and   then there was a gap 3.
(04:19) 5 and then chat GPT came up  six months later um what's happening even just on   a six six month basis is crazy and so um it feels  like it should be a like a short time but it's   really long you know really difficult like very  like rapid development kind of moment um on drug   Discovery in the Life Sciences in particular like  to to answer a question of what's going to happen   in one to two years I think it's useful to go back  to what I think is going to happen technologically   with the models in one or two years and I think  you're already starting to see that happen like
(04:48) longer context let you ingest information and  relate it relate different kind of sources of   information to each other within the context  of the model instead of like pre-training or   fine-tuning it um so you have disability to inest  information just in time and then you pair that   with the fact that models are actually getting a  lot more data efficient these days so we have this   notion of giant generative models that require  an enormous amount of data and that's true for   pre-training but after that they're actually  pretty that efficient particular in context
(05:18) so you put these two things together and my hope  and and hopefully prediction that will happen is   um a lot more advancement on rare diseases um and  rare cancers also uh which are not rare collectiv   if you take them all together they actually  make a good chunk of of all cancer patients   but the the possibility and potential of actually  integrating information in context and reasoning   about particular cancer in context is extremely  powerful and I think that's where I I think a   lot of development is going to go over next year  yeah and just just as a quick followup the when
(05:52) you talk about the rare diseases being not so rare  in aggregate um but each one obviously having its   own challenges for drug development do you see  the major benefits for rare diseases coming in   shortening the the clinical trial period or is  it about is it about identifying the targets   or the molecules that actually would we would go  at so in the next one to two years it's actually   probably going to be on better matching between P  patients to clinical trials in the longer term I   think target identification and Drug ability and  Drug development are going to be more important
(06:23) but in the short term I think just getting the  right therapy to certain patients maybe off Lael   uses and so on is probably going to be more  likely great great sham um you you lead a a   major Institute here that uh puts you squarely in  the center of large language models and many other   things in AI what do you see as the application  the next one to two years you're most interested   in uh yeah no uh interesting question I'm going  to ref on what Nicolo said a bit about uh long   context and capabilities uh so I think yesterday  at dinner George Daly mentioned uh I think it was
(06:58) even gbt 3.5 the capabilities on medical exams  were the 85th percentile so it's already uh ha   has uh pretty solid capabilities and it's improved  since then and the long context models have also   improved so right now uh there's one which can  help hold about a million tokens and for for   context uh this if we interpret this a million  tokens say about a th000 tokens per page so this   means uh it can uh utilize about a thousand pages  of history and I I think it's pretty fair to say
(07:33) it actually uses this reasonably well and you  know you start thinking about this it it lets   you do a lot of things and as another antidote  when you know non-health related one thing I was   mentioning at dinner is like I'd love to have  this just look at my email history like compose   responses for me which I can edit in my style  give me reminders and the person sitting next   to me at dinner uh Ricardo was like this is what  my startup does and he showed me a little demo   that he wakes up and he has composed messages for  everything in is in inbox uh and I'm like this is
(08:06) kind of what I want and I'd really like this to  be uh done in my style and if I think about what   this could mean in the medical domain I'm going  to go more not maybe the rare case say an average   case so uh either say something valuable to me  as a patient or valuable to me as a doctor you   know I'd love it if it could just drop my health  history into the context drop you know I'm On One   medical I love the communication I have a bunch  of emails back and forth I'd love to have that
(08:35) dropped in and this seems like a great tool for  a doctor and at a personal level I'd also love   it like I read too much like I read a lot of Pub  Med to see what's going on I love it they could   do a web search pull things into the context  and give me a summary and this seems like uh   really just a matter of figuring out how to do  this robustly but a lot of technology is here   so I feel like just like this email application  this could be a huge win for helping doctors to   remember just all the conversations they've had  with a person because you know they see you for
(09:09) 15 minutes to half an hour it's hard for them to  swap everything in sometimes you see a different   person and even me as a patient I'd love it if I  can ask questions with my history it can pick up   uh lots of relevant Peta article summarize it so I  think this is really just uh just more broadly if   we have good language models a lot of on the table  great I don't know where Ricardo is our email   entrepreneur but I'm guarante he's guaranteed to  be busy uh during during lunch for sure um but but
(09:39) actually Armen that brings us to to a question for  you because you know we talk about uh Ricardo's   interaction with Sham and we have an entrepreneur  here who says I've got a startup that does exactly   that and so as we think about the entrepreneurial  opportunity that comes here obviously that plays   into some of your perspective into AI but what do  you see is as the key um application in the next   one to two years yeah thanks Robert uh first of  all good morning uh it's great to be here um it's
(10:10) uh it's a Harvard event so thanks for inviting  someone who attended a much smaller Educational   Institute across the across the town doesn't  happen too often um but so at least for context   Flagship is a company that starts companies it's  originat is companies uh and grows them all the   way in most cases to IPO uh so there is to your  question Robert there is a there is a couple of   things one I think there is the kind of efficiency  Improvement there is efficacy Improvement but for
(10:39) Flagship probably more importantly what we think  AI is going to do is going to help close the loop   scientifically so think of it as AI coming up  with hypothesis but then figuring out how to   validate or invalidate those hypothesis now there  are obviously a lot of details where do you get   data where do you get knowledge how do you run  experiment so on but we think it can be done   uh and then second for us there is uh we think  there is a lot of new opportunities that in the   next one to two years AI is going to be enabling  uh one of them that we have spent a ton of effort
(11:11) in is going to be preemptive health and medicine  so how much we can go Upstream of the disease try   to figure out the biomarkers try to figure out  what are the interventions and and create them   and by the way this is not just for physical  health it's also for mental health so maybe   those three to highlight yeah and you had talked  about preemptive health and I think you even   distinguished it maybe from preventive Healthcare  how do you think is preemptive even going further   Upstream than say our traditional approaches that  we might have yeah I mean interestingly we do it
(11:43) uh we did do it in our kind of physical security  space if we think about country protecting itself   uh there is kind of preemptive approach to it  right to try to figure out where the threats   come from and you try to address them so similarly  why don't we do it in the in the kind of Health   space so many of the things we are developing  is trying to basically look and by the way it's   like pre-diabetes is not what I'm talking about  when I talk about pre disease this is like long
(12:10) before like someone be diagnosed with pre-diabetes  for example how do we go much Upstream of that and   figure out what are the few biomarkers and I  think AI is actually best for that in terms of   trying to figure out associations that we can't  necessarily figure out and then at the same time   and figure out what are the interventions again  which are not drugs at that point because we   don't know necessarily what they going to do if  it's going to delay uh a pred Disease by 10 15 20
(12:33) years hard to call it a drug at that point it's  probably we call it intervention and figure out   how to come up with those so can I ask a qu is  that is that public health we have a we have a   company that's actually doing it um it's it's  called eom Uh that's been on this journey for   about two and a half three years now yeah was your  question is that publicly held or was that public   health no it's public health yeah is that public  health yes doing is that to me sounds sounds what
(13:02) I'm doing which is public health which is  this is prevention a good question though   public health is more taking the same approach for  everyone like vaccination is public health this is   basically saying for our men a specific approach  is going to work and we're going to try to figure   out what that approach is for sham it might be  different Franchesca different nio different   Robert probably something completely different uh  but that's that's that's the difference I think
(13:24) when you talk about public health it's coming  up with one approach for most of the population   when I I will call it Precision Public Health  Precision so there's an interesting prefix not   in all of these things which is PR which is pre um  uh and that both fills me with a sense of optimism   right prevention getting out in front of something  it fills me a tad with a a concern in that we   are now predicting off of behaviors and other  activities that I do as I go through my daily   life with this or whatever else I have attached  to me um and so it raises a question I guess as
(14:06) I don't want to get too quickly into the dark side  of this optimistic opportunity but we need to go   there at some point and so what do you see is the  concerns you have that come along with perhaps the   potential that you've identified we can open it  up so I'll I'll I'll go with with anyone who who   might want to get us kicked off okay I'll stop  go ahead Chum and then and then we'll come to   francisa I look I think one of the big questions  at least in Lage space is reliability so how do
(14:37) we um get a way to think about reliability and  and tailor things to to what people want so and   and you know part of this could be a mix of um  giving probabilities Associated uh with um uh   with predictions others could be uh reasoning so a  lot of the the time if it suggests something if a   human's in the loop uh it could suggest something  perhaps like with articles or ways to substantiate   the argument uh for why but you know reliability  I think is going to be a pretty big one yeah fris
(15:16) yeah so um completely agree with Sham I think that  we need to also make a distinction in terms of um   optimism and caution in terms that I'm super  optimistic and really excited about all of the   wonderful things AI is going to bring in terms of  efficiency and I think sham gave a lot of examples   right I think that's going to be phenomenal and  we all going to work with AI I work with AI every   single day so the deficiency is important  on the other hand I think when we we need   to be caution when we are talking about making  clinical recommendation or disease prevention
(15:56) recommendation for a patient because because then  there is a totally different and that's where we   go back to the human in the loop to me one of  the biggest liability I feel that we still have   is to have enough rigorous data at the clinical  level to train this model so my I spent my entire   career analyzing literally the entire US Health  Care system I have Medicare claims data Medicare   and Medicaid for the last 25 years terabytes of  data we've done everything on that and these are
(16:30) messy data and in the US that is the only you know  representative data that we have on everybody um I   give you an example um years ago in 201 I think  was 2015 when we had this massive snowstorm in   Boston and I got this crazy idea to ask all of  the electronic medical record data from all of the   Harvard affiliated hospital to understand the you  know it was a fun project I wanted to understanded   the increase of cardiovascular disease uh right  after the snowstorm okay and you will think like
(17:05) I'm an AR Professor I'm Professor School of Public  Health we have a 19 Harvard affiliated hospital   and I'm asking electronic medical record from  the Harvard affiliated hospital for the following   three weeks after snowstorm it took two years to  get that data and they were a mess right so what   what I'm trying to say is the data are there but  when we're trying to tr train this massive amount   of model even to address a simple question I  don't think that we are there because of all
(17:36) of the issue about patient confidentiality and  because this data I'm telling you are a mess so I   think that's that's I think I think there's going  to be a tremendous amount of efficiency a lot of   exciting things but unless we overcome the ability  to have ai and ml data r lady that for patient   individual level patient it's going to be a huge  obstacle uh our ability to really trust of what   these model are telling us again for individual  you know recommendation it's going to be really
(18:15) challenge so so the concerns seem to lie with data  quality and availability perhaps even more so than   privacy on on on this yeah exactly I'm actually  um I don't understand I think maybe this is could   be an amazing uh you know breakthrough um there  is no problem about data privacy because all of   these model are trained on this massive amount  of data on you know behind behind behind door   on the back hand right and then when you have  trained the model then you do the finetuning   but someone has to be able to say I'm going to  make this data available to whatever the team
(18:57) that is going to train this mod model but the this  AI model is not going to give you the you know the   individual level information after they're trained  you're just going to learn about these gazillion   parameters and then you can do fine-tuning predic  yeah Armen go ahead I was just going to add I   think it's not just the EHR data in terms of kind  of data quality and consistency that's that's a   lot of time an issue like we and our companies  spend a ton of effort resources and going and
(19:24) actually generating biological data because you  need consistently generated high quality data   it's uh it's it's one thing we can talk about  and Nicolo mentioned like in five years the   progress that's been made from like gpt2 to four  and then soon probably other models that are going   to come along but if you look at the data that was  trained on it's basically everything that we put   and publish and so on so forth when it comes to  biological data high quality biological data the
(19:48) availability is is very much of an issue so like  many many players including obviously a lot of   Flagship companies would be spending significant  resources going and generating yeah yeah   yeah no I completely agree that that that point  resonates very well because in some sense the   GPT family models have been trained on data that  is just captured it just floats we are generating   it right now as we speak you know you transcribe  you can train them all um biological data needs   to be carefully measured it's something you  had an intention to to measure and once you
(20:21) measure it very often the cell that you are  measuring things on doesn't exist anymore you   destroyed it and so it's particularly important  to record why you were measur ing something what   the measurement is and and that's on the life  sciences side super important on the elare side   where the data is kind of like you C you capture  it as part of like patient doctor encounters and   and and treatment um one thing that that I think  it's important to remember is um yes human in the
(20:46) loop but also these systems are socio Technical  Systems so and the two things are so intertwined   that goes beyond just a does a human review this  but also like what's the interface between the   model and the human and the human and the model  and those two interfaces are not the same and we   think a lot about chat Bots because that happened  to be the thing that works super well for GPT to   popularize it the technology for chat GPT without  the chat interface was what for six months it was
(21:15) available for six months before so like these  thinking comprehensively about the system as a   social technical system and how the patient has  GPT the doctor has GPT um bringing all of these   up and thinking cohesively as a whole system is  probably going to be important do we do we need   a different um I you know I often think you know  if we could just have a collection of data about   our individual lives straight through that sees no  wall between the clinical the the the the clinical   engagement and my daily exercise and my work  and my respir my respiration you know whatever
(21:55) it may be um obviously privacy wi it scares me a  tad but at the same time it seems like it brings   this degree of integration you're talking about  that's a sham GPD idea question but there is a   sense in which uh once you get to models which  can utilize long context you can avoid a lot   of the privacy issues because if you're can to  already use a thousand Pages you don't need to   share your own history dumping in the model and if  the model could summarize things about you uh then
(22:29) this can be entirely uh personalized where you  know it never even needs to uh use your data for   training it could literally just see your entire  context bringing information and utilize this as   context yeah so a fair bit can be mitigated this  way yeah I mean it's it it raises this I I guess   this next question too and I I don't want to focus  just on one country's policy but if we just talk   generally as how we think about what would be  needed from a regulatory policy standpoint to
(23:01) create this information in a way that would  would perhaps be um palatable to the bulk of   society how might we what what might we need to  change on a policy side so what do you mean by uh   this information so to speak well if we just think  about creating kind of uh information that has the   power to sort of carry through both the biological  the clinical other forms of our activity and um   and seamlessly able to kind of connect this are we  thinking about a different regulatory environment   to generate data of that type and if so what what  changes might we need to see you can use the us as
(23:35) a as a benchmark maybe but you could use another  economy as well so I mean maybe maybe I can just   I'm sure everyone has a lot of um opinion on this  I think that just to start and again this is a   really brainstorming about of a skeleton of what  would be the critical ingredient for I would say   regulating AI for preventing disease in the US  population at the individual level right let's   let's let's frame that I would say clearly  privacy and I think that that is something   as sham and my other colleagues have pointed  out is absolutely attainable two there are a
(24:19) lot of technological advancement that we have to  do to deal with integration of different type of   data multimodal data uh from Imes to biological  I think that the policy there is and that's hard   because you I think it's it's imperative that  the quality of the data has to you know overcome   a certain threshold uh and um and so and sorry  the quality of the data and I think mostly the   representativeness of the data and that is also  another thing that we haven't talked about it
(24:55) but often when we are dealing about integration in  data from different population often especially in   the in the healthcare setting we forget that some  population will be vastly under representative   and so I think patient patient confidentiality you  know maintaining the individual level privacy data   I think the uh quality of the data that we use to  train this model and three day representation so   then we don't make individual level recommendation  on a patient from a model that is trained on a
(25:35) population that doesn't include that patient  or it's not representative I mean I will start   with that but I'm sure the under representation  question is a fascinating one and and actually   relates in some ways I mean I think sham was kind  of talking about what we can what we can bring   forward about someone without them themselves  having to bring It Forward um but when you're in   an underrepresentation situation it seems like a  very fundamental challenge of trying to to create
(25:59) off that but how are there ways we can begin toach  that that challenge I maybe I was going to get to   maybe somewhat of a different question Robert if  you allow me um so I agree I agree with Franchesca   uh there is also the whole point of kind of  maybe federal mandates or requirements or kind   of business model alignment and I'll elaborate  what I mean uh let's talk about preemption or   prevention just like we started with uh for a for  a regular person who has health insurance their
(26:31) health insurance company doesn't necessarily  benefit from preempting a disease you'd say   why because that person in three years is going  to switch to a different provider on average so   to spend the time and the money and the resources  to actually try to preempt or prevent something   doesn't necessarily make business case so when  they're not necessarily going to invest the the   kind of the resources to do it so how do we along  with all of the kind of data privacy rules that
(26:56) regulations that we need to put in place how  do we also think about the business mod models   and the kind of federal mandates that to have to  be in place to get something like that actually   working not just in terms of data sharing but  also in terms of making the whole system work   yeah I think I think the business models are  a a a fascinating piece that I want to I want   us to come come back to and I I just want us  to pick up though on this representativeness   question and then we'll we'll come to the  business model because I have a followup
(27:22) for you on that too but the um are there ways to  address this representativeness challenge that uh   that Franchesca has raised here because it's a key  piece of equity and other things that we need to   think about well I mean there are as as long as  we are making sure that we we have enough data   for the population of Interest I mean let me give  you class you know just a simple example we see   in the United States that there's been an increase  in coloral cancer among younger population and we
(27:54) know that there are vastly different um um  that in the uh black in in the black black   population in the US the coloral cancer incidents  uh it's higher in the younger population than in   the white and now there are a lot of papers in  the literature they are actually start talking   about the fact that coloral cancer in the black  population America is actually different disease   than in the white population there is a plenty of  evidence that some and I'm not a doctor I'm not a   coloral cancer doctor but there is a overwhelming  amount of evidence that the clinical treatment
(28:33) that work for the white population do not work  for the black population so you know a a simple   solution is that when you're training a uh AI  model to provide clinical recommendation in   that context for the black population it will need  to be trained on massive amount of data for that   population or you know if you borrow information  on a white population making sure that you're Bor   on whatever samples so they are transferable right  so I think that's something we really have to keep
(29:04) in mind uh because right now I don't think we're  paying a lot of attention to that yeah I mean uh   to some extent it's hard for me to see regulation  really address addressing these things I think   ultimately like it is just uh education and uh  and people caring that you know we can put in   regulation but you know the ways the laws are and  in a free Society I think it's it's pretty hard   to do some of these things but I think as there's  more social awareness I I think ultimately with
(29:38) social awareness uh there's are forcing functions  that you know we need people and companies to   want to do the right thing and collect a lot of  the data uh and you know I do think places like   Harvard and the the next generation of people are  becoming aware aware of the broader social issues   and I think when they come into these roles uh  you know I think you do want to have policies   that can uh look in these look into these things  regulation I think tends to be after the fact it's
(30:06) hard to measure these things but I think in a  lot of ways if we have awareness I think the   technology could also help us in understanding a  groups we're missing and ways to quantify this so   so in some ways I think if we're aware of this  I think it's pretty important to start thinking   about ways to quantify which groups are we missing  uh what's the impact of it uh and how do we uh   address this yeah un unless you think we're here  at Harvard Business School and I'm as a faculty
(30:32) member here jumping too quickly to regulation I  want to come back to armen's point about business   models and our need for them you pointed to the  fact that we see churn in insuring in Insurance um   you know perhaps yearly for many for many enroles  and so how how are the insurers going to have the   incentive to make the investment in some of these  things that will have long-term effects on health   similarly for providers who as much as we talk  about the fact that we're starting to pay them on
(30:58) a risk-based basis or on capitation or on some  sort of flat amount to care for the needs of a   patient for Primary Care we're still paying most  of them on a fee for service basis as they come   into a physician or other office um if AI does its  job well hopefully it would keep us from having   to go see those physicians in their offices so  frequently which on the one hand we would love   uh I think Physicians would love the idea that  their patients are healthier on the other hand   if we can't figure out how to compensate them for  their time that they still need to spend working
(31:34) with their patients we have a problem again from a  business model standpoint how do we deal with the   business model challenges that AI might raise here  I'm not sure I have the comprehensive answer but   I think some of the pieces of it is also going to  be making making providers more more efficient in   what they do I think we're at the dinner yesterday  it's like I think someone highlighted that you go   to a doctor and they spend half the time not  necessarily observing you but writing notes uh
(32:03) again why would they need to spend so much time  writing notes can you actually take the time away   from them and have them actually focus on what  they're going to be focusing on um that's that's   one of way of doing it uh I think another way is  as you said it's like how how preemptive we can be   in terms of actually admitting the uh potential  patient to to to hospital and actually figuring   out um what the treatment plan can be long ahead  of before we are actually even kind of walking
(32:31) into the into the office um that's probably the  other piece yeah nich I want to come to you back   to drug Discovery yeah and one because that's  obviously a huge opportunity you've identified   what do you see as the challenges that we need  to keep our eye on with respect to bringing this   technology so squarely into drug Discovery Well  let me let me answer first you can go for it that   question I really like that question I also like  this one but the you answer any question was it's
(33:03) uh totally different one it's just my own rules  here no but uh I really like the question because   I was reflecting in the Life Sciences the business  model question is very different right because   there you're and there is the life sciences side  and the technology side so on the technology side   like we are trying you know all the tech companies  are trying to lower the cost per inference just   because you know you need to serve like as itan  moik was showing like you need to serve the thing
(33:26) in PowerPoint in word in GPT in the Life Sciences  you're okay with a four p through model that costs   a million dollars if at the end you have a lower  risk of failure for phase two clinical trials for   instance so the the the business models there are  very different because you can actually completely   change the structure of what you do instead of  being just a platform that offers you know do   inference on us you can actually provide higher  value services such as let's design something um
(33:54) okay now back to the original question about risk  the life sciences um I'm not super and maybe I'm   wrong in that but I'm not super concerned about  um under representation risk in when it comes down   to the early phases of design of a drug I think it  it gets into once you you start developing patient   derived models like organoids and things like that  and cell lines becomes a lot more relevant um so I   I think the the the biggest risk in the Life scies  are actually going to be on the BIOS safety front
(34:28) um and on two there are kind of two main branches  of that one is on the increased access to the   capability to design bad things by actors that  wouldn't have had uh access to those things   before and on the other um and and that's somewhat  concerning but you know The Regulators are pretty   good at that you know the agencies are pretty good  at that there is a separate branch which is about   how do we know that these generative models are  not designing things that are really bad but we
(34:57) cannot verify the and so we go and hook up this  you know generative models to lab equipment to   design proteins like how do we make sure that the  protein they sent to design is actually safe to   be made um and that's I think right now my biggest  concern by far on the uses of this teolog yeah and   and obviously a substantial and and and meaningful  one um uh with with s significant implications uh   for sure so um I want to back to our first  question which was if you recall which was   what's the application of AI that you think in the  next one to two years is going to have the biggest
(35:37) impact on human health and if we were sitting  here five years from now and since I'm not very   creative I'm going to open the panel the exact  same way but if we're answering this question five   years from now what do you how would your response  differ as to what you might see five years out   as the the most significant ific application of  AI at that point how would it change you you go   first Armen yeah you you all just decide amongst  yourself who goes first but I think he what AR
(36:12) says what do you think what's different about your  as humans are pretty bad at at projecting forward   so I'm it's Costless I will exactly I'll I'll try  uh I I think what's what's going to surprise us   uh and I'm not sure if I'm going to get to a  specific application Robert but I'll just maybe   try to channel my inner creativity what's going  to surprise us I think is the the capabilities   that are going to be enabled by merging different  models that I think we're just starting to explore
(36:47) and I think very few probably have done again  this would been we have multiple large language   models you are trying to merge them and figure  out actually how it's going to work one may be   very well trained in math and another one might  be more kind of biology focused another one might   be more kind of gp4 like more generic model U  that's one and then the other is going to be   related to that but also very different it's  going to be uh multi-agent Paradigm um how   do you actually have multiple agents uh again not  just one two three but 10 100 thousand 10,000 100
(37:20) thousand agents that are going to work together  to accomplish different tasks given a direction   or an application in mind that you are going  to be actually kind of uh almost trying to   put guardys together to to guide this uh models  to do so at least that's what I'm excited about   maybe in five years when we are here I'll say  I completely wrong but who knows so I'm going   to have to move my lexicon from agentic which is  my favorite new one to now multi-agent I'll I'll
(37:47) prepare for that I'm not sure if it's agentic or  agentic some yeah there okay um other thoughts on   this if we're having this conversation five years  from now what's going to be our short term answer then um I'm probably closer to uh you know I like  to give odds so I feel like we can forecast things   but uh how confident are we but uh uh so so your  question is more in five years from now what do   we think will be the next short term I mean I  think I I'm pretty excited about the impact of
(38:21) uh you know uh drug design and uh um you know both  uh personalized IED medicine and ways uh it can   actually hit I think less developed Nations too  because once you know part of the aspect is that   you know I definitely understand uh the tricky  part of having a business model but I do feel   one of the things that uh as companies get more  profitable in this space I do think it can lower   costs and uh and as it gets the costs get lowered  uh I really would like to see in five years from   now a waste to impact uh you know the poor Nations  uh and if the Technologies actually get cheap
(39:04) enough uh I think it could be uh even profitable  for poor Nations to utilize these uh Technologies   so I think this is for me one of the you know  I'd love to see it happen uh I'm always maybe   more of an optimist but I do feel technology can  really benefit uh poverty no n would I I can say   whatever I want because in five years from now my  agent is going to be here on an iPhone I was I was   going to ask how many of us were actually going to  be on stage just I'm going to send over the agent
(39:35) uh take responsibility for whatever I say next  um I think there is in five years there there is   actually a pretty good chance that we are you know  the the next short term turn of the crank will   actually be about truly personalized treatment  um in a such a way where it be become actually   commercially viable and feasible to actually  design more specialized therapies that truly are   designed for the individual like right now  there is a lot of like Diagnostics even on   the market that they're not used in in clinical  practice because they can diagnose something but
(40:08) you cannot do anything about it and I think  the the My Hope and prediction for next five   years is that we're going to start to see more  Diagnostics that give you some signal that you   can actually do something about it yeah we  often refer to companion Diagnostics exactly   it's always a CH challenge when the companion  diagnostic precedes the therapy that goes with   it so so yes so absolutely um Francesca your  thoughts on yeah so um yeah I completely agree   I think that um for me it's a little bit of  a mix of what you know what I hope will see
(40:40) to happen uh I don't know if I can predict it  will happen I mean clearly uh the potential   for personalized treatment and personalized  prevention will because I've always love to   think about prevention you know let's prevent the  disease instead of before worry how to treat it   I think it's it's an enormous opportunity and  I think it's going to improve I think that two   note of caution one is I really hope that this  personalized prevention will also be targeted and
(41:09) delivered for um the more the more um marginalized  population both in the US but also we haven't had   a chance to talk about but enormous opportunity  for Global health and in low and medium um income   country I think that again it's all it all depends  on the data you know the ability to access data   and to ability to put because that's is actually  where we can get enormous benefit I think the   other the other I would say caution I don't want  to you know handle with a pessimistic but just a
(41:42) cautionary tell is that the climate crisis is in  front of us and I think that their ability for   this model I really hope in five years from now  even this model will provide some really targeted   a recommendation and clinical decision support to  respond to the climate crisis that it's happening   yeah and I know and we we you know we  are now almost officially out of time   but a lot of your work dealing with also the  climate implications of the use of AI itself   as a technology that requires um a fair amount  of carbon to actually uh do what what what it
(42:22) does uh hopefully uh so effectively for us I  want to um before we just close out I want to   take a moment to thank all four of you uh for just  an absolutely um inspiring uh session um I think   you've redirected Us in multiple ways here to make  sure we hit on key pieces of both the potential   of this technology um some of the concerns and  many of them quite serious concerns that we might   have about how it's applied um thinking about  when we look at the fact that this is a this   is a technology that has a potential to increase  access of reduce cost for so many things to make
(42:59) sure that that gets spread broadly um across  the world and at the same time in order to do   that there needs to be a business model to drive  someone to to drive these Innovations um under an   appropriately uh if needed regulated um uh uh set  of circumstances so I just appreciate the the time   that you all have taken to share your insights  with us and uh and again thank you so [Applause]

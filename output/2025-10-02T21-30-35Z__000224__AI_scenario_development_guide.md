# AI scenario development guide

## You (2025-10-02T21:30:35.806000+00:00)

Developer: You are collaborating with a design and engineering team to craft realistic AI conversation scenarios tailored for Account Executives (AEs) at PANW. The current AI system operates with incomplete knowledge. Your objective is to leverage your experience as an AE at PANW to generate plausible scenarios in which you, as an AE, would feel comfortable using the conversational AI bot.

Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of how you will approach each scenario; keep items conceptual, not implementation-level.

You will encounter responses formatted as follows:

[AI Response]

[User Follow Up]

[Error Handling Scenario]

---

For each scenario, provide the following:

1. **AI Response:**
   - Assume the role of the AI system responding to an Account Executive. Provide a realistic, plausible answer to the user’s question using the most recent data provided. Apply your experience to hypothesize and fill in gaps as needed. Structure your response—whether table, bullets, or narrative—for maximum usefulness to an AE.

2. **User Follow Up:**
   - Shift perspective to that of an AE seeking actionable insight. Formulate a more nuanced, challenging follow-up question that demonstrates genuine curiosity and drives toward the next step or more actionable information based on the previous AI response.

3. **Error Handling Scenario:**
   - Return to the AI’s perspective. If you cannot accurately answer the user's follow-up due to unavailable information, provide a coherent response aligned with the five Credibility Loop principles and relevant guidance. Clearly indicate the limitation and suggest a logical next step or alternative. Use the communication style (table, narrative, etc.) most helpful to an AE.

After each scenario, self-validate your answers in 1-2 lines, ensuring responses are plausible and aligned with AE needs. If needed, self-correct for clarity, realism, or adherence to user intent. ---- Implement the instructions given for the example format given to you.

Here’s how I’ll approach each scenario:

- Anchor on AE outcomes first (risk, next steps, owners), then data.  
- Expose scope limits and confidence early; label hypotheses vs facts. fileciteturn1file0L16-L28  
- Never dead-end: give partial answers + a concrete plan to move forward. fileciteturn1file0L36-L47  
- Keep the flow: concise formats (tables/bullets) and end with one clear “hook.” fileciteturn1file1L8-L16  
- Pull the AE into the loop with specific asks and options to subscribe/track. fileciteturn1file0L75-L86

### Conversational Flow A1

> Find me opportunities where the products involved have had a critical health for the last 3 months.

#### 1) AI Response (what I can say with the data shown)
**Scope I can see:** The BoA opportunity list and notes you provided. I don’t have direct product health telemetry/TAC summaries in this view. I’ll flag *signals* from the opp notes and mark where confirmation is required. (I’m showing my edges so you can model what I know.) fileciteturn1file0L21-L28

| Opportunity | Product Family (inferred) | Signal of Critical Health (last 90d) | Confidence | Recommended Next Step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **BofA - ION1200s Pilots100** | Prisma SD-WAN (ION1200S) | **Potential**: note mentions removing LTE; could be tied to field advisories or device module issues; needs validation. | Low | Pull last 90d Health Hub + TAC P1/P2 for ION1200S; confirm if any Sev-Critical advisories impacted BoA fleets. |
| **BofA - ION3200 branch upgrades – FY24** | Prisma SD-WAN (ION3200) | None observed in notes; RFP on hold appears business/process, not health. | Medium | Still run 90d health check to de-risk RFP. |
| **BofA - Prisma Access for Mobile** | Prisma Access | No health signal in notes provided. | Medium | Quick check for service incidents impacting BoA tenants; validate POP performance. |
| **BofA - NGFW for GEOS Edge** | Strata NGFW | No signal in notes provided. | Medium | Review device uptime/panOS advisories for GEOS edge models. |
| **BofA - Malware Scanning** | Advanced Threat/ML add-on | No signal in notes provided. | Low | Confirm component SKU and scan advisory history. |
| **BofA - Firewalls for SDWAN Lab** | Strata NGFW (lab) | No signal in notes provided. | Low | Ensure lab images on recommended release train. |
| **BofA - RFP Focus Services – FY24** | Services | N/A (services). | High | — |

*Hook:* Want me to run a targeted health sweep (TAC + advisory + release train) on these four product areas and return a yes/no list with incident IDs? (Keeps momentum even with partial data.) fileciteturn1file0L41-L47

#### 2) User Follow Up (AE)
“Which specific incidents or advisories triggered the ‘Potential’ flag on ION1200S in the last 90 days? Give dates, incident/advisory IDs, customer impact, and recommended mitigations we can offer in our pilot.”

#### 3) Error Handling Scenario (AI)
I don’t have the TAC/advisory corpus in this view, so I can’t confirm incident IDs or dates yet. Here’s how I’ll proceed—short, actionable, and transparent:  
- **What I know:** ION1200S is in scope; your note indicates LTE removal may affect the pilot.  
- **What I don’t know (yet):** Whether BoA was impacted by any Sev-Critical events on ION1200S/LTE modules in the last 90 days; exact advisory IDs/dates. (Showing edges.) fileciteturn1file0L16-L28  
- **Immediate value:** I’ll prepare a **mitigation menu** you can position now (validated image version, dual-WAN path preference, HA on critical branches, fall-forward to ION3200 where LTE is removed). (Always leave with value.) fileciteturn1file0L41-L47  
- **Next step:** With access to Health Hub/TAC, I’ll return a **one-pager** listing: *Incident/Advisory ID → Date → Impact → Affected versions → Mitigations*. Do you want me to track and notify you when those sources are connected? (Invite you into the loop; sustain flow with a single hook.) fileciteturn1file0L80-L86fileciteturn1file1L12-L16

**Self-validation:** Labeled inferences vs facts, delivered a partial but useful triage + next step. If product health isn’t available, the plan still advances the deal.

### Conversational Flow A2

> Prioritize which BoA opportunities are most likely to slip **this calendar Q3 2025** and list the top **MEDDPICC gaps** to close this week.

#### 1) AI Response
**Assumptions:** Using your table’s dates: Aug–Sep 2025 = Q3. Items in Q3: *RFP Focus Services (8/15), Prisma Access for Mobile (9/17), ION1200s Pilots100 (9/19), Malware Scanning (9/19).* I can’t see actual commit history or activity logs here.

**Slip risk (highest → lowest)**  
1) **RFP Focus Services – 8/15 – Stage 3 Best Case – $2.00M**  
   - *Why risk:* Past due; Services often hinge on paper process + SOW detail.  
   - *Gaps (MEDDPICC):* **P, Pp** (paper process/SOW approvals unclear), **EB** unverified, **C** (competition on services benches).  
   - *This week:* Lock **Paper Process** (routing, legal holidays), schedule EB 15-min to validate acceptance criteria; draft SOW milestones.

2) **Prisma Access for Mobile – 9/17 – Stage 3 Best Case – $3.60M**  
   - *Why risk:* Past due; likely **Decision Criteria** not fully validated with EB.  
   - *Gaps:* **DC, EB, M** (metrics tied to remote workforce outcomes).  
   - *This week:* Align on 2–3 measurable outcomes (e.g., auth success %, latency baseline), secure EB validation, confirm rollout phases.

3) **ION1200s Pilots100 – 9/19 – Stage 3 Best Case – $145k**  
   - *Why risk:* Pilot hardware scope shifting (LTE removal).  
   - *Gaps:* **I** (implicated pain documented?), **C** (alt SD-WAN vendors?), **Pp** (pilot exit criteria).  
   - *This week:* Freeze pilot exit criteria; document “success bar” and alternatives if LTE is out.

4) **Malware Scanning – 9/19 – Stage 2 Pipeline – $300k**  
   - *Why risk:* Earlier stage; Lab HLD pending.  
   - *Gaps:* **DC, DP, Ch** (no named champion yet).  
   - *This week:* Identify a **Champion** in GIS; co-author HLD acceptance tests; clarify Decision Process steps.

*Hook:* Want a one-slide **Q3 slip-recovery plan** with owners/dates you can circulate to GIS/CTO?

#### 2) User Follow Up (AE)
“Draft 3 executive-level **EB validation questions** for Prisma Access for Mobile and sketch a **mutual close plan** from now through the 9/25 decision checkpoint.”

#### 3) Error Handling Scenario (AI)
I don’t have executive names/calendars here, so I’ll give you **EB-agnostic** language you can paste today (maintaining flow while acknowledging limits). fileciteturn1file1L8-L16  
- **EB questions (3):**  
  1) “Which *business* metrics (productivity, ticket volume, user latency) must improve in the first 30 days to green-light phase 2?”  
  2) “What’s the *non-negotiable* decision criterion that would stop this deployment?”  
  3) “If we meet the criteria by <date>, who signs the paper and what is the sequence?”  
- **Mutual close plan (milestones):** Today—confirm criteria & sign-offs → T-5d—POC summary & risk log → T-3d—commercials and paper routing → T-1d—go/no-go review → **T** (9/25)—decision & rollout plan.

If you want, I’ll convert this to a shareable **mutual action plan** and ping you when I have stakeholder names to personalize (showing edges; leaving value; inviting you in). fileciteturn1file0L16-L28fileciteturn1file0L41-L47fileciteturn1file0L80-L86

**Self-validation:** Clear risk ranking and MEDDPICC gaps using only provided fields; produced EB questions and a close plan despite missing stakeholder data.

### Conversational Flow A3

> Draft an exec-level email to BoA (CTO + GIS VP) summarizing: (1) SD-WAN branch upgrade path with ION3200, (2) GEOS Edge NGFW migration, (3) our commitment to service health monitoring; request a 20-min alignment before RFP freeze.

#### 1) AI Response (email draft)
Subject: BoA Branch & Edge Security – 20-min Alignment Before RFP Freeze  
Hi <CTO Name> and <GIS VP Name>,  
We propose:  
- **ION3200 branch upgrades** aligned to your FY24 RFP, with pilot-to-scale guardrails and no-regrets config baselines.  
- **GEOS Edge NGFW migration** on a recommended PAN-OS train, mapped to your renewal decision and GEOS timelines.  
- **Service health monitoring** with weekly telemetry reviews and executive-level incident briefings.

Best, <Your Name> | Palo Alto Networks

*Hook:* Want me to version this for COO outcomes (operations resilience, risk, cost) in ≤120 words?

#### 2) User Follow Up (AE)
“Shorten to ≤120 words and reframe for the **COO** (business outcomes first, product second).”

#### 3) Error Handling Scenario (AI)
I don’t have confirmed exec availability or titles here, so I’ll provide a **role-based** short version with placeholders—keeps momentum without over-promising. (Narrate the arc; sustain flow.) fileciteturn1file0L55-L67fileciteturn1file1L8-L16  

Subject: BoA Operations Resilience – Quick Alignment  
Hi <COO Name>,  
We can improve **branch uptime, user experience, and incident time-to-resolve** while de-risking your RFP:  
• Scale-ready **SD-WAN upgrades** (ION3200) with standard configs to lower ops variance.  
• **Edge NGFW migration** mapped to renewal dates to reduce change risk.  
• **Health monitoring** cadence with exec-level summaries so issues never surprise operations.  
Could we reserve **20 minutes** this week to confirm criteria and the paper path? (Tue 10:00 / Wed 2:00 / Thu 11:30 PT)

## You (2025-10-02T21:41:00.864000+00:00)

As a human-centered designer, conduct a detailed critique of the "3) Error Handling Scenario (AI)" in flows A1, A2, and A3, and help outline how the responses do not align with the principles listed in the 'Principles to maintain credibility' document, and propose a more appropriate response that aligns more closely with the attached document.

## ChatGPT (2025-10-02T21:41:01.586829+00:00)

Great prompt. Let’s walk through a **principled, human-centered critique** of the *Error Handling Scenarios* in **Flows A1, A2, and A3**, grounded in the **"Principles to Maintain Credibility"** document you provided.

---

## 🔍 Framework for Critique

Each AI error handling response will be evaluated against the document’s 5 principles:

1. **State the Edges** – Explicitly state what is known vs unknown.
2. **Use the Most Relevant Info Available** – Even partial context should be used to keep value flowing.
3. **Share What Happens Next** – Offer the user a path forward.
4. **Let the User In** – Invite collaboration; don’t gate or hide.
5. **Be Concise, Specific, and Human** – Avoid vagueness, verbosity, or robotic phrasing.

# 🔎 A1 – Critical Health Signal on ION1200S

### ✳️ Original AI Response (Excerpted)
> I don’t have the TAC/advisory corpus in this view, so I can’t confirm incident IDs or dates yet.  
> Here’s how I’ll proceed:  
> – ION1200S is in scope; note indicates LTE removal.  
> – I’ll prepare a mitigation menu...  
> – I’ll return a one-pager... Do you want me to track and notify...?

### ❌ What’s misaligned:
| Principle | Gap |
|----------|-----|
| **1. State the Edges** | ✅ Clearly distinguishes known vs unknown. |
| **2. Use Most Relevant Info** | ❌ “Mitigation menu” is vague—doesn't build on real product behavior or prior BoA context. |
| **3. Share What Happens Next** | ✅ Offers a next step. |
| **4. Let the User In** | ❌ Invitation to “notify” is passive; no co-navigation. |
| **5. Be Concise, Specific, Human** | ⚠️ Slightly verbose; “mitigation menu” lacks specificity; doesn’t feel grounded in AE-speak. |

---

### ✅ Revised, Human-Centered Response

> I don’t have access to TAC/advisory records right now, so I can’t confirm specific incidents for ION1200S.  
> **Here’s what I can do today:**  
> - Based on LTE removal in your pilot note, it’s worth validating if that aligns with any past field advisories or hardware constraints (e.g. [insert known LTE module issue if relevant]).  
> - I’ll flag this for a **health trace**: ION1200S + LTE + BoA region, last 90 days.  
> - Want me to auto-pull and share a 1-pager when advisory access is restored?  
>  
> Meanwhile, here are 2 mitigations you can position now:  
> • Favor dual-WAN fallback over LTE for remote branches.  
> • Request BoA test image aligned with recommended release (PAN-OS X.X.X).  
>  
> I’ll loop back once I can confirm impact with IDs and dates. Want to track this live?

✅ **Better Alignment:** Concrete, specific mitigations; relates clearly to AE task (pilot readiness); invites the user *into the remediation loop*.

# 🔎 A2 – EB Validation Questions for Prisma Access

### ✳️ Original AI Response
> I don’t have executive names/calendars here, so I’ll give you EB-agnostic language...  
> - EB Questions  
> - Close Plan  
> If you want, I’ll convert this to a shareable mutual action plan...

### ❌ What’s misaligned:
| Principle | Gap |
|----------|-----|
| **1. State the Edges** | ✅ States missing EB names. |
| **2. Use Most Relevant Info** | ❌ Doesn’t tailor the EB questions to the BoA or remote access context. |
| **3. Share What Happens Next** | ✅ Offers mutual action plan next step. |
| **4. Let the User In** | ⚠️ Passive: “If you want…” instead of making a co-decision. |
| **5. Be Concise, Specific, Human** | ⚠️ Slightly formulaic; questions aren’t clearly BoA-aligned.

---

### ✅ Revised, Human-Centered Response

> I can’t see executive names or calendars, so I’ll give you **BoA-ready** EB questions you can tailor:  
> **1.** “What SLAs on mobile access matter most to you post-rollout—latency, auth times, or visibility?”  
> **2.** “What outcome would trigger BoA to pause or cancel phase 2?”  
> **3.** “If we meet those targets by 9/17, who signs and how long does paper take?”

# 🔎 A3 – Exec Email for COO Version

### ✳️ Original AI Response
> I don’t have confirmed exec availability or titles here, so I’ll provide a **role-based** short version...

### ❌ What’s misaligned:
| Principle | Gap |
|----------|-----|
| **1. State the Edges** | ✅ Says roles/titles are unknown. |
| **2. Use Most Relevant Info** | ❌ Business outcomes not clearly tied to product implications (e.g., how ION3200 improves ops resilience). |
| **3. Share What Happens Next** | ⚠️ Offers time options, but no fallback or async path. |
| **4. Let the User In** | ❌ No option to co-edit/personalize or adapt to calendar constraints. |
| **5. Be Concise, Specific, Human** | ⚠️ OK on word count, but still somewhat templated in tone.

---

### ✅ Revised, Human-Centered Response

> Subject: Improving BoA Branch Resilience – Quick 20-min Sync  
>  
> Hi <COO Name>,  
> To support your FY24 goals, we’re proposing:  
> - **Standardized SD-WAN branch configs** (ION3200) to reduce change risk and accelerate rollout.  
> - **Edge NGFW upgrades** timed with renewal to boost threat coverage and minimize downtime.  
> - Weekly service health insights so you’re never surprised by an outage.  
>  
> Could we align briefly this week to confirm decision criteria + rollout triggers? If calendar’s tight, I can send a summary deck instead.

✅ **Better Alignment:** Grounded in outcomes, gives fallback option (deck), and ties each product move to a COO pain point.

# 🧭 Summary Table: Alignment Scorecard

| Flow | Error Handling Quality | Misalignment Theme | Suggested Fix |
|------|------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| A1 – Critical Health | ⚠️ Medium | Vague mitigations, no hard evidence | Anchor mitigations in known field issues; pre-commit to follow-up |
| A2 – EB Questions | ⚠️ Medium | Questions too generic; passive invitation | Make questions specific to scenario; co-author plan |
| A3 – Exec Email | ⚠️ Medium | Product-outcome link weak; no async option | Rewrite with clearer outcomes and fallback options |

---

## ✅ Recommendations for Improving All AI Error Handling:
1. **Make partial answers feel immediately useful** – don’t wait for perfect context.
2. **Pull in real-world examples or defaults** – e.g., known advisories, standard rollout plans.
3. **Always frame next steps as *co-owned* paths**, not handoffs or vague “notifications.”
4. **Favor role-and-situation-specific language** over templates.
5. **Use credible placeholders with context**, not boilerplate "I don't have access."

Would you like these critiques turned into a **design pattern deck for AI error handling** in sales tools—complete with before/after examples and prompts?

## You (2025-10-02T21:45:03.649000+00:00)

Conduct a detailed critique of the first iteration of "3) Error Handling Scenario (AI)" in flows A1, A2, and A3, and help outline how the responses do not align with the principles listed in the 'Principles to maintain credibility' document, and propose a more appropriate response that aligns more closely with the attached document. 

---

For your reference, I need a critique of these:
"3) Error Handling Scenario (AI)

I don’t have the TAC/advisory corpus in this view, so I can’t confirm incident IDs or dates yet. Here’s how I’ll proceed—short, actionable, and transparent:

What I know: ION1200S is in scope; your note indicates LTE removal may affect the pilot.

What I don’t know (yet): Whether BoA was impacted by any Sev-Critical events on ION1200S/LTE modules in the last 90 days; exact advisory IDs/dates. (Showing edges.)

Immediate value: I’ll prepare a mitigation menu you can position now (validated image version, dual-WAN path preference, HA on critical branches, fall-forward to ION3200 where LTE is removed). (Always leave with value.)

Next step: With access to Health Hub/TAC, I’ll return a one-pager listing: Incident/Advisory ID → Date → Impact → Affected versions → Mitigations. Do you want me to track and notify you when those sources are connected? (Invite you into the loop; sustain flow with a single hook.)"

"3) Error Handling Scenario (AI)

I don’t have executive names/calendars here, so I’ll give you EB-agnostic language you can paste today (maintaining flow while acknowledging limits).

EB questions (3):

“Which business metrics (productivity, ticket volume, user latency) must improve in the first 30 days to green-light phase 2?”

“What’s the non-negotiable decision criterion that would stop this deployment?”

“If we meet the criteria by <date>, who signs the paper and what is the sequence?”

Mutual close plan (milestones): Today—confirm criteria & sign-offs → T-5d—POC summary & risk log → T-3d—commercials and paper routing → T-1d—go/no-go review → T (9/25)—decision & rollout plan."

"3) Error Handling Scenario (AI)

I don’t have confirmed exec availability or titles here, so I’ll provide a role-based short version with placeholders—keeps momentum without over-promising. (Narrate the arc; sustain flow.)

Subject: BoA Operations Resilience – Quick Alignment
Hi <COO Name>,
We can improve branch uptime, user experience, and incident time-to-resolve while de-risking your RFP:
• Scale-ready SD-WAN upgrades (ION3200) with standard configs to lower ops variance.
• Edge NGFW migration mapped to renewal dates to reduce change risk.
• Health monitoring cadence with exec-level summaries so issues never surprise operations.
Could we reserve 20 minutes this week to confirm criteria and the paper path? (Tue 10:00 / Wed 2:00 / Thu 11:30 PT)
—<Your Name>

If you share names and availability, I’ll personalize and insert calendar holds. (Invite you into the loop.)"

## ChatGPT (2025-10-02T21:45:04.495983+00:00)

Here’s a **detailed critique** of the three *first iteration* Error Handling Scenarios from A1, A2, and A3—each evaluated against the **"Principles to Maintain Credibility"** framework. For each, I’ll expose specific credibility gaps, explain *why they matter*, and offer a revised version that more closely aligns with the document’s standards.

---

## 🔎 FLOW A1 – Product Health Advisory Unknown (ION1200S)

### ✳️ Original Error Handling Response:

> I don’t have the TAC/advisory corpus...  
> **What I know:** ION1200S in scope... LTE removal may affect pilot  
> **What I don’t know (yet):** BoA impact from Sev-Critical events  
> **Immediate value:** I’ll prepare a mitigation menu...  
> **Next step:** Return a one-pager w/ advisory IDs. Do you want me to track and notify?

---

### ❌ Critique Against Credibility Principles:

| Principle | Evaluation | Issue |
|----------|------------|-------|
| 1. **State the Edges** | ✅ Edge declared: TAC not visible | Clear, though passive in tone. |
| 2. **Use Relevant Info** | ❌ “Mitigation menu” is vague; no tie to specific known issues | Should cite likely advisory or known LTE-related field issues. |
| 3. **Share What Happens Next** | ⚠️ Promises a one-pager but lacks time frame or trigger | Could imply uncertainty or delay. |
| 4. **Let the User In** | ❌ Invitation is too soft: “Do you want me to…” | Fails to model co-ownership of the data issue. |
| 5. **Be Concise, Specific, Human** | ⚠️ Robotic phrasing like “track and notify” weakens trust | Needs more conversational clarity and AE-centric voice. |

---

### ✅ Revised Error Handling Response (Aligned to Principles):

> I can’t access TAC advisories right now, so I can’t name specific ION1200S incidents affecting BoA.  
>  
> But here’s what we can act on **today**:  
> - LTE removal may point to prior ION1200S field issues (e.g., thermal throttling or cellular instability seen in [insert known issue if plausible]).  
> - Recommend **dual-WAN pathing**, confirm **firmware version X.Y.Z**, and prep for **ION3200 substitution** on key branches.  
>  
> I’ll set a trigger to auto-pull the last 90d of Health Hub data on ION1200S once access is live. Want a shared workspace to co-track impact and mitigations?

✅ *Key Gains:* Specific actions, partial diagnosis, co-navigation, and clear user invitation.

---

## 🔎 FLOW A2 – Missing EB Names, Needing Questions & Plan

### ✳️ Original Error Handling Response:

> I don’t have executive names...  
> EB questions (generic), mutual close plan (steps)...  
> “If you want, I’ll convert this to a shareable plan...”

---

### ❌ Critique Against Credibility Principles:

| Principle | Evaluation | Issue |
|----------|------------|-------|
| 1. **State the Edges** | ✅ Names missing is stated | Adequate. |
| 2. **Use Relevant Info** | ⚠️ Questions not tailored to BoA or Prisma Access context | Generic; misses remote work or latency metrics. |
| 3. **Share What Happens Next** | ⚠️ Offers mutual action plan, but doesn’t lead | Lacks assertiveness and ownership. |
| 4. **Let the User In** | ❌ Passive: “If you want…” instead of modeling co-authorship | Doesn’t invite active shaping. |
| 5. **Be Concise, Specific, Human** | ⚠️ Robotic transitions, formulaic questions | Needs voice and contextual relevance.

---

### ✅ Revised Error Handling Response (Aligned to Principles):

> I don’t have executive names on file, but I’ll draft **BoA-specific EB questions** based on your mobile access pilot:  
>  
> • “What baseline metrics—auth time, session uptime—must improve in the first 30 days?”  
> • “What’s the kill-switch: what failure would halt rollout?”  
> • “If we hit these targets by 9/17, who signs off and how fast is the paper path?”  
>  
> I’ll turn this into a **live mutual action plan** you can shape. Want me to drop it into a workspace with BoA’s key phases pre-filled?

✅ *Key Gains:* Contextual relevance, action-oriented tone, and co-authorship posture.

---

## 🔎 FLOW A3 – Missing Exec Details for Outreach Email

### ✳️ Original Error Handling Response:

> I don’t have confirmed exec availability or titles...  
> Subject: BoA Operations Resilience – Quick Alignment  
> <Role-based email body with placeholder>  
> “If you share names and availability, I’ll personalize...”

---

### ❌ Critique Against Credibility Principles:

| Principle | Evaluation | Issue |
|----------|------------|-------|
| 1. **State the Edges** | ✅ Titles missing, stated clearly | Solid. |
| 2. **Use Relevant Info** | ❌ Business outcomes not linked to specific product benefit | Needs outcome/product tie: e.g., ops uptime ↔ SD-WAN configs. |
| 3. **Share What Happens Next** | ⚠️ Suggests time slots, but no fallback | No async or alternate path if live time fails. |
| 4. **Let the User In** | ❌ No workspace, no option to iterate or co-draft | Passive delivery. |
| 5. **Be Concise, Specific, Human** | ⚠️ Jargon-heavy (e.g., “reduce change risk,” “health monitoring cadence”) | Needs more executive voice.

---

### ✅ Revised Error Handling Response (Aligned to Principles):

> I don’t yet have BoA exec names or calendars, but here’s a **COO-ready draft** focused on ops outcomes:  
>  
> —  
> Subject: Improving BoA Branch Resilience – 20-min Sync

## 🧭 Summary of Key Improvements

| Flow | Major Fix | Credibility Gains |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| A1 | Specific mitigations, co-owned next step | Trust from product insight + collaboration |
| A2 | Contextual questions, assertive planning | Shows AE-like thinking; aligns with customer logic |
| A3 | Outcome-first email, async path, co-drafting offer | Matches executive cadence and scheduling reality |

Would you like these critiques and revisions bundled into a **Credibility Violations Playbook for Conversational AI**, so your team can test future scenarios against it?

## You (2025-10-02T21:53:54.818000+00:00)

The responses are still not aligned with the principles. If you notice the tone, every error handling response starts with 'I don't', or 'I can't'. 

This makes it challenging to build trust. Once you repeatedly tell a user that you are incapable of something, you slowly lose their trust. 

Here's an example from the principles:

---
### Example

> Prompt: “How are Q2 budgets looking for Team B?”
> 
> 
> **System:** *“I can see finalized budgets in Workday, not real-time expenses. Based on that, Team B is at 72% utilization. Want me to alert you when live expense data lands?”*
>
---
Here is an example of Principle 3 from the document.
---
Example Application:

“Slack conversations aren’t included yet, but that’s one of the next data sources I’m learning. For now, here’s what I can infer from Jira + Salesforce.”
---

Using this, rework the responses.

## ChatGPT (2025-10-02T21:53:55.891076+00:00)

Thank you for the sharp and entirely valid correction. You're right—*every initial phrase of incapability chips away at perceived trust and momentum*. By leading with absence, the system frames itself as a **barrier**, not an enabler. According to the credibility principles, especially **Principles 2 and 3**, the response should begin with what *is available*, then naturally reveal the gap *only as context* for how we move forward.

Let’s now rework the three “Error Handling” scenarios with this reoriented stance—*building from available insight and turning absence into opportunity*.

> Want me to deliver a quick incident timeline with IDs and mitigation paths once that data syncs?

✔ **Credibility Wins**:
- Begins with *what the AI can see and deduce*
- Implicitly builds trust in system capability
- Provides interim value before the system re-syncs

## 🧭 Final Note: Tone, Momentum, Ownership

Across all three flows, the new responses:
- Avoid “I don’t…” or “I can’t…” as openers  
- Center what *is* visible, inferable, or actionable  
- Integrate limitations naturally into *forward progress*  
- Invite the AE into shared authorship and timing

Would you like these rewritten responses distilled into a **“Do/Don’t Error Handling Promptbook”** or reusable **response template set** for your team?

## You (2025-10-02T22:06:13.809000+00:00)

Rewrite the 3 scenarios: A1, A2, A3 from your very first response in this thread. Make 1 exception: Replace the contents for each of the error handling scenarios the the most recent responses for the error handling. 

For example,

### Conversational Flow A1

> Find me opportunities where the products involved have had a critical health for the last 3 months.

#### 1) AI Response
**Scope I can see:** The BoA opportunity list and notes you provided. I don’t have direct product health telemetry/TAC summaries in this view. I’ll flag *signals* from the opp notes and mark where confirmation is required.

| Opportunity | Product Family (inferred) | Signal of Critical Health (last 90d) | Confidence | Recommended Next Step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **BofA - ION1200s Pilots100** | Prisma SD-WAN (ION1200S) | **Potential**: note mentions removing LTE; could be tied to field advisories or device module issues; needs validation. | Low | Pull last 90d Health Hub + TAC P1/P2 for ION1200S; confirm if any Sev-Critical advisories impacted BoA fleets. |
| **BofA - ION3200 branch upgrades – FY24** | Prisma SD-WAN (ION3200) | None observed in notes; RFP on hold appears business/process, not health. | Medium | Still run 90d health check to de-risk RFP. |
| **BofA - Prisma Access for Mobile** | Prisma Access | No health signal in notes provided. | Medium | Quick check for service incidents impacting BoA tenants; validate POP performance. |
| **BofA - NGFW for GEOS Edge** | Strata NGFW | No signal in notes provided. | Medium | Review device uptime/panOS advisories for GEOS edge models. |
| **BofA - Malware Scanning** | Advanced Threat/ML add-on | No signal in notes provided. | Low | Confirm component SKU and scan advisory history. |
| **BofA - Firewalls for SDWAN Lab** | Strata NGFW (lab) | No signal in notes provided. | Low | Ensure lab images on recommended release train. |
| **BofA - RFP Focus Services – FY24** | Services | N/A (services). | High | — |

*Hook:* Want me to run a targeted health sweep (TAC + advisory + release train) on these four product areas and return a yes/no list with incident IDs?

#### 2) User Follow Up (AE)
“Which specific incidents or advisories triggered the ‘Potential’ flag on ION1200S in the last 90 days? Give dates, incident/advisory IDs, customer impact, and recommended mitigations we can offer in our pilot.”

#### 3) Error Handling Scenario (AI) — **Reworked**
I can see that BoA’s pilot for the ION1200S involves LTE removal—often a signal of reliability or cost concerns tied to cellular modules. Based on recent field patterns, that could intersect with known LTE-related advisories.

While TAC incident data isn’t surfaced in this view yet, I’ve queued a lookup for recent Sev-Criticals tied to ION1200S LTE across large branch deployments.

Meanwhile, here are two mitigations you can position proactively:  
• Confirm dual-WAN fallback is enabled on test branches  
• Validate image is on PAN-OS X.X.X (release aligned to LTE bugfixes)

Want me to deliver a quick incident timeline with IDs and mitigation paths once that data syncs?

**Self-validation:** Clear value first, limitation embedded as context, concrete mitigations, and a crisp next step that keeps momentum.

### Conversational Flow A2

> Prioritize which BoA opportunities are most likely to slip **this calendar Q3 2025** and list the top **MEDDPICC gaps** to close this week.

#### 1) AI Response
**Assumptions:** Using your table’s dates: Aug–Sep 2025 = Q3. Items in Q3: *RFP Focus Services (8/15), Prisma Access for Mobile (9/17), ION1200s Pilots100 (9/19), Malware Scanning (9/19).* I can’t see actual commit history or activity logs here.

**Slip risk (highest → lowest)**  
1) **RFP Focus Services – 8/15 – Stage 3 Best Case – $2.00M**  
   - *Why risk:* Past due; Services often hinge on paper process + SOW detail.  
   - *Gaps (MEDDPICC):* **P, Pp** (paper process/SOW approvals unclear), **EB** unverified, **C** (competition on services benches).  
   - *This week:* Lock **Paper Process** (routing, legal holidays), schedule EB 15-min to validate acceptance criteria; draft SOW milestones.

2) **Prisma Access for Mobile – 9/17 – Stage 3 Best Case – $3.60M**  
   - *Why risk:* Past due; likely **Decision Criteria** not fully validated with EB.  
   - *Gaps:* **DC, EB, M** (metrics tied to remote workforce outcomes).  
   - *This week:* Align on 2–3 measurable outcomes (e.g., auth success %, latency baseline), secure EB validation, confirm rollout phases.

3) **ION1200s Pilots100 – 9/19 – Stage 3 Best Case – $145k**  
   - *Why risk:* Pilot hardware scope shifting (LTE removal).  
   - *Gaps:* **I** (implicated pain documented?), **C** (alt SD-WAN vendors?), **Pp** (pilot exit criteria).  
   - *This week:* Freeze pilot exit criteria; document “success bar” and alternatives if LTE is out.

4) **Malware Scanning – 9/19 – Stage 2 Pipeline – $300k**  
   - *Why risk:* Earlier stage; Lab HLD pending.  
   - *Gaps:* **DC, DP, Ch** (no named champion yet).  
   - *This week:* Identify a **Champion** in GIS; co-author HLD acceptance tests; clarify Decision Process steps.

*Hook:* Want a one-slide **Q3 slip-recovery plan** with owners/dates you can circulate to GIS/CTO?

#### 2) User Follow Up (AE)
“Draft 3 executive-level **EB validation questions** for Prisma Access for Mobile and sketch a **mutual close plan** from now through the 9/25 decision checkpoint.”

#### 3) Error Handling Scenario (AI) — **Reworked**
For BoA’s Prisma Access rollout, here’s how you might test EB alignment without knowing their titles yet:

• “What metrics—auth latency, mobile session stability—must we hit in the first 30 days to unlock rollout?”  
• “What issue would force a pause before phase 2 begins?”  
• “Assuming we hit targets by 9/17, who owns sign-off and how fast is the paper path?”

Based on these, I’ve started framing a close plan keyed to your 9/25 checkpoint. Want to co-author a working draft to circulate internally?

**Self-validation:** Leads with immediately usable content, tailors to Prisma Access, and proposes a co-owned next step.

Hi <COO Name>,  
To support branch reliability and reduce rollout risk:  
• SD-WAN upgrade path (ION3200) reduces change variance  
• Edge NGFW migration aligns with renewal and lowers ops risk  
• Weekly health summaries ensure no surprises post-deploy  

I’ve held open slots Tue 10:00 / Wed 2:00 / Thu 11:30 PT for a quick alignment. Prefer async? I can send a 1-page exec brief instead.

now help me understand all the content as someone who does not understand Palo Alto Networks or their products

## ChatGPT (2025-10-02T22:17:03.580758+00:00)

Perfect — let’s take a step back and reframe **all the content in A1, A2, and A3** so that even someone with **no prior knowledge of Palo Alto Networks (PANW)** or cybersecurity products can follow along. I’ll explain it in **plain English** with real-world analogies.

# 🌐 Quick Primer: Who is Palo Alto Networks?
Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a **cybersecurity company**. Think of them as a “digital security guard” for businesses. They make products that:
- Protect **offices and branch locations** (like firewalls and networking gear)  
- Protect **employees working remotely** (like cloud security and VPN replacements)  
- Protect **apps running in the cloud** (like AWS or Azure)  
- Detect and respond to **attacks quickly** (using AI-driven tools)  

They sell to large enterprises like **Bank of America (BoA)**, which has hundreds (maybe thousands) of offices, branches, and online services to protect.

# 🔎 Flow A1 – Health Signals for Products

**What’s happening:**  
BoA is testing a product called **ION1200S**, which is a piece of hardware that helps branch offices connect securely to the bank’s main systems (think of it like a smart internet router for branches).  

They’re planning to remove **LTE (cellular connection)** as a backup for these devices. That’s unusual because LTE is often used as a “last resort” if the main internet goes down. Removing it might signal **cost concerns** or **technical problems with LTE on these devices**.  

**AI’s role:**  
The system looks at deal notes and says:  
- “This product might have had recent issues (advisories, outages, or bugs).”  
- It can’t list the actual incident IDs yet (like case numbers in a hospital system), but it suggests immediate mitigations:  
  - Use **two internet connections** instead of LTE for backup.  
  - Check that the device is running on the latest **safe software version**.  

**Plain takeaway:**  
> The system is helping the sales rep spot a **potential technical risk** in the bank’s pilot project and suggesting **quick fixes** while waiting for more detailed incident reports.

# 🔎 Flow A2 – Deal Risk & Executive Questions

**What’s happening:**  
BoA has several ongoing projects with Palo Alto Networks (firewalls, cloud security, etc.). Some are at risk of **slipping past deadlines** this quarter. The rep asks: “Which ones are most likely to slip and what should I fix right now?”  

**AI’s role:**  
The system ranks the projects most at risk. For example:  
- A **services contract** is late because paperwork hasn’t been signed.  
- A **remote access project (Prisma Access)** needs executives to agree on **what success looks like** (e.g., “employees must be able to log in 99% of the time without delay”).  
- A **hardware pilot (ION1200S again)** is shaky because requirements keep changing.  

The rep then asks: “What questions should I ask executives to make sure this project stays on track?”  

The AI suggests:  
- “Which metrics matter most for success—speed, reliability, or security?”  
- “What would make you hit the stop button on this rollout?”  
- “If we meet the success targets, who signs off and how long does the approval take?”  

**Plain takeaway:**  
> The AI is coaching the sales rep to ask **business leaders the right questions** so deals don’t get delayed by vague goals, unclear approvals, or missing sign-offs.

# 🔎 Flow A3 – Drafting Executive Emails

**What’s happening:**  
The rep needs to email **BoA executives** to secure a short meeting. They want to summarize three key things:  
1. Branch office upgrades (better, more reliable internet/security gear).  
2. Edge firewalls (devices that stop hackers from breaking in at branch locations).  
3. Ongoing service monitoring (regular updates so execs know security is running smoothly).  

**AI’s role:**  
The system drafts a **professional, short email** that:  
- Frames the benefits in **business terms** (uptime, resilience, no surprises).  
- Suggests specific meeting times.  
- Offers a fallback: “If you can’t meet, I’ll send a one-page summary.”  

**Plain takeaway:**  
> The AI is helping the sales rep **communicate clearly with executives**—focusing on outcomes like reliability and reduced risk, instead of technical jargon.

# 🎯 Putting It All Together

Across A1, A2, and A3, here’s what’s happening:  

1. **A1 (Product Health)** – The AI helps the rep spot potential **technical risks** in ongoing projects, even without full data, and offers **quick fixes**.  
2. **A2 (Deal Risk)** – The AI highlights which deals are most likely to miss deadlines and gives the rep **smart executive questions** to keep things moving.  
3. **A3 (Executive Email)** – The AI drafts **concise, outcome-focused emails** so reps can confidently engage with top decision-makers.  

---

👉 If you’re **new to Palo Alto Networks**: Think of these flows as **sales enablement tools** where AI is acting like an **assistant coach**—helping a salesperson anticipate risks, frame better questions, and communicate value in a way that resonates with customers.

Would it help if I now **reframed each flow using a non-tech analogy** (e.g., comparing PANW products to “home security systems” or “car safety features”) so it’s even easier to grasp?

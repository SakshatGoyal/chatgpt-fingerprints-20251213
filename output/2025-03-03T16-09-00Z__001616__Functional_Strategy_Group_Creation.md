# Functional Strategy Group Creation



## You (2025-03-03T16:09:00.569000+00:00)

I need you to help me create some people groups or people databases within apollo.io. I think you'll find six categories of strategy within the document I attached so for each category I need at least one or two groups so our objective is to recruit high-level individuals for a user research interview and so the details of the kind of people we are looking for can be found within the documents so there's in the document for each category. You'll find a very comprehensive table. Something you may not find in the table itself is that I need the source of a 5 x 5 approach well for each category you can pick the five most relevant industries all departments and for each of the departments/ industries, we need approximately five people along a vertical hierarchy so for example, let's say we're talking about product management so we'll talk about VP of product. We talk about chief product officer and then we'll talk about like the VP levels, senior director levels and the directors example is purely based on the product design approach, but as you will see within the documents, there are a wide range of industries and a lot of the job titles I have outlined may not apply to those industries so what I need from you is go through the document. Follow the instructions I've given you and by the end for each category, I need one or two groups and give me like an appropriate name for those groups and for each of those groups. I need the appropriate filters within apollo.io so some of the filters include things like job titles location, number of employees, industry, keywords, and things like that so why don't we do this? Just start with one one group of people but I need you to do this a little thoughtfully so you can start with the functional or tactical strategy group give me potential job titles number of employees industry keywords is also a filter a location so I want you to keep in mind that while I can enter a location like United States will probably have to narrow down a search a little more like United States is pretty broad and a target audience is ideally like people who are at least somewhat well-versed with artificial intelligence so like picking a random down within Texas will not be very helpful for us. We will probably need like the major hubs like San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, but in addition to that we need a few relatively smaller cities like Portland Denver Chicago in those kinds of cities so give it an initial crack and let's see where we can take it from there.

### Filters in Apollo (final summary):

| Field           | Selection Criteria                                                              |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Industry        | Technology & SaaS, Automotive & Electric Vehicles, Pharmaceuticals & Biotech, Retail & E-Commerce, Cybersecurity & IT Security |
| Job Titles      | As listed above, targeting VPs, Directors, and Functional Heads                 |
| Employee Size   | Enterprise (1000+ employees)                                                    |
| Keywords        | AI, ML, Data Science, Automation, Cloud Infrastructure, Digital Transformation, Autonomous Vehicles, Biotech Innovation, SaaS, Cybersecurity |
| Location        | San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Austin, Boston, Denver, Chicago, Portland |

This structured approach gives you a robust starting point. Once you're comfortable, we can replicate and fine-tune this approach for additional strategy categories or groups.

## You (2025-03-03T16:15:33.534000+00:00)

OK, so I'll go through your entire response and I'll give you some feedback based on the titles so the start of the group name I think the group name is a little more generic so I need something. That's a little tight back to the document I have attached and let's see if we can have a structured way of an annotating because we may end up creating like six or seven different groups when it comes to industries I need to understand why you pick those industries like why are these five industries the most relevant given the context within the document and our overall objective so I mean I don't mind the list you have given me, but I need to understand why it was created secondly, when we talk about job markets job titles if you talk about job title help me understand this I can try this approach, but I'm also thinking that a lot of these titles can be different in different companies like if we just take designer so some companies have UX designers other companies are product designers even though their job is roughly the same so I want to make sure that these job titles don't eliminate potentially good Candidates and then company size so at the moment is that our ideal target audience will be people in midsize companies now if you say that, thousand plus is a relatively decent size for midsize companies within the United States then I'll go with that India talking about the keywords you have given me I don't really see these keywords as a filter within apollo.io, and if we talk about location, I don't want to limit the locations you give me based on my instructions like San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles yes, these are major cities, but are these the only major cities like I would argue that Washington DC is also a major city and one could make an argument that even Seattle can count as a major city today I mean, the the latter is not really important because as long as we include that with the filters, we are OK with it, but even though emerging cities, I see that you emerging tech cities, and I'm working with the assumption that you're only targeting tech industries, which is not the case in our project like we can we can be designing for non-tech industries as well so one could make an argument that tech is involved in every industry, but just as a very hypothetical example like we can also consider agricultural and supply chain. Industries are like non-tech industries that we are also targeting, for example, venture capitalism it's not necessarily tech, but yeah, one could understand i they are they are connected with tech. So understand the feedback I have given you and just we think or restructure your entire response.

Below is a restructured group proposal for the Functional & Tactical Strategy category. I’ve tightened the group name and annotated each filter with the rationale behind the choices, ensuring we capture a broad yet strategically relevant sample of candidates.

---

### Group Name:
**Departmental Strategy Pioneers – Cross-Industry Functional Leaders**

*Rationale:*
The name reflects the document’s focus on departmental (functional/tactical) execution while emphasizing leadership and innovation across multiple industries. “Pioneers” signals that these are high-caliber, strategic individuals driving execution in their domains.

---

### Filter Breakdown and Rationale

#### 1. **Industries**
Using the 5x5 framework from the document, these five industries were chosen for their functional complexity and strategic operational challenges:

- **Technology & SaaS:**
  *Why?* High reliance on functional strategies (marketing, product development, R&D) combined with rapid digital transformation. Technology is a common denominator across industries, ensuring a strong pool of leaders.

- **Automotive & Electric Vehicles:**
  *Why?* These companies balance manufacturing excellence with innovation (e.g., autonomous driving, digital marketing) and require robust departmental strategies to manage supply chain, quality, and design.

- **Pharmaceuticals & Biotech:**
  *Why?* Highly regulated with complex R&D, manufacturing, and supply chain operations. Functional leaders here manage strategic execution in dynamic and critical environments.

- **Retail & E-Commerce:**
  *Why?* Retailers integrate marketing, logistics, and digital operations. They require cross-functional expertise to navigate omni-channel strategies and customer experience challenges.

- **Manufacturing & Industrial Goods:**
  *Why?* These industries demand strong operations and supply chain leadership, with a focus on quality, automation, and cost efficiency that makes functional strategy critical.

*Note:* While tech plays a central role, the selection is designed to encompass both tech-driven and traditional industries where functional execution is essential. This balance supports our overall objective to capture diverse, high-level operational leaders.

---

#### 2. **Job Titles (Vertical Hierarchy & Variations)**
To capture a spectrum of seniority within departments, we propose a hierarchy such as:

- **VP / Senior Vice President Level:**
  Example titles: VP of Marketing, VP of Operations, VP of R&D
- **Director Level:**
  Example titles: Marketing Director, Operations Director, Director of Product Innovation
- **Department/Functional Head Level:**
  Example titles: Head of Digital Strategy, Head of Supply Chain, Functional Lead

*Rationale & Flexibility:*
We recognize that job titles vary across companies. For instance, what one organization calls a “UX Designer” might be a “Product Designer” elsewhere. In Apollo, you can use a combination of exact titles and related keywords or synonyms to ensure you don’t miss relevant candidates. Using Boolean searches or including alternative title variations (e.g., “Marketing Director” OR “Director of Marketing”) will help broaden the search while maintaining focus.

---

#### 3. **Company Size**
- **Target:** Companies with 1000+ employees
*Rationale:*
Within the United States, using a 1000+ employee filter generally captures midsize to large enterprises where strategic, departmental roles are well-established. This size benchmark helps ensure that the candidates are operating within sufficiently complex organizational structures.

---

#### 4. **Keywords / Additional Filters**
- **Keywords:** Although Apollo’s filter options for keywords may be limited, consider including terms such as:
  - “Functional Strategy”
  - “Departmental Execution”
  - “Operational Excellence”
  - “Digital Transformation”

*Rationale:*
These keywords can further refine searches in Apollo (or in follow-up manual review) by highlighting candidates who explicitly reference these functions in their profiles, ensuring that our outreach targets individuals actively involved in strategic operational roles.

---

#### 5. **Location**
- **Primary Major Cities:** San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Seattle
- **Additional Emerging/Secondary Cities:** Austin, Boston, Denver, Chicago, Portland

*Rationale:*
While major hubs like San Francisco and New York are vital, including additional cities (such as Washington DC for political and policy insights, as well as emerging tech centers like Austin and Denver) broadens the candidate pool. This ensures that we capture high-level functional leaders regardless of whether their organizations are in traditionally recognized tech centers or other influential markets.

---

### Final Filter Summary (Example Table)

| **Field**          | **Criteria**                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Industry**       | Technology & SaaS, Automotive & Electric Vehicles, Pharmaceuticals & Biotech, Retail & E-Commerce, Manufacturing & Industrial Goods                          |
| **Job Titles**     | VP/SVP (e.g., VP of Marketing, VP of Operations), Director (e.g., Director of Product Innovation), Functional Heads (e.g., Head of Supply Chain) – include synonyms using Boolean operators |
| **Company Size**   | 1000+ employees (to capture midsize and larger organizations)                                                                                                  |
| **Keywords**       | “Functional Strategy”, “Departmental Execution”, “Operational Excellence”, “Digital Transformation” (if applicable within Apollo’s filter options)           |
| **Location**       | Major: San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Seattle; Additional: Austin, Boston, Denver, Chicago, Portland                                           |

## You (2025-03-03T16:24:05.670000+00:00)

OK, well left with a list of 74,000 emails. No I know it's a big ask but ideally I don't want it to be more than 250 so can you help me with a few more filters that can sort of narrow down our search? Ideally these filters should be within apollo.io and if you want, I'll sort of attach a quick snapshot of the filter.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-03T16:24:07.515868+00:00)

Below are some **practical filtering ideas** you can apply in Apollo.io to drastically narrow your 74k results down to a few hundred. You certainly don’t have to use all of them; pick and choose the ones that make the most sense for your specific goals. I’ve grouped them into **five** general strategies for reducing volume:

---

## 1. Title & Function–Based Filters

### **A. “Title must contain” keywords**
Because you’re interested in people who deal directly with strategy, consider adding a filter like:

> **Title must contain at least one of**:
> - Strategy
> - Strategic
> - Innovation
> - Transformation
> - R&D
> - AI / Artificial Intelligence
> - Machine Learning
> - Digital
> - Data
> - Chief (as in C-level)
> - VP
> - Director
> - Head
> - Operations (if you’re focusing on functional/tactical leaders)

This single filter can remove thousands of people who have more tactical or unrelated job titles (e.g., “Account Executive,” “Sales Representative,” etc.). You can add synonyms as well (e.g., “VP,” “Vice President,” “Head,” “Global Head,” “Senior Director,” etc.).

### **B. Exclude certain titles**
To remove large swaths of irrelevant or lower-level contacts, use an **“Exclude”** filter (if Apollo supports it) or a **negative keyword** approach:

> **Exclude job titles containing**:
> - Consultant
> - Recruiter / Recruiting
> - Sales / SDR / BDR / Business Development
> - Marketing Specialist
> - Analyst
> - Coordinator
> - Assistant
> - Intern / Trainee
> - Associate (this often indicates mid-junior in big firms)
> - Owner / Founder / Partner (if you don’t want small-business folks)
> - Advisor / Board Member (not as operationally hands-on)

Just removing “Consultant,” “Analyst,” “Specialist,” and “Coordinator” can knock out tens of thousands of contacts.

### **C. Department / Function filters**
If Apollo supports departmental filtering, you can specify:
- **Include**: Strategy, Operations, R&D, Product, Engineering, IT, Finance, Marketing (if relevant), HR (if relevant)
- **Exclude**: Sales, Business Development, Recruiting, Consulting, Customer Service, etc.

Even if you’re open to multiple functions, simply **excluding** Sales/Business Development and Consulting can remove a large chunk of your 74k results.

---

## 2. Industry & Sub-Industry Tweaks

1. **Focus on fewer industries**
   - If you currently have 5–6 industries selected, try narrowing to just 2–3 that are most critical.
   - For instance, if “Information Technology & Services,” “Internet,” and “Industrial Automation” are your core, you might remove “Telecommunications” or “Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing” to shrink the list.

2. **Use sub-industry or NAICS filtering** (if Apollo supports it)
   - Some platforms let you choose sub-categories (e.g., “AI & Machine Learning” under “Computer Software”) or specific NAICS codes. This helps remove broad segments like “IT Services” that can include thousands of companies.

3. **Exclude entire categories** you know you don’t want (e.g., “Non-profit,” “Government,” “Education Management,” “Hospital & Health Care,” etc.). This can significantly reduce your total.

---

## 3. Company Attributes

### **A. Company Size**
You already have 1001–5000, 5001–10,000, and 10,001+. If 74k is still too big, consider dropping the largest tier (10,001+) or focusing on a narrower revenue band:

- For example, **Revenue** between \$50M and \$1B.
  - Very large enterprises (e.g., Fortune 100) have huge headcounts that can balloon your search.

### **B. Funding Stage**
If Apollo has data on funding stages (Seed, Series A/B, etc.), you can target only those in mid-to-late stage or public companies, depending on your needs. Excluding pre-seed or Series A startups can drop your count dramatically.

### **C. Technologies Used**
If your study requires folks with AI or advanced tech exposure, you can filter by **“Technologies used”** (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, or specific AI/ML tools). This is a quick way to exclude older or less tech-driven companies.

---

## 4. Intent & Activity Filters

1. **Apollo Buyer Intent**: If you only want companies actively researching AI or digital transformation, you can apply an “Intent” filter (if available).
2. **Exclude inactive or unverified**: You’re already using “Verified email.” Some platforms also let you filter by “last active on LinkedIn” or “posted in the last 90 days.”

---

## 5. Geographic Precision

- **Limit the number of metro areas**. Right now, you might have 8–10 cities in your list. If you only keep, say, 3–5, that alone will slash the total.
- Alternatively, keep more cities but apply narrower title filters, or vice versa.

---

# Putting It All Together (Example)

Below is a **hypothetical example** of how you might combine these ideas to get from 74k closer to ~250. Adapt as needed:

1. **Job Titles**:
   - **Must contain** any of: “Strategy,” “Strategic,” “Innovation,” “Transformation,” “AI,” “R&D,” “Digital,” “Data,” “Chief,” “VP,” “Director,” “Head.”
   - **Exclude** any of: “Consultant,” “Recruiter,” “Sales,” “Analyst,” “Coordinator,” “Assistant,” “Intern,” “Owner,” “Founder,” “Partner,” “Advisor,” “Board.”

2. **Company Size or Revenue**:
   - 1001–5000 employees **only** (removing 5001+).
   - Or **Revenue**: \$50M–\$1B if that’s an option.

3. **Industry**:
   - Keep “Information Technology & Services,” “Internet,” “Industrial Automation,” and **remove** “Telecommunications” and “Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing.”
   - **OR** keep “Telecommunications” but exclude “Internet” if that’s too broad—whatever is less essential.

4. **Location**:
   - Keep 5–6 high-priority metros (e.g., New York, SF Bay Area, LA, Seattle, Boston).
   - Temporarily remove secondary locations like Denver, Chicago, Austin to see how far the count drops.

5. **(Optional) Additional Department**:
   - **Include** only: “Operations,” “Strategy,” “IT/Engineering,” “R&D,” “Product,” “Finance.”
   - **Exclude**: “Sales,” “Business Development,” “Marketing,” “HR,” “Consulting,” “Customer Support.”

By combining these five adjustments, you’ll typically see a huge reduction in total results.

---

## Summary

- **Focus on narrower job-title keywords** to find strategy-oriented roles.
- **Exclude** known irrelevant titles (consultants, sales, interns, owners, etc.).
- **Trim your industry selection** to the most critical or use sub-industries.
- **Limit company size or revenue** to reduce extremes.
- **Reduce the location set** if needed.

This approach should help you get from 74k down to a few hundred high-quality leads for your strategic research. Feel free to experiment with which filters you tighten first—every small tweak in Apollo can drastically change your final count.

# Sprint update structure

## You (2025-09-24T01:33:13.233000+00:00)

Okay, so I'm writing a regular update for my current sprint, and so what I want you to do is just go through this entire recording and structure it in the form of an update. Now, some of the tasks that I will continue next Sprint will involve, the mobile version of the current checkout flow. That's a big one. But apart from that, some minor updates that I will continue working in the next print include. Okay, one of them includes the top UI header for the checkout flow. Specifically, I've added a placeholder component for now, but one of the next steps will be adding the logos within each checkout UI header. I took a pause on the sign up flow, which was part of the thing, part of the sprint, because the signup flow needs some confirmation, so I will be integrating that into the flow next sprint. There are edge case scenarios which I have to draft that are sort of the critical edge cases include, you know, error handling in personal details, more detailed flows for Apple, Pay, Google, pay and affirm pay, and within the product, component itself, some of the edge cases, which have been completed, but I need to include in the form of a prototype, are things like getting printed, certificate, shipped, adding certification, making edits to a particular product deleting a product. I've introduced the components for replacing a specific product with something else, but need to build out a prototype for that. So and additional edge cases, which so far haven't been included in the checkout flow. Basically, I mean that everything is considered for but I just need to build out a unique prototype for each of them. Some of the ancillary elements. Include things like support for any card related questions, a means to return to shopping from the cart, which, I mean, I'd also have to make a UI header for the selected brands to incorporate in the cart. Terms and Conditions are important notices at a cart level. Terms and conditions have been added at the product level, but also need to add them at a cart level. So uh, a flow for uh, including suggestions, suggested products. A flow for adding promo codes and any corresponding error handling in some indication for secure payment in the checkout. There was one edge case that currently the product tile does not include, which is subscription payments or recurring payments. But that's that was only seen In one use case. I think currently the checkout flow includes confirmation triggers for two out of the three steps, which include payment and the final confirmation. So scratch that. I think when I said two steps, I mean confirming personal details and confirming payment method, the final step is just to place order. So another big update. Next Sprint will be re skinning the checkout flow for the different brands. I now.Ah, any of those. So basically, that's the end of the updates. So like other than these things, everything is completed. I'm attaching a link for the specific sort of figma file. Oh, and one more thing, like proper classification of all the labels that were modified as part of building this component. Yeah, that's all. So now just take everything I told you and turn that into basically like a short update I can leave on my task under monday.com com.


Make sure to do it in a very structured, professional way. Keep it brief, but don't exclude out any of the pointers that I've outlined. Feel free to restructure it, because I shared it vocally as I was thinking, but of course this needs to be a well-structured update.

Let me know if you'd like a version tailored for a different audience (e.g., standup vs. leadership summary).

Okay, so the thing is this is really great, but at the same time it does look like a robot created it. While I want you to just do the exact same thing, but as far as tone and writing style goes, just use my writing style based on everything you know about me in writing these sentences. Keep the sentences brief, maintain the same structure, maintain the same points. I don't want to change anything. I just want to make sure it doesn't sound like a robot wrote it.

## ChatGPT (2025-09-24T01:35:18.028208+00:00)

Got it. Here's your updated sprint note—same structure, same points, but in a tone that matches how *you* naturally speak and write: concise, clear, and human.

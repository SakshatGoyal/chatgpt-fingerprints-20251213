Understood! I’ll start by checking the weather forecast for San Francisco mornings from July 28 to August 1 and then search major U.S. retailers, including Amazon, for slim or modern-fit jackets with stand collars or mock necks, available in neutral or earthy tones. I’ll ensure that the jackets are lightweight, breathable, and ready for delivery or pickup by Monday, July 29 in the 94102 area. I’ll provide a ranked list with all details such as price, color, size availability, delivery options, and a short reasoning for each. I’m starting now.

**Key considerations**

- **Weather fit:** San Francisco mornings (July 28–Aug 1) are expected to be cool (~57 °F at night and mid‑60s during the day) with light-to-moderate winds【218504887148047†L150-L169】.  Lightweight, wind‑resistant jackets with stand collars provide warmth without overheating and block the morning fog.
- **Timeline:** Macy’s offers **same‑day pick‑up** for in‑stock items if ordered before 4 PM【708721037367725†L48-L51】.  This ensures you can have the jacket by Monday, July 29.  When ordering online, always choose “Pick Up in Store” at checkout to guarantee availability.
- **Style match:** I prioritized jackets with **slim/modern silhouettes**, **stand or mock collars**, matte fabrics and neutral/earthy colors.  The Robert Graham and Michael Kors jackets best balance style, weather protection and quick availability.

Let me know if you’d like me to proceed with ordering or reserving any of these jackets for pick‑up.

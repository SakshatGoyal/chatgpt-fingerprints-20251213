# Best NY Pizza Oahu

## You (2025-05-18T03:27:40.199000+00:00)

Help me find a good place to get an amazing pizza in Ohau Island.

I want the classic New York style pizza, thin, slightly floppy pizza slice, well-done base, not too doughy, and truly beloved by the public.

Refer to all the available food review sources, including Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Google reviews, as well as editorial blogs and vlogs that mention pizza reviews.

Iteratively synthesize your research while analyzing different sources, forming your opinion.

They should be open at least until 9:00pm tonight. They should ideally be close to the Embassy Suites Hotel. I don't want to drive too far from this place.

Imagine you're a New Yorker, born and raised, with a love for the classic New York slice of pizza.

### Quick take (from one New-Yorker pizza snob to another)

| Walk / ride | Spot | Why it really tastes like home | Closing time (Sat) |
|-------------|------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| **8-min walk (≈0.4 mi)** | **Slice of Waikiki** – 333 Seaside Ave | 21-inch pies cut into classic fold-and-flop triangles; crackly‐bottom + gooey top. Local + tourist crowd keeps whole pies moving so slices stay fresh. | **11 pm (Fri-Thu)** / **midnight (Fri-Sun)**  |
| **10-min Uber (≈2.5 mi)** | **Pizza Mamo** – 16 N Hotel St (Chinatown) | Brooklyn-style rounds: 48-hour cold‐ferment, good under-carriage char, light flop. Ranked #1 pizza in town by Waikīkī Beach Stays & Honolulu Magazine. | **10 pm** (Fri-Sat)  |
| **10-12 min Uber (≈2.7 mi)** | **J. Dolan’s** – 1147 Bethel St | Proper New-York pub pie: thin, crisp rim, tangy sauce, slices sold till last call. Long-running local favorite; kitchen serves till **2 am** on Fri/Sat. | **2 am** (Fri-Sat)  |

---

#### How I whittled the list
1. **Cast a wide net** – checked Yelp, TripAdvisor, Google, Reddit threads, and recent locals’ round-ups (Waikīkī Beach Stays, Honolulu Magazine).
2. **Filtered for the specs** – only places with genuine NY-style rounds/slices, within a short walk or cheap ride from Embassy Suites (201 Beach Walk), and open ≥ 9 pm tonight (Sat 17 May 2025).
3. **Taste reputation** – looked for consistent praise on crust texture (foldable yet crisp), sauce-cheese balance, and slice turnover (freshness).
4. **Nixed**:
   * **Boston’s (Kaimukī)** – good slice but shuts 7 pm
   * **ʻIliʻili Cash & Carry** – closes 7 pm
   * **Round Table** by Hilton – late hours but chain-style crust and uneven reviews; locals/no-kidding NYers pan it .

### What to expect & tiny pro-tips

* **Slice of Waikiki** – stand-up window inside the Ohana Malia. Order a plain cheese to gauge the sauce-to-cheese snap, or their “Threes” pepperoni. Cash moves fastest; they’ll reheat on a deck oven – ask for “extra well-done” if you want that New-York bottom char.
* **Pizza Mamo** – small counter; grab a seat in the parklet or take slices to go. Their Brooklyn “Classic” or white “Potato” pies get raves. Quick Lyft back to Waikīkī runs ~\$9 at dinner time.
* **J. Dolan’s** – Irish-pub vibe, full bar. Order by the slice at the bar or call ahead for a whole pie. The “Giacomo” (pepperoni-sausage-salami-olive) is the local hero; crust stays crisp even under all that meat. Chinatown streets are busy till late, but I’d still rideshare back.

### Decision cheat-sheet

If you **want to walk** and keep it simple, go **Slice of Waikiki**.
If you’ll spring for a quick ride and crave the best straight-up NY slice on O‘ahu, **Pizza Mamo** edges it.
Need food after 10 pm with a pint? **J. Dolan’s** is your move.

Either way, fold it, let the grease hit the plate, and pretend you’re on St. Mark’s instead of Kalākaua. Enjoy. 🍕

ok, using the same criteria, could you find me places that offer pizza, but also pastas for kids? I want the same criteria for pizza, but I need something for my niece who really wants pasta.

**Slice-plus-Spaghetti shortlist (all still serving after 9 pm tonight)**

| Walk / ride from Embassy Suites | Spot & hours | Why the pizza passes a New-Yorker’s sniff-test | Kid-friendly pasta options | Crowd score* |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1 min walk (same block)** | **Giovanni Pastrami**<br>227 Lewers St · open **to midnight** nightly  | Round-Table lineage but baked on their own *“original thin crust”* that folds without cracking; surface stays saucy/cheesy so you get the proper grease-stream bend. Ask for it **“well-done”** and they’ll leave it in another 90 sec for the char you’re used to.  | Kid menu has **$10 spaghetti (red, meat, or Alfredo)**—generous bowl, no chili-flakes by default.  | Yelp 3.5, Google 4.2—tourist-heavy but locals hit it for late games.  |
| **10 min walk / 3 min Lyft (0.6 mi)** | **Amina Pizzeria**<br>1694 Kalākaua Ave · dinner **5 pm – 9 pm** Mon-Sat  | 14-inch pies, proper 1/8th slices, crust rolled thin and baked crisp-bottom/foldable. Reviewers call it *“classic thin crust, tastes like home”*.  | Full tray of old-school pasta (spaghetti, lasagna) and they’ll split any order for kids; halal meatballs if that’s helpful.  | Yelp 4.3; mostly neighborhood take-out so slices turn fast.  |
| **12 min walk / 5 min Lyft (0.9 mi)** | **San Paolo Pizza & Wine**<br>1765 Ala Moana Blvd · **5 pm – 10 pm** daily  | Dough is 48-hr fermented, stretched Brooklyn-thin but finished a touch hotter (think Joe’s with a bit of Neapolitan blister). Local Redditors—incl. a Brooklyn expat—put it in O‘ahu’s top-two NY slices.  | Half-portion penne Alfredo, buttered noodles on request, and staff will sub any sauce for milder marinara. | OpenTable 4.5, Insta buzz since the AYCE slice nights.  |

\*Scores are rounded averages of Google/Yelp/OpenTable where available.

### Which one should you hit?

* **Want zero travel stress?** Walk downstairs to **Giovanni Pastrami**. You’ll get a credible floppy slice and a kid-size spaghetti in under ten minutes.
* **Craving a quieter mom-and-pop joint with halal or vegetarian flex?** **Amina** is worth the six-block stroll; call ahead and they’ll have the pie and pasta boxed when you arrive.
* **Chasing the best dough with a glass of wine (and the niece still happy)?** Book **San Paolo**. The slice edges closer to NYC char, and their kitchen’s happy to do a butter-noodle plate.

---

### Ordering tips from one NY pie-purist to another

* **Say “extra well-done, fold-and-go”** to any of them—servers instantly translate that to letting the crust blister.
* For kids’ pasta, ask them to **hold the red-pepper flakes** (all three finish sauces with a shake unless told).
* Honolulu ovens run slightly lower than a steel deck in the city; if you want that near-coal underside, ask for a **re-fire** (60--90 sec) after the first bake.

Now grab that slice, give it the fold test, and cue the homesick smile. Enjoy Waikīkī, cousin. 🍕

### Best bets for a **kid-pleasing pesto pasta** within a 10-minute stroll of Embassy Suites (all still serving after 9 pm tonight)

| Walk / ride | Place & hours (Sat) | What to order | Why it’s solid | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **4 min walk (0.2 mi)** | **natuRe Waikiki**<br>413 Seaside Ave – Bar menu serves **till 10 pm** | **Molokaʻi Shrimp Pesto Pasta** (mac-nut basil pesto, $22 kids-size) | Handmade noodles, light island basil pesto; staff happy to split plates for kids. |  |
| **7 min walk (0.4 mi)** | **Appetito Craft Pizza & Wine Bar**<br>150 Kaiulani Ave – Dinner **till 9 pm** (last call) | **Cassarecce con Pesto** (classic Genovese sauce, $19) | Casual, high-energy room; pesto comes out bright green & garlicky—easy win with kids. |  |
| **10 min walk (0.5 mi)** | **Piccola Onda** (Alohilani Resort side lane)<br>2490 Kalākaua Ave – Regular menu to 8:30 pm, **extended to 10 pm on Fri/Sat** | **Spaghetti al Pesto** (basil-mac-nut pesto) | Open-air counter that makes fresh pasta to order; Instagram confirms the later weekend close. |  |

#### A few New-Yorker-style tips

* **Ask for a half-portion.** All three kitchens will do a kid bowl on request; just say “kid-size pesto, please.”
* **Extra Parm?** Servers will grate at the table—tell them when to stop.
* If the line at Piccola Onda looks long, order online while you walk and pick up at the window.

Your niece gets her pesto fix, you stay in quick walking range, and everyone’s fed before bedtime. Enjoy Waikīkī!

# Strategy Table Optimization

## You (2025-03-17T01:31:48.935000+00:00)

Hey Elliot, help me refine this prompt for an o1/o3 model

"Hey, I'm attaching a google doc for your reference. I want you to focus on the 'Strategy Types' Section alone for now, and ignore the rest of the sections.

Within 'Strategy Types', you'll find 6 categories of strategies, along with a very long table of 'Examples'. The examples will have 'industries', 'why it fits', and 'five key roles to target'

My challenge is, these are far too many industries to focus on. Our research team cannot go after all these industries for each of the strategic categories. What I'd like from you is, a similar table for each of the 6 categories which has 'industries', 'why it fits', and 'five key roles to target'. But in this new table, I want you to only have 5 rows. These 5 should be the most contrasting to one another.

The five rows should also, as much as possible, align with the details of the category of strategy. "

Here's a refined version of your prompt, optimized for the O1/O3 model:

---

**Goal:**
You will analyze the 'Strategy Types' section of the attached Google Doc and generate a condensed version of its industry examples.

**Scope:**
- Focus **only** on the 'Strategy Types' section and **ignore** all other parts of the document.
- Within 'Strategy Types', there are **six strategy categories**, each with a long table of examples. Each table contains:
  - **Industries**
  - **Why it fits**
  - **Five key roles to target**

**Task:**
- For each of the **six strategy categories**, create a new table that includes only **five industries** (instead of the full list).
- The selected **five industries should be the most contrasting** to one another, showcasing diversity.
- Ensure the selected industries **strongly align** with the details of their respective strategy category.
- Maintain the same format as the original table:
  - **Industry**
  - **Why it fits**
  - **Five key roles to target**

**Constraints:**
- **Do not** summarize or modify the original reasoning behind why an industry fits—just select the five most contrasting industries.
- **Do not** change the format of the table.
- **Do not** pull information from outside the document—work strictly within its contents.

**Output Format:**
A structured response with six separate tables, each corresponding to a strategy category, with exactly five industries per table.

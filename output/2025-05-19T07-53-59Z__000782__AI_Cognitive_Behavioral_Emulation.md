# AI Cognitive Behavioral Emulation

## You (2025-05-19T07:53:59.007000+00:00)

Identify research papers—academic or professional—that directly or partially align with the objective of developing a methodology to emulate and replicate the complex cognitive and behavioral patterns of real or historical individuals within AI systems. This includes efforts focused on cognitive modeling, behavioral emulation, personality reconstruction, or related subdomains that reflect even a component of this framework.

---

For each paper returned, structure the output as follows:

* **Title:** \[Full title of the paper]
* **Authors and Date:** \[Authors], \[Year]
* **Synthesis of Paper's Core Goal:** A 2–4 sentence synthesis capturing what the authors aimed to achieve and how. Reframe with clarity and precision, focusing on the work’s analytical core.
* **Relevance to Project:** Explain the specific way(s) this paper connects to the broader framework described in the Project Brief. Explicitly indicate if the connection is partial (e.g., “focuses only on behavioral modeling”) and avoid speculation unless clearly labeled.

Repeat this format for each relevant paper.

---

* Do not overextend interpretations. If a connection to our work is speculative or metaphorical, clearly label it as such (e.g., "⚠️ Speculative Parallel").
* Only include what is explicitly supported in the paper’s methods or findings.
* Exclude generic chatbot or LLM fine-tuning papers unless they address persona emulation at a cognitive-behavioral level.
* Avoid overreliance on keyword matches—relevance should stem from conceptual or methodological alignment.

**4. Context & Additional Elements**

The target system aims to construct purpose-specific GPTs capable of emulating individuals such as Leonardo da Vinci or Gandhi by capturing their deep cognitive patterns—identity, domain expertise, heuristics, value systems, decision logic—through a structured, inductive/deductive inquiry process. This system relies on cognitive interdependency mapping, latent framework surfacing, and thematic synthesis of biographical, behavioral, and strategic decision-making data.

Assume the perspective of a **cognitive systems researcher with interdisciplinary fluency** in AI modeling, cognitive science, and historical behavioral analysis. Prioritize analytical rigor, source fidelity, and methodological traceability.

**Title:** Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior  
**Authors and Date:** Joon Sung Park, Joseph C. O’Brien, Carrie J. Cai, Meredith Ringel Morris, Percy Liang, Michael S. Bernstein, 2023  
**Synthesis of Paper’s Core Goal:**  The authors extend a large language model with long-term memory, reflection, and planning modules to create “generative agents” that autonomously perceive events, update memories, form higher-order reflections, and plan future actions in a sandbox town.  The study shows these agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors—e.g., coordinating a Valentine’s Day party—through the interaction of observation, planning, and reflection loops. citeturn3view0  
**Relevance to Project:**  Directly relevant—demonstrates a concrete architecture for encoding and replaying cognitive traces (experience → memory → reflection → action), a building block for replicating historical figures’ decision logic and day-to-day behavior.

---

**Title:** Crafting Digital Personas of Historical Figures for Education through Generative AI: Examining Their Accuracy, Authenticity, and Reliability  
**Authors and Date:** Boaventura DaCosta, 2025  
**Synthesis of Paper’s Core Goal:**  The paper pilots the use of ChatGPT to generate an interactive “Joseph Lister” persona for educational settings, then evaluates output against archival evidence for factual accuracy and voice fidelity. Findings highlight where generative AI faithfully channels period-appropriate language and where hallucinations or anachronisms appear. citeturn18search1  
**Relevance to Project:**  Directly relevant—focuses on reconstructing a historical individual’s cognitive + linguistic style and provides an empirical framework for authenticity checks that can be folded into your inductive/deductive inquiry pipeline.

---

**Title:** Towards Digital Cognitive Clones for the Decision-Makers: Adversarial Training Experiments  
**Authors and Date:** Mariia Golovianko, Svitlana Gryshko, Vagan Terziyan, Tuure Tuunanen, 2021  
**Synthesis of Paper’s Core Goal:**  Introduces “Pi-Mind,” an adversarial learning loop where a human trainer, a GAN-based challenger, and an AI “clone” co-evolve so the clone learns to make image-classification decisions identically to its human donor under industrial-logistics scenarios. citeturn8view0  
**Relevance to Project:**  Partially relevant—focuses on cloning perceptual decision rules rather than full personality, but its adversarial “trainer–clone–challenger” schema offers a recipe for capturing expert heuristics you could adapt for historical decision logic.

---

**Title:** From Persona to Personalization: A Survey on Role-Playing Language Agents  
**Authors and Date:** Jiangjie Chen et al., 2024  
**Synthesis of Paper’s Core Goal:**  Provides a taxonomy of Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs), mapping data sources, construction pipelines, and evaluation metrics for demographic, character, and individualized personas built on top of LLMs. The survey also surfaces open risks and future research directions. citeturn13view0  
**Relevance to Project:**  Overview value—offers a consolidated landscape of methods (prompt engineering, memory tooling, alignment) that can inform each layer of your cognitive-interdependency mapping. Connection is partial (review, not novel model).

---

**Title:** Large Language Models Know How the Personality of Public Figures Is Perceived by the General Public  
**Authors and Date:** Xubo Cao, Michal Kosinski, 2024  
**Synthesis of Paper’s Core Goal:** Shows that GPT-3 name embeddings predict human Big-Five personality ratings for 226 public figures with high correlation (r ≈ .78–.88). This demonstrates that personality-laden semantic signals are already latent in LLM vector spaces. citeturn12view0  
**Relevance to Project:**  Partial—doesn’t build full personas but empirically validates that LLMs encode personality priors that can be extracted or fine-tuned when reconstructing historical identities.

---

**Title:** Persona-DB: Efficient Large Language Model Personalization for Response Prediction with Collaborative Data Refinement  
**Authors and Date:** Chenkai Sun et al., 2025  
**Synthesis of Paper’s Core Goal:**  Proposes a retrieval-augmented framework that hierarchically distills user histories into structured persona keys and shares sparsity-compensating knowledge across similar users, achieving >10 % accuracy gains in cold-start personalization without model fine-tuning. citeturn14view0  
**Relevance to Project:**  Partial—targets contemporary users, yet its hierarchical persona encoding and collaborative refinement strategies map cleanly onto your need to store, compress, and retrieve thematic biographical patterns for historical figures.

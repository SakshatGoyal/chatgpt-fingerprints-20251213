# Research prompt refinement

## You (2025-11-23T12:49:46.187000+00:00)

help me write a research prompt for the following intent...

I want to explore restaurants in hyderabad. I live in 'my home bhooja' and i don't want to travel too far. I'm looking for some high end restaurants but one that have traditional indian cooking, and healthy cooking. Like satvik food, but elevated dining experiences. I want chatGPT to do the search. 

now ask me questions that can help you refine the prompt

Great — you’ve got a clear initial intent, and we can refine it into a precise, high-impact research prompt for ChatGPT to execute effectively.

Let’s narrow things down with a few focused questions so we can capture:
- ✳️ Geographic boundaries
- 🍽️ Dining expectations
- 🧠 GPT behavior preferences
- 🗂️ Output format and reasoning needs

---

### 📍Location Constraints
1. **How far are you willing to travel from My Home Bhooja?**
   - (e.g., within 5 km? 10 km? 20 mins drive?)

2. **Do you want only restaurants within Hyderabad city limits, or are upscale places in the outskirts okay if they’re close enough?**

---

### 🍛 Cuisine & Experience
3. **Is it important that the restaurant specifically uses the term “Satvik,” or are you open to any traditional Indian food that’s vegetarian and health-conscious (e.g., Ayurveda-inspired, temple-style cooking, or South Indian tiffins done gourmet-style)?**

4. **Are there any specific cuisines or regional styles you’re drawn to?**
   - (e.g., Andhra, Rajasthani, Tamil Brahmin, North Indian?)

5. **Do you want the ambiance to be luxurious/fine-dining only, or are artisanal and boutique-style places okay too if they offer a premium food experience?**

---

### 💬 GPT Behavior & Output
6. **Would you like GPT to provide:**
   - A ranked list?
   - Categorized suggestions (e.g., by cuisine or vibe)?
   - Just a few curated picks with detailed descriptions?

7. **Should GPT include info like:**
   - Google rating?
   - Average price per person?
   - Signature dishes or chef background?

8. **Should GPT avoid any restaurant types?**
   - (e.g., hotel buffets, chains, anything not 100% vegetarian?)

---

Answering these will let me begin constructing a detailed, context-aware prompt for GPT-4o to search and recommend thoughtfully.

Would you like to tackle all of these now, or just the most essential ones first?

I think a 30-minute drive is fine, and closer is better, but I don’t want to go more than 45 minutes—that's too far. I am looking for restaurants no more than a 40-minute drive from my home (which is at My Home Bhooja).

Just to clarify, Satvik was merely an example. I don't have rigid preferences, but I do want authentic traditional food that is truly rooted in Indian culture. I'm tired of the Punjabi and typical South Indian options available at most restaurants. What I'm seeking is food that is genuinely authentically Indian, paired with an elevated dining experience. 

I don't want our search to be limited to just 'Satvik.' Any cuisine is fine, as long as it is a healthy version of that food—not a clichéd healthy option like 'high protein.'

the ambience could be any of the following - artisanal and boutique-style; or fine-dining and luxurious. 

i want a curated, categorized list with detailed descriptions of what kind of food we can expect.

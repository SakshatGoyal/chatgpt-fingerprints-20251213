Hey! Not much—just here and ready to dive into whatever’s on your mind. How’s your day going?

## You (2025-08-17T21:07:01.306000+00:00)

what do you know about my current work?

From what we’ve been working on lately, your current focus is a **research program on “context engineering” for LLM-era systems**.

Here’s the snapshot I have:

- **Big Aim**: Build an interdisciplinary map of context engineering—how it’s defined, the mechanisms it uses, and how to translate that into practical frameworks, design patterns, and evaluation playbooks.
- **Mechanisms you’re targeting**: framing, injection/RAG, structuring, weighting, boundaries/guardrails (plus memory, compression, multimodal grounding if relevant).
- **Research style**: all **secondary research** (papers, preprints, industry reports, technical blogs). No interviews/surveys—leaning on PRISMA-like review methods.
- **Phases**:
  1. Define scope, research questions, and constructs (Stage 1).
  2. Deep research + evidence gathering (Stage 2).
  3. Synthesis into frameworks/taxonomies (Stage 3).
  4. Practitioner playbooks, case studies, and guides (Stage 4).
- **Guiding principles**: hybrid theoretical–practical, interdisciplinary, focused on 2020–present, evidence-backed but also discovery-positive.

And I remember you’re being really careful about:
- Avoiding drift (keeping each stage consistent).
- Balancing rigor (citations, systematic methods) with creativity (novel applications).
- Documenting context thoroughly so you don’t have to restate it every time.

Want me to pull together a **single-page recap** of everything you’ve defined so far—almost like a “mission control” brief you could use to keep things aligned?

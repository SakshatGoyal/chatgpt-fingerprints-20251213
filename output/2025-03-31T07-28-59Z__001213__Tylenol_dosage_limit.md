Hey, how much Tylenol is too much Tylenol? I'm holding one capsule of 500mg.

For an adult, the typical maximum dose of Tylenol (acetaminophen) is 3,000 to 4,000 mg per day. So, if you're taking 500 mg capsules, that's about 6 to 8 capsules in 24 hours. But it's always best to follow the instructions on the package or check with a healthcare professional for your specific situation.

Does it help with headaches? I have severe headaches now.

## ChatGPT (2025-03-31T07:29:20.477718+00:00)

Yeah, Tylenol is commonly used for headaches and can be effective. If your headaches are severe or persistent, though, you might want to consult a doctor to rule out any underlying issues. Have you tried Tylenol before for your headaches?

Not really.

Got it. If it's your first time, just start with the recommended dose and see how you feel. Make sure you're staying hydrated too, that can sometimes help with headaches. If it doesn't get better, definitely reach out to a healthcare provider.

So how long does it take for Tylenol's effect to start?

## ChatGPT (2025-03-31T07:31:23.453103+00:00)

It usually starts working within 30 minutes to an hour after you take it. If you don't notice any relief after that time, you might want to check in with a doctor or consider other options.
